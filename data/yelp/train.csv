"Okay, I am not sure if I did a review on this location. If not, I truly apologize. Its been very hectic with lifestyle lately so I am about to a lot of reviews today.   I have been to many Chipotle Mexican Grills and always hope that my next location would be better than the first time. I think I just need to quit going to any establishment altogether.   The tofu was very spicy, almost too spicy for me to eat with my bowl. The food was mediocre I can say the least. I will not be back to any Chipotle Mexican Grill.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I've been here before for lunch with my girlfriends and thought it was ok. Recently we decided to return on a Sunday for brunch. It was extremely busy and we were seated in a corner outside near the dog's water dish. Yes, you read that correctly, there was a water dish for dogs next to our table. The four of us ordered, two got the Reuben, one the huevos rancheros, I got the seared tuna salad. Prior to ordering the Huevos Rancheros my friend asked the waiter if she could have her poached eggs well cooked. Our server checked with the kitchen and returned to say yes, that's no problem. Of course the eggs came out under cooked, it was returned to the kitchen. When her dish returned it had three cold hard boiled eggs stuck on top. We actually laughed at the kitchens obvious flip off. The waiter was summoned, then the manager. He took the dish off of our tab, but it really left a bad impression on us. My tuna salad was fine. The Reuben sandwiches were a disappointment, the corned beef was grey. The one friend that asked for the thousand island dressing in the side received the dressing in a cup with sauerkraut in it, obviously after inspecting the sandwich that had remnants of sauerkraut and dressing, it was scrapped off of the sandwich. Overall a very disappointing visit, and it will be our last.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I have mixed feeling about this place..  Pros: -the BEST vietnamese iced coffee in the area! one of the waiters told me that they added vanilla to make it more tasty/creamy -good variety on the menu. if you stop by, try the banh xeo or mi xao don. -reasonable prices  Cons: -a BIG issue for me is the lack of awareness that management has about having customers in their restaurant! the last time we went, they were re-lacquering(?) their tables which made the ENTIRE restaurant smell like chemicals! i'm not talking about cleaning sprays or even household bleach - we're talking about industrial strength fumes! they didnt even open any doors until they were finished! they started after we gave our orders but i almost requested to leave because the smell really made me want to stop breathing; lost my appetite right away. I did not understand why they were doing that inside or during business hours with customers eating! -they seem to be.. overstaffed? so a lot of times all of the waiters sit around a table, chat, eat, and forget about the customers. I dont mind that if the place is near empty or theres down time.. but when i see 6-7 waiters just sitting around and not getting up even once after taking orders, it starts to seem unprofessional. Its really hard to catch one without having to go up to the cashier counter.  Pho is OK, nothing remarkable; sometimes its really good, sometimes it tastes day-old with mushy noodles. Spring rolls are great - i would recommend as their portions are larger than most.  I havent gone back there since the chemical incidence. That and the service was just consistently awful. Never felt like a customer there.. it feels like youre the inconvenience thats stopping by for 45min.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I've been to a couple of the other locations a number of times over the years, and my overall assessment is the food is expensive and average-tasting at best. Our server greeted us and was nice, but the service is definitely not anything spectacular.   The table-side salsa is their redeeming grace. They make it fresh to your liking, and it is good. Our chips were definitely not fresh though.   My husband just wanted some tacos a la carte, but I didn't see that option on the menu anywhere. A two-taco combo plate was $15. He ended up with the Panchovilla plate, which had carne asada, an enchilada, and a chile relleno. He said the carne was not very good. I ordered a chicken tortilla soup, and it was just okay. I've honestly made better at home.  The best advice I can give is to go across the street to El Charro. The prices are the same, but the food is much better.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I got the brown stew chicken with rice and peas and vegetables. I thought it was ok. My family is Jamaican so I was excited to eat some good Jamaican good again and it was ok.

This is the first time I had ramen made from a restaurant and I'm not impressed. The pork belly was a bit dry but also overly fatty as well. I brought the spicy miso broth one and the taste is something I can make with instant ramen which is a major disappointment because I spent $17 on something I can make at home without much prior knowledge about it. Also the noodles weren't that great. It was stuck together which is what happen if you didn't drain it properly and left it on the bowl. It was hard trying to loosen the noodles so in the end I just took big bites.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I really wanted to love this place. I love Thai food and I'm a huge fan of the Bangkok in Dallas but this place is average at its best. Came here for lunch with my mom and ordered the spicy basil noodle and sweet and sour chicken. The sweet and sour chicken was over sauced and oversweet.  The spicy basil noodles were sort of bland and had a smell to it and lacked flavor.  The restaurant is clean and the service is very attentive. Overall, I was not impressed and would probably try to find better Thai food in town.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I wanted to like this place bc it would be so convenient as I live on the island. Unfortunately, I have to echo what other reviewers have said regarding the poor quality of service. Pizza was decent but Here's where it went wrong:   1- Poor phone line. Called and for whatever reason there was a problem with the line so it was hard to hear. There was a lot of static. Could not get through. Odd for a pizza delivery service. I should have taken that as a sign but Since I live on the island, I drove there since my friends wanted pizza.   2- Misleading Yelp voucher. purchased the Yelp deal and although it says this no where on the fine print, the $15 for $20 deal, according to the girl in the cash register can only be redeemed in $5 increments. Um what? That should be listed on the fine print.   3. Poor service. When she brought out the food I apologized for not telling her it was actually for carry out and she was visibly irritated I hadn't told her beforehand. But she didn't bother communicating it to the staff bc another server brought out more food on plates. Told the other guy who was much friendlier and brought the food back out packaged to go.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The location is nice but I don't understand the reviews for awesome food. I had the shrimp and mahi lemongrass (cant remember the name) it was subpar and tasteless. Pretty sure I was frozen fish boiled and thrown on rice My husband had paella and said it was also ..eh Out guac and chips came served with out entre.  We sat on the water and it got windy. Because it was windy the manager turned off the fans and then we were covered with flies. Thank God we were done.  Last point not really the fault of the establishment but the waiter serving behind us started yapping about how he hoped it would rain soon so he could go home and play his xbox. Be quiet.

I usually am only inspired to leave a review when a place is off the charts amazing OR just absolutely had a horrible experience usually more with the service than anything else. This was neither but felt compelled to review as SO MANY PEOPLE rave about the sandwiches.   The lines were huge people were excited to order. After reading the reviews and seeing all this I was REALLY excited for our meal. We ordered the pork with sharp provolone an brocolli rabe and a brisket with sharp prov and sweet peppers.   The service was great. Atmosphere great. The sandwiches. Decidedly not great. Just really far from great. Bread was fantastic but all else was just really underwhelming.

"I really liked Cozy Corner when I first started coming here and they only used to do breakfast. Unfortunately, now that they have a liquor license and serve dinner too, the wait times had just been sooo long. It also doesn't help that we came here for brunch/lunch time on a Sunday. Maybe they get backed up quite a bit as they also do uber eats? I just feel disappointed too because I feel like our server could have been more apologetic but they were all acting so surprised and not one of them wanted to admit fault. Not once did I hear, ""I'm sorry for the wait"". I mean they gave the food for free but honestly, if they didn't I wouldn't even pay for it because to say the least, it was the saddest meal I've ever had served to me. I mean after an hour waiting they served me the hatch heat chicken sandwich with the bread burnt and they tried to hide it by putting it underneath. It came with a plate of raw tomatoes that were supposed to have been inside the sandwich but it was just weird. On top of that, my bf ordered 2 orders of biscuits and gravy, and an hour in of waiting they told us they're out. At the least his french toast was actually good though. I really like Cozy Corner and would definitely give them another try but hopefully they can improve their customer service and the quality of their food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Bady Bady...  I finally had the chance to experience the much raved-about Goody Goody Burgers with my mom on a rainy Monday. Every time my husband and I would pass it on the weekends it was packed, with a long line. I understand that this was a hoping place in Tampa decades ago and perhaps there was a reason why it disappeared...   Pro: the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. The server was friendly, attentive and answered our questions regarding the menu. The food came out quickly and correctly. The restaurant is conveniently located in Hyde Park which is why I suspect it is so popular.   Con: honestly the food was not that good. I ordered the cheeseburger with their ""special sauce"" on the side and fries. If you want anything on the side you have to make an additional order. The burger was bland and  forgettable not to mention the slice of cheese was so small I had to check to make sure it actually was a cheeseburger. Their special sauce tasted like marinara and didn't add to the burger's flavor. Just stick with good ol' ketchup. The fries were your basic freezer fries.   My mom ordered the omelette with tomatoes, feta and spinach. She reported that the spinach was over cooked and that she had to add hot sauce, salt and pepper to give it some flavor. She didn't eat it all.   Goody Goody lacks flavor and freshness.  Tip: go a couple of miles down the road and have a delightful meal at Daily Eats!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Had an early dinner here. Hubby liked his orange beef. My seafood fried rice was OK, the portion enough for 3, of course most of that rice, with the scallops gritty, ""prawns"" small.

Maybe it was not grease, but it was something sticky.  I think I will try another Chinese place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I ordered a meatball sub. Patrice, one of the sandwich makers, told me that they were out of meatballs. She suggested something else. I said the bbq chicken cheesesteak. She said ok pay for your ticket and other items and I'll make it. So I did and I waited about five minutes. Meanwhile I hear higher numbers than mine being called out. So I go up to Patrice asking about my sandwich. She says yes I made it it's down here. So she asked this guy who is also a sandwich maker ""Where is number 887? Did you see it?"" He says ""Yeah they picked it up."" Patrice says ""No they didn't. She's right there."" So he says nonchalantly ""Oh well someone else picked it up."" Patrice told him ""That's why you have to look at the tickets."" He said ""I did."" Patrice says obviously you didn't because she didn't get her sandwich. So Patrice proceeded to make my sandwich and called me over and said I'm going to personally hand it to you. I thanked her and left. The only reason I would ever considering going back to this Wawa is because of Patrice. She was super helpful and fixed the problem. The male sandwich maker's attitude was unacceptable. He never apologized and was totally nonchalant about giving away my food that I paid for which is unacceptable. Tickets need to be read everytime to prevent this from happening.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

He kind of rushed off and got the tostada with fish that was OK but kind of greasy..upset stomach for both of us. The only positive was the tri tip sandwich was decent.

"I'll start by saying I've been to 3 or 4 other El Maguey in the area, and they've all been pretty good. This one however was terrible. There are many other places to go in The Loop. I'd recommend going elsewhere.   First of all, when you walk in, there are multiple signs that say ""15% gratuity added to bill"". We always tip 15-20 percent, even for average service, so didn't think much of it...The place wasn't even that busy and the server came to our table a total of 3 times in the span of an Hour!!! Once to take our food and drink order. Another time to drop off drinks. And another time to drop off our food. We never got re-fills and i basically had to flag this guy down to get the bill...I guess they figure since they are going to add 15% to the bill, they should do the least amount of work to earn their money?!  After finishing our meal, we had to wait 15 minutes to get the bill. At this point, we were trying to catch a show down the street, so we were in a hurry and didn't review the items on the bill. By the time i signed the receipt, i noticed he had charged us $1 extra on both entrees we ordered ($2 total)....I was going to ask for a manager, but like i said, we were in a rush after waiting 15 minutes to pay so I figured I'd rather not argue over 2 whole dollars. I'd rather leave and enjoy the rest of my night.   The food was average to above average which is why I didn't give this place 1 star. We will never go back!!! Like I said, There are so many places to go in The Loop, and this place is at the bottom of the list. What a rip off!!!

"Today I had a terrible craving for barbecue and decided to get a pulled-pork sandwich to go. I'd heard some not-so-encouraging things about this place but thought I'd give it a chance.  I lived in Memphis for two years (actually close enough to a large barbecue establishment that my neighborhood was often permeated by the smoke) and there they always put sauce on the sandwich--first the meat, then the sauce, then the coleslaw that has a little mustard in its dressing.   So anyway it didn't occur to me that I would get a sandwich with no sauce--not on the side, either. Coleslaw was just ok, the cabbage should have been cut smaller. The meat--well, at least it was pleasantly free from gristle and excessive fat. But the texture was strange, or maybe I should say lack of texture. The flavor was strange too, as if the not-all-that-apparent smoke flavor was not 100% natural. Overall, it seemed like something that had been on a steam table. Having experienced sandwiches made from chopped-while-you-watch meat--this was not that fresh. In all fairness, I did get it at an off time on a weekday in the off season, but still...) The sandwich came with a LOT of fries which were good but a mite overcooked.  So, probably won't go back to Baby Blues. Haven't gotten to Phoebe's in a while but I've had much better sandwiches from there.   When I was in Memphis I missed hoagies. Here I miss barbecue but then there's porchetta!

"I mean, they really must have to go out of their way to find such surly employees?  I would love to see their want ad:  ""Wanted: Curmudgeonly bagel shop employee, must hate life and schmearing bagels with equal zest.""  That said, I like the lox schmear (the actual lox topped bagelwich commands much too high of a price tag, as Chris B. mentioned) so I go back out of laziness.   If they don't care, I don't care either.  It's a general exchange of apathy.  Be prepared to repeat your order more than once, they did not bother listening the first time, this is a guarantee.  They do have tasty, but pricy, lemonade (this place is nothing if not consistent) and decent bagels and schmears.   I got a banana nut muffin on my last visit though and let me tell you what.  I really baked goods of the banana nut variety, in fact,  I had never met one I didn't like until this muffin.

"Sad to say that my favorite part of the dining experience was checking out the decor of the former Temple. It really is a very warm and inviting place. Great for a date or romantic dinner. The service and food just didn't seem to be up to par. My soup was delivered luke warm. I sent it back and the second try was definitely a little warmer but not hot as I'd expect soup to be. My water glass (very small glass) was always empty - perhaps they should consider larger glasses if staff are too busy to stay on top of that. I wasn't impressed with the bread that the waiters deliver (they place one slice on your plate but I found it unimpressive - similar to something I could buy in the supermarket.) Maybe it would be better if it was served warm? I think I'll be back to try this place out again - but maybe the bar menu next time.

"Steakhouse. You cannot fault a restaurant for being focused, but they should be expert at what they focus upon--steak. The filet was ordered medium rare and arrived scored and hot light pink all the way through. The salad and side were equally sub-par. Decent wine selection though they were out of my first choice.  The food here is passable, though uninspired; but, it's a steakhouse, not a chef driven establishment. No, the real failing here was the service. The table was not cleared and cleaned promptly, the food wasn't served politely or properly. A young man literally dropped my plate in front of me from across the table without saying a word. A modicum of decorum is an absolute requirement for this kind of place, and it was here that Fleming's fell flat.

The ribs were burnt on the outside and a little dry on the inside and just lacked flavor.

"Well this was the closest place from where my car was parked with 55 mins left on my parking space, we decided to eat here. The customer service seemed to be great once we entered, greeted with a smile and seated. Once our waiter came I knew it was the end to that great service. He took the drink orders and disappeared. We had to literally look back at him for him to come and take care of the table. My friend order Alfredo and Parm Chicken, I had the grilled chicken sandwich, and the kids had the cheese pizza (small - which fed 3 children).  The Alfredo was COLD and no FLAVOR. The chicken sandwich had a hard tomatoe in it with a GREEN center and the fries were COLD. The pizza was AMAZING.  NEEDLESS to say we needed his help...again he took FOREVER... We asked to take to a manager twice - when she did come she want to fix the situation her solution was to take the items off the check.

"One my first visit to Juan's, the place was packed, so I ordered a House Rox margarita, and waited for a seat to become available. The House Rox is one of the BEST I've ever had. Once my husband and I were seated, we ordered jerk tofu tacos. Awesome! There are so many vegan and vegetarian options. In addition, my server was lovely!   3- stars deducted -I wasn't a fan of the guac because it was really brown. - We sat under the Prince photo, and the wall was super dirty. In addition, the mask that was over the light fixture had a hole (eyes). Through the eyes, we noticed the thickest dust over the fixtures. I HATE dust especially in an eating establishment.  - On a Sunday night, we decided to do takeout. Hubby placed our orders- black bean, tofu tacos no cheese or sour cream with pineapple salsa. I was on the phone when he placed the order. When he gets home, the tacos were full of cheese and there was regular salsa. I was livid because we don't live anywhere near this location. When we called back, we both spoke to the manager, she said we can come back from Kenner, and she will remake our food and throw in some free salsa and chips. Chips and salsa and a long drive back. She did offer to comp our foods if we kept the food and didn't come back tonight. That was interesting... Why not comp the food tonight? We did get our corrected food and LOTS of salsa.

"My friend and I went for lunch recently on a tuesday. We got there about 20 minutes before they opened and waited outside in the nice patio they have for waiting. This was probably the best part of the restaurant. When 11am finally arrived we headed to the door but to our surprise the doors where still locked, we waited 10 minutes when someone finally came to open the door, other people where waiting as well and they just walked in and started seating themselves. Here is where things got ugly: Us: Should we wait to be seated or seat ourselves? Lady/hostess: Well I'll seat you! but I don't understand why people are coming in if I haven't opened the doors yet! Us: Looking at each other like :WTF? Lady: Rushes to a table and plops the menu's down obviously upset still and walks away. The server came over, took our drink order, we had a pitcher of horchata, that was surprisingly good. When she came back she made some suggestions, we gave her our order, 3 tacos each. Shredded beef was ok, not bad but not the best. Rice and beans where not very good.  Server was nice but she had her cell-phone on her and kept using right after she stepped away from our table.

"With my recent experience, I can understand why the mixed reviews.  I actually never got to eat what I ordered because there was a mix-up in ordering between the wine bar next door and this restaurant.  I waited at least 20 minutes for my blackened fish tacos.  When they arrived, the bill was over $15, 50% more than the fish tacos I ordered.  The waiter wanted payment right away because the restaurant is separate from the wine bar - wholly different owners, in fact.  I understood this but didn't feel I should pay for the error of an incorrect order being put in.  The waiter clearly expected me to pay the extra amount pointing out that the tacos were ""grouper"".  I'm afraid I dug in my heels at this point.  I was hungry but I didn't feel I should pay for whatever mistake was made here.  The grouper tacos weren't even on the wine bar menu so I would assume that this was the fault of the restaurant.  I called the wine bar first and the owner thanked me for letting him know what happened and offered me a free glass of wine on him the next time I come in.  Wowee, do I ever feel welcome there!  Thank you, Brian.  Next, I called the restaurant E & E Stakeout Grill and spoke with the manager.  She explained that the wrong order must have been put in by the wine bar (something not even on their menu?) and that the person who brought my meal was an expediter, not a trained waiter who should have told management right away.  I did get an apology from her but, sorry, to have your food taken away at after putting it in front of you and have to wait for more was too much of an error for me and after thinking it over, I left.  Especially since I took the time to call before writing this review, I think the manager should have done a bit more.  It's usually not so easy to obtain new clients and hundreds of dollars are spent each year by restaurants for this purpose.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they have the food but doesn't have the heart, in this case, the diner's viewpoint to go with it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
Looking forward to a nice meal. Very disappointed in quality of food. My order was not done as requested and had to be returned to be recooked. Asked for more chips and waitress took basket and refilled leaving about 1/2 cup of very small broken pieces in basket. Requested water with extra lemon. Got 1/2 of a very thin slice on side of glass. Glad other reviewers alerted me to this being second restaurant for these people. I will take this into consideration when choosing Mexican food in the future.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"When the food is expensive and the quality is MIA, your dinner isn't going to be good. Yes this place has pretty cool scenery and decorations but the food is so bad that it can't save it from me giving this place a higher rating. I came here to try their Korean bbq after buying a groupon. But don't even come here or even buy the groupon. Trust me, you're not missing out.   I order the galbi which was $40 for only 2 thin bone wraps. I didn't like how the beef was marginated, it had this sour taste which made me think the meat went bad. Go to  a Korean place in Chinatown or k-town but not this place.  Since the galbi was so meager, I needed something else to fill me up so I ordered seafood style soondubu. The soup wasn't bad but it was missing the egg it usually came with. The soup was full of tofu and barely any seafood. The picture in the menu showed clams but I had none in my soup.  I also ordered an appetizer, one of the seafood pancakes. Just like the rest of the foods that were served, the pancake was small and lacked the seafood part of the dish. It was overcompensating the pancake part for missing seafood. It didn't taste bad but it's different from the pancakes I ate before.   The waiters and owners were nice people but they weren't that tentative. Both my drink and my friends drink were empty for a good 20mins before anyone refilled it. It wasn't a busy night either.   Tl;dr: pricy dinner for a bad experience. Dont come.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Went for brunch and made a reservation prior to coming. Waited an hour at home and got there to end up waiting another 45 minutes. The hostess offered to sit a family who came in after us down at tables in the bar area to which they said no, she hostess then asked us to which we agreed and then when the family said they didn't realize it was actual tables and not bar top she proceeded to sit them when they came in after us with no reservation.. she continued to apologize when in reality she had no idea what she was doing. Once we were sat we had multiple waters with hairs in them and on them, on the cups and pitchers. When we got new waters there was still hair on them... long white dog looking hairs. While the waitress was bringing our water she said ""oh let me get another one this looks dirty"".. gross. The utensils were dirty and coffee cups had lipstick stains on them. The food was average at best the only reason I enjoyed it was because by the time we actually got to eat I was too starved not to hate it. It was not worth the money and was not the best I've had. None of the us got our meat cooked like we asked. Everyone wanted medium rare and we all got well done meat. The waitress never came to check on us and ask how we were doing. The sad thing is they didn't even have that many people in the restaurant. We will most definitely not be going back to this dirty establishment. If you're supposed to be known for your meat the least you can do is cook it the way customers asked. Disappointed and grossed out.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Unfortunately, I'm not a 72 year old, uber-fabulous old woman in a Chanel suit, dining with my liver-spotted husband at Chez Leon. I don't come from old money, I still have all my tastebuds. I've read nearly everything Anthony Bourdain has written, and I'm not fooled by Chez Leon. My $12 house champagne cocktail was about 2 oz of dry-ish champagne with a sliced strawberry. My duck a l'orange would have made Eric Ripert set fire to his chef's whites because pseudo-French people are still allowed to make food this boring. My friend's bouillabaisse was so dull I think I remember him yawning a lot during the meal. The bread on the table was probably 3 days old, my rice was undercooked, and the highlight of the meal was slicing my duck and cracking duck jokes in my head.

"I knew from the start that this wasn't your typical authentic taco stand so this review won't bash on that. Being from Mexican decent I'm always curious to find the most ridiculous ""taco."" And oh boy , this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. The restaurant is very neat with every inch of wall covered in art. Don't come here if you're looking to have good conversation without having to yell over the loud music.   To order, you have a sheet to mark the tacos you want to order and after a average wait, your food arrives. Apparently, throwing a salad inside a tortilla is considered a taco in America? TACOS ARE NOT MEANT FOR VEGANS! No offense to anyone who doesn't eat meat, but the whole purpose of a good authentic taco is the meat! NOT ground beef, but spiced and marinated meat.   I ordered their ""traditional"" taco meant to deliver the more authentic flavor and what I got was anything but. The ground beef wasn't seasoned, the tortilla was soggy with the sauce they coated everything with. I was offended...  On a more positive note, the queso dip was very good. I'm a fan of American tacos and many flavors that happen when random ingredients are combined but some of these combinations just don't work. For instance: Jackfruit does not belong in a taco. I'm sure other flavors were delicious but I just didn't order the right ones I guess.   I do want to come back to try the other flavors but the bar will be set very low.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Ambiance: comfortable and cozy little cafe located in an otherwise nondescript strip mall.   The Good: very friendly ownership! Gina was so nice, and if I had the time to speak with her about the food quality I have no doubt she should have tried to make it right in a heartbeat. Service was quick and efficient so that was a plus. The atmosphere is bright and upscale for a daytime-only cafe (but lose the fake flower on the tables....) The Bad: Just ok breakfast food, IMO. The omelet was rubbery and way overcooked; the breakfast potatoes had zero seasoning and nothing going for them in terms of onions or peppers added, they were simply dried up little cubes of starch; coffee was decent but def not a great cup of joe, and no options on flavors, blends, or strengths; jalapeños in my omelet were pickled not fresh (ugh, and a big pet peeve, it's so easy to add fresh diced jalapeños and all the difference in the world). The biscuits and gravy were good, but not the best I've ever eaten. So many reviewers have stated they are outrageously good, but I say not so much.....  I would recommend a keener eye be focused on every meal coming out of the kitchen. I'll try you again in a month.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I feel bad to be the party pooper and give a 2 star for this bar.  But it is exactly as the Yelp sentiment puts it - ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""  The far better experience, in this case, is the Elephant & Castle on Whyte!  The staff don't know much about what's going on.  I was getting a little annoyed with how one of the waiters went on and on, talking about how Pilsner Urquell was only available at the Elephant & Castle (and no other place in Edmonton).  I like Pilsner Urquell but that statement is not only an exaggeration but also a cheap and desperate lie.  It's such a commonly available beer!  Anyway, apart from that I've got to say that I just cannot appreciate the charm of a pub with a patio on the top floor of a mall.  It's bad enough that it's in a mall but what's worse is that almost every shop of the mall closes at 6 in the evening (at least on a Saturday when I was there) and yet there are people hanging out on the top floor patio.  It's a tad awry.   I guess it's nice to get a beer before the movie but personally I'd rather get a beer downstairs, outside the mall at Sherlock Holmes or Moriarty's.  The menu etc. and also the food looks good and of decent quality.

"Went here on Cinco de Mayo with some friends. Sat down, ordered Margaritas and....waited. And waited. And waited. Then our Margaritas came with some chips with salsa (GREAT SALSA! Then we waited more. Then they took our orders. The food came out in a reasonable time and the house-made guac was great (though, for $10, it was a bit of a stretch. They only used one avocado, they just made it in front of you!). I had a wet burrito which was delicious. My girlfriend had enchiladas with risotto which I thought was really good, the risotto wasn't her cup of tea. Our other friend had an appetizer, some home made tortillas with chilis in cheese, something like that. That was damn good.    Then we waited for the check. And waited. And waited. We finally got to pay and leave.   In my opinion, great food and exhaustingly slow service. It was on Cinco de Mayo, but they weren't even that busy. There was a good number of open tables!

Needed to ask multiple times for the same thing before receiving it. I can take inaccuracies from a new employee who might be learning, but no tolerance for attitude.

"Never had an issue with the food here but I am sorry to say that I stopped coming when they moved away from all-you-care-to-eat style.  It was nice as they would charge you one price for several food options.  The owner has always been nice and we enjoyed our interactions with him.  We returned several months ago and they had opted for a individually priced menu and eliminated the additional portions.  Unfortunately the prices stayed the same.  I ordered Chicken Tiki Masala and it was @$17.  The dish was small, did not include Naan, and only came with a small portion of rice.  Add Naan and tip (I drank water) and you're looking at $25 for lunch.  That's steep.  While I have no problems otherwise, I can't in good conscious pay that much when there are cheaper options out there.

"Now that have been a couple of times at a few bagel shops around town, I feel comfortable reviewing this place. Sadly, this one is my least favorites.  The good: Fast service, conveniently located at a busy shopping center. The meh: Very impersonal service, just get in, place your order, get your food and that's it. Not rude but not friendly. Not a smile, not a ""thanks for shopping with us"". Bland. The bad: bagels baked fresh daily? Really? You would not be able to tell. I had the Healthful Morning (egg white scrambled with veggies) in a five seed bagel and coffee. The scramble was plain. I am aware that they are probably trying to keep the calorie count low but that's what herbs and spices are for. The bagel was doughy. The coffee was forgettable.

We ordered drinks and asked for food menus. Food came out quickly, my husband liked his burger, my salad was good but dry, so I asked for another dressing. Sad to say it never came, nor did the bartenders smile or overall demeanor. Plates were placed down roughly and there was never an exact response to our food orders or questions. I ate half my salad because I refused to ask for another dressing, since I seemed to bother the bartender whenever I needed her attention(let me add there were 3-4 other patrons at the bar at this time).  As we went to pay, that's when the bartender finally started talking to us and smiling, it was bizarre.

"Bridget's has the décor, atmosphere and pricing of a center city steak house but that's where the comparison ends. I'm sorry to say that the food doesn't live up to its high price. The portions are ample but I prefer quality over quantity. I have been at Bridget's several times and each time my anticipation disappeared with the first bite.   My most recent visit was on a busy Wednesday night in May 2010. We started off our meal with tempura egg rolls and the tuna duet. These two dishes were recommended by our waitress and were actually fairly appetizing. There were four egg rolls to the order and my friend gave them the thumbs up. I had the tuna duet which was five pieces of seared tuna and a round cake of raw ahi tuna with a mayo dressing. I believe both of these small plates were $15 each.  I ordered the special for my main course. It was a 14oz New York Strip with smashed cheddar potato's with a side of garlic green beans. My friend chose the 24oz Rack of Lamb that had a sauce with a mustard base. I was looking forward to a nice porterhouse but there were only three steaks on the small menu.  Our meals came out promptly and the presentation was very nice. I had ordered my steak medium rare as I don't like to cook the taste out of my meat. Unfortunately it was cooked medium to medium well. The Lamb was very good but at $38 it was not great.   My review might come off harsh but I believe if you are going to charge city prices the food needs to be of the same quality. If my steak had been priced at $15 I would have given it a much higher review (if it was cooked how I requested).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Maybe a caught them on a bad day but I paid $80+ for this and there's no excuses for bad days like this in this economy. They have about 3 or 4 parking spots available (it NOLA).

"A recent whirlwind weekend in Nashville had me looking to book a nicer restaurant to celebrate a dear friend's birthday. A little research and a click of the mouse, and we had reservations at Flyte for which I hoped would be a fabulous meal.  A gal called the day before to confirm our reservations. When I called her back, she was very pleasant and asked if we were celebrating any special occasion. I told her about my friend's birthday and she said, ""If you all drink, we customarily will give a toast of champagne for your party in celebration."" Sign. Me. Up. I couldn't have been happier.  Fast forward to the next evening. We arrived on time for our reservation to a restaurant that was nearly empty. There were a handful of patrons in the bar area and perhaps a third of the tables occupied. At 8 p.m. on a Saturday evening, this had me puzzled. In any event, we were seated right away and excited for our meal.  So we sat. And sat. And sat. For about ten minutes, we sat and waited, unacknowledged. We were chatting with each other, so we didn't realize that time had passed until it had been that long. A server comes over to us and asks to take our drink order. Now, we'd looked online and noticed a rather lovely drink menu, a definite reason we ended up dining there. We asked for the menu. And waited. And waited. Only to receive a beer/wine list.   Sigh. You can see where this is going. We were never brought the drink menu we had noticed online, but they DID appease our request for those cocktails, so there was that. We waited a good 15 minutes for our drinks.  We started with the slow poached egg and pork cheek. The food was off to a good start. We were wildly impressed with the appetizers. Sadly, it went downhill from there. The entrees were not good. The soup trio lacked any real definite flavors (one of them tasted like roux only), the brisket was good, but served on an overly salty risotto. The duck dish was delicious, but the fois gras on top was a poor pairing. Duck tends to be richer and the fois gras came across like a salty blob of fat on the top. It didn't work. The sturgeon was the most praised entree (thank goodness this was the decision of the birthday girl), and was quite good.  Honestly, I don't think I could return. The food, while alright, was entirely overpriced. Service was slow (our waiter was completely sweet and attentive later in the evening, but we still weren't happy) and we never received the promised champagne toast. I so wanted to love the place given its local concept and promising menu, but it just did not deliver. Dropping about $75 a person and leaving disappointed makes me sad.

The bun from my sandwich was soggy, the meat was tough and dry, and the coleslaw dressing covered up any BBQ flavour from the meat. The ""tempura battered"" onion rings tasted like the same cheap frozen crap I might get at a small town hockey rink canteen. Definitely not a good thing.  We ordered the mac'n'cheese rolls which essentially were white pasta in an egg role with no cheese whatsoever. They had no flavour at all. They came with a sauce that wasn't very good which I assume was meant to be the ""cheese"" but ultimately failed to bring any resemblance of mac'n'cheese flavouring to the dish.

"We visited NOLA right after Christmas, but I forgot to do some of my reviews.... And I am so torn on how to best review this place.  First, let me say that breakfast was decent.  I picked this place in order to try the Calas (fried rice ball) and for that it fulfilled it's purpose.    But dinner... OH LORD, PLEASE FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO EAT DINNER.  The service was ok, not as good as the morning... but I ordered the crawfish etouffee and was sooooo sad.  I wasn't aware that there were different ways this dish could be made, so that's the first problem.  A roux can be  (what I thought was traditional) light brown, flour and oil based... or it can be a dark brown/red tomato based roux.  So their roux threw the flavor of the dish off from what I was expecting. Secondly, they serve it with either rice or noodles and the waitress somewhat suggested the noodles, so I figured why not try it.. and they were really just run of the mill spaghetti noodles.  Lastly, the crawfish was the last bit they had (I heard the waitress take someone else's order after ours and say they were out of crawfish) and it was likely cooked the day before, because it was awful.    So my final point is just - eat dinner somewhere else.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We had a short wait for a table and within a few minutes of sitting down, our waiter came over. He took our drink order and returned quite quickly with our drinks. He then took our dinner order and we told him we did not have any silverware. He said he would get it for us, so we waited... and waited. Finally he returned with our soup and salads and we again requested silverware as well as fresh grated cheese.  He apologized  for forgetting the silverware and said he would be right back. He wasn't. We watched him wander around the restaurant until he was out of view. We sat for about 5 minutes while soups got cold waiting for cheese and salads could not be eaten without silverware. Finally, my friend got up and got us silverware himself.  When our waiter came back to the table, he asked ""how is everything?"" we were appalled. We told him we had to get out own forks and never got our cheese. He apologized again and mumbled something about the hostess getting our silverware.  Then our dinner came... because someone other than our waited delivered it. He did swing by and asked if he could get us anything, my friend wanted crushed red pepper. He said, he would bring it right over. He got lost again. Didn't see him again until we were finished eating.  We noticed another employee bussing a table next to us so my friend asked him if he could get us the crushed pepper. He looked at us as if we had 3 heads, asked where our waiter was then refused to get it for us.  Ok, so we didn't get our pepper....well, we also didn't get any more drinks. Our glasses sat empty on the table, sounds of our slurps against the melting ice, a lonely beer glass, empty.  We chose Carrabba's because we wanted a relaxing night out and a good meal. It's not often we can afford to eat out so it's an occasion. It should be a good, stress free, relaxing time.... Not an evening rubbernecking for your waiter, thirsty and frustrated having to get your own silverware.   This was not the first time something like this has happened to us at this Carrabba's. We had a very aloof waiter on our last visit, granted not as bad as our waiter last night. We will not be going back to Carrabba's for a while. Hopefully, in our absence, the staff will get some much needed customer service training.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"My girls and I didn't plan accordingly, so we ended up here for dinner. We placed our order over the phone and was told that it'd be ready in ""a few minutes."" LOL. Is this why it's called Presto? Haha. After about 10 minutes, we went inside to pay, but the food was not ready yet. Seems like the employee accidentally made it seem like the food was going to be reheated.   Customer service was good. The employees were nice and polite. The food, however, was a let down. It's hard to mess up pasta, but ours was less than decent. It was overly greasy -- I could see where the cream and oil were separating; and it was unappetizing to look at. None of us finished our meals, but ended up tossing it. After tax, three bowls of pasta cost us $36. We all agreed that we were willing to pay more for better food. It's a shame, though, because the restaurant was super cute on the inside.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Not bad, just not very good either. Cosi is one of those places I've been to so many times over the years and yet no one experience is significant enough to warrant even much of a review. The food is mediocre (at best sometimes) and the fact that they don't have any table service is both a plus and minus at times. Really, the only reason I bother going here is if I need to meet someone for a quick bite but need it to be more substantial an establishment than the deli for a sub. The salads are wilted and sad most of the time (although huge). The sandwiches are pretty pathetic and waayyyy overpriced for what you get. The only real plus is the squagels (square bagels) but they stop serving those at 11am so I rarely have a chance to get them. Basically, it's a good spot to grab a quick (albeit boring) lunch on Walnut street.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
When this restaurant calls itself the best in Reno it serves as an embarrassment to the city. It's a basic diner with burnt coffee serving eggs in various forms.

"We first tried dinner here and it was lack luster. The food was just boring and not flavored well, the mushroom puff pastry was just not good, I barely ate any of it.  We tried lunch today and I was excited to try some breakfast items since those are usually good bets for vegetarians.  I got the #3 scramble, spinach, red onions, goat cheese ant tomato jam, it's listed as a vegetarian menu item. When it arrived I was dubious of the potatoes, at first I couldn't tell if some things were browned onion or potato bits. Then my husband found huge chunks of bacon in his potatoes so I looked further into mine and found several large bacon chunks.  I had already eaten a couple of potatoes which grosses me out since I've been vegetarian my whole life, I doubt I ate any big pieces of bacon but I ate stuff cooked with bacon, totally not cool. Our waitress came over and said there shouldn't be bacon in the potatoes but when I showed her she said the bacon must have just crossed over... Umm are they just cooking everything on a huge flat top grill?!? If so that means basically everything is all cooked together which if you have any dietary concerns is a big no no. They did remake my food with potatoes that didn't have bacon... At least not that I could see! The potatoes themselves were just not good. Too much seasoning and some were way tough and dried out.  The scramble itself was ok, but it's more of a layered on your plate dish, not a scramble. Nothing is cooked or scrambled with the eggs.   Sadly I doubt we will be going back even though it's within walking distance of our house.   Get your stuff together and teach your kitchen staff how to cook with out potentially making your customers sick!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"So just went to eat here yesterday for a special occasion with a friend.  We were seated promptly and filled out our menu for the AYCE for sushi.  This was the beginning of the end.  First the waitress brings us each a small portion of chopped cucumber and ONE small portion of wasabi and ginger.  I said we need another one as there is two of us.  She looked dumbfounded.  Then our sushi comes and it is not small, it is child sized, almost ridiculously small.  Highlighted in yellow at the top of the sushi sheet it says they will charge 50 cents for each thing of rice or sushi not eaten.  It is $17.95 pp for lunch and $22.95 for dinner.  The unagi we received  were literally 1.5 inches or smaller.  We each got ONE order.  You can not order more than one order pp of unagi for the AYCE.  This is the stupidest thing I have seen!  NO other sushi restaurant in Reno has that policy.  The Ikura came and each roll was the size of my thumb (10 eggs on each one).  Are they afraid you might want to feel full when you leave?  It took 3 attempts and almost 10 minutes to get a waitress to bring us a second AYCE Sushi order sheet so we could get more food.  They kept walking by us, but never asked if we needed anything or if the food was ok....  Lousy.  Desserts are also One per customer.  I ordered the mochi ice cream.  It came and was almost liquid, had to be sitting out for quite some time.  The waitress acted annoyed when I asked for a new FROZEN ice cream.  I have had great service at IJJI Sushi and plan to take my friends there from now on.  I don't get what the hype is about this place, but I wouldn't recommend Hiroba Sushi!

"Let me get straight to the point. If you are not an Oyster lover, I repeat, if you are not an oyster lover, keep walking by this restaurant. The city has so many other places to try. During the Christmas holidays, my family and friends were in town and decided to conquer the French Quarter. Most of them coming from Atlanta, somehow love oysters and out voted me and decided to eat here. As we were seated, I looked over the menu and noticed that they did not have an extensive collection so I basically stuck to what I knew--Crawfish etoufee. However, there crawfish etoufee came with a twist, it included fried tails as well. It took only about 20 minutes to receive our orders, we were a table of 10, so that wasn't usual. Once I ate a spoonful of the etoufee my face soured. The fried tales were extra crunchy and did not compliment the base, not even with Tabasco. For New Orleans, this was far from authentic and I expected so much more from them. Others around the table enjoyed their oysters, but many were displeased with the fried fish platter. Felling redeemed, since I wasn't the only one with a complaint, I tried a taste of fish and immediately had to take a swig of water to wash it down. Most places that serve fish, serve it fresh, but they also have an exclusive batter that compliments the fish they serve. Felix's is different, what you get is fresh bland fish and that is about it. I love the culinary scene in New Orleans but I can definitely scratch Felix's Restaurant off of my growoing list of places to dine before I die.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Kaisen Sushi seems to be very highly recommended on Yelp so I was really excited when my friends and I finally made it there, but I was a little disappointed when I finally got my sushi after the wait.   I ordered their California Roll with imitation crab, it wasn't very delectable and when I dipped it in the soy sauce it tasted worse. I ended up giving away my Spider Roll to my friends because I didn't like it at all.  I also had their Sylvia's Special which is like a salmon & cream cheese Roll with green onions. Not a nice complement, their green onions didn't add flavor and the salmon a big disappointment because I almost always love salmon rolls at sushi restaurants.  I had their fried calamari as well, which was okay, but after a few bites I found myself not wanting much more and ended up giving that way too. Service was on-par, food came little by little but not too slowly. Overall it was alright...I had a few things that were not good and a few things that were average, but I'd rather spend my money somewhere else.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Going down hill.  When my family first tried this place it was awesome.  The prices were always on the hefty side.  It's hard to pay about 30 bucks for 2 burgers a fries but we figured to hell with it because its good food.  Then more and more it became not worth the price.  I always get the same thing.  Cyclops burger cooked medium.  They really need to figure out their timing.  Maybe twice has my burger been cooked to medium.  It's either completely cooked or raw. I just ordered food from here a few days ago for pickup.  I got the cyclops burger, and a bacon cheese burger both cooked to medium.  One burger was on the medium side, the other was raw.  It doesn't make sense to have one be raw in the same order.  The bacon on both burgers were under cooked.  It was rubbery.  My cyclops burger also had no egg.  That's what makes it a cyclops burger.    Also, to the owners, I recommend you let people who are coming in for a pick up to pay while they wait.  Anytime I come for pick up I can't pay until my food is finished and then my food is stuck just sitting on the counter because I haven't paid yet and now I'm waiting in the line of other people paying or placing orders.  By the time I pay, my food has been sitting there for 10 minutes or more.  Then by the time I get home, the food is almost cold and the fries are soft from steaming in the bag.  We have come back multiple times hoping for the off chance it's good again but we just can't bring ourselves to keep throwing away over 30 bucks on food that just ends up being disappointing.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The quality of the food just didn't impress me: a lot of the food was just plain salty. Out of the buffet the only thing I liked was the tandoori wings. I'm not sure if this was just because it was a busy day (Father's Day) or if it's a regular issue. The layout of the store is good and it does have potential I just think the Buffett should have better food. Didn't like the tikka chicken nor the chilli beef. A lot of the food was watered down yet very salty. I also think Naan should be at the buffet table itself so that the waiter doesn't have to bring it to the table each time. Desserts there were ok but the mango based desserts were a bit too tart (should be smoother). I suggest adding coconut milk or oil to dishes so everything tastes smoother and consistent. The owners seem like nice people and the place has potential I want this review to be just constructive criticism I believe you guys can improve. I do remember the restaurant under previous owners about 10 years ago and the food was better back then.

The beer selection was good (a little pricey!) and the live music was fine, but the awful service really ruined the evening for most of us.  Each of us felt that we had to leap out of our seats to get the waiter's attention, and we literally found ourselves waiting a table full of empty glasses and bottles for most of the night.  Brandt's would have definitely made at least three times as much on us if we had been offered more.  When the bill came, we realized why service might have been so crappy-- a big fat 18% added service charge on top of the bill.  With that and tax, my single $5.50 beer came out to $6.99.  Bad taste in my mouth after this last visit.  It's two stars for you, Brandt's.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"What a disappointment :( We came here because of a recommendation and all of the highly rated reviews on Yelp and boy, were we surprised. For starters, we ordered the crab claws appetizer, which we assumed were normal sized crab claws since there was no description in the menu, and at $15 we never expected to get what we got - teeny, tiny 2 inch baby blue crab claws that weren't even in season. Oh, and they were SWIMMING in grease. We opted to not have them fried but I do believe frying is the cooking method of choice for this restaurant.  EVERYTHING else was fried, sans seasoning.  After our crab claw debacle we each ordered the seafood platter. We each received a plate of fried oysters, shrimp and catfish with zero seasoning, on top of a bed of fat, greasy french fries. Just batter and lard, nothing else. Now, I don't know about you but I prefer that my cholesterol and gazillion calories have flavor. Otherwise, what's the point? The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because the food didn't make us sick.

"It was a little bit of a let down coming to this location of the Cheesecake Factory. We sat on the patio, which is beautiful with a lovely waterfall. Fans and birds chirping. The server Josh was great and had to deal with things that were out of control. I just think that the servers aren't taught properly how to address a table. They seem to start talking when they are 8 feet away, which is weird for the people sitting at the table because you're not sure if they are talking to you or the people near you or themselves. This may be me nitpicking on quality of service but there are some social expectations I have when having a server. Just plant your feet at the head of the table before you speak it shows respect and professionalism.   Another issue I had was when my husband and I finally got our food because it did take awhile. The salad lettuce was wilted to the point where I did not want to eat it. It should have been thrown away. Some of it was brown and soggy. Gross! and on top of it, there was a long blonde hair in it.  Luckily, the sandwich was good (overpriced) but good.  I let our server Josh know about the hair and he was mortified. The manager did come over (started talking from 8ft away) did not introduce herself, but did take care of the issue by offering me another which I declined and gave us the sandwich and a piece of cheesecake complimentary. She did the right thing and I appreciate it.

"The food is pretty good, drinks & wine list are decent, atmosphere is okay, and the service speed is always bad.  I honestly don't think I will ever eat here again after consistent LONG wait times for food which is basically street food and should be one of the quicker things you can put out from a kitchen.  On a recent visit I walked in looking to order takeout (they generally don't take orders over the phone) and sit at the bar for a drink while I waited - except that I was told the wait for food would be 60-90 minutes.  Really??  For a restaurant that was no more than 3/4 full?  I understand you may have chosen to seat 30 people at once but even then does it really take you 90 minutes to make 30 arepas?  Apparently the answer is yes because they can only cook 8 arepas at a time and this takes 20 minutes - sucks to be you if you're there on a full night when they've got 40-50 people ordering arepas and your ""casual"" dinner takes 2 hours.  I was hoping that the early issues of this restaurant would subside over time but nothing has really changed. The food is still generally good but the cocktails are not all that great and the service is hit or miss while the wait times for food almost always border on ridiculous.  Honestly I'd rather patronize someplace that wants my money, maybe they're making plenty here already but it seems like they could easily be doing 50+% more covers on any given night and not make me wait 45-60+ minutes on each visit for an arepa - this is why they always tell you that you should order an appetizer, in addition to making more money!  It's a shame, because the food is quite good and I'd love to have a nice neighborhood option but they seem to want to run this place as fine dining where 2 hours would be normal rather than a neighborhood joint which is more in line with the decor and food but where people don't typically want to spend all night in the restaurant.  Certainly Mais Arepas can run their restaurant however they want but just know the deal before you go or you'll end up like a lot of people I've seen in the restaurant who are unhappy and trying to scarf down their food once it finally comes because they didn't have all night to spend at dinner.

"Thank goodness the food was pretty good because I've never been treated so rudely by staff - not just the person at the counter but then when I seemed a little stunned by the treatment I was getting by the person taking my order, but also one of the line cooks chimed in. The situation was I was having trouble figuring out which one to choose - it was my first time and I was starved - BUT - I was dying to use the restroom which seemed to be a really BIG ISSUE because I hadn't yet placed my order and they have a policy of customers only for use of the facilities. Now I can understand this, but I had been there a good 5 minutes contemplating the menu and said it was my first time and there were so many choices which looked interesting. When the line cook chimed in that it was the store policy I was stunned - so I pulled out a $10 bill out of my wallet, handed it to the cashier, proceeded to use the restroom and returned to complete placement of my order. Frankly I didn't want to rush my selection - and yes, I really had to go. Anway - long story short is thank goodness the food was good - I have to give them that - but it still has left a bad impression on me - and to think I had been looking forward to trying out this place. I could see one associate being in a bad mood - I've had my share of bad days too - but to have 2 associates giving me a hard time leads me to think it's from the top down. Management should take responsibility for this and really work to train the staff on how to create a welcoming environment for the patrons. It may not be a top dollar expensive restaurant but it's also not cheap either - and I was contemplating trying the most expensive dish on the menu (Lobster mac-n-cheese $11) but I was so put off by the service I chose something safer and less expensive. Anyway - I hope someone reads this because they need to work on it.  Kenneth",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I drove by this place for months waiting for it to open, and made it my first stop after being away for 2 months. It was only open for a week or two at that point, so my expectations were low as there would inevitably be bugs they were still working out. I pulled up to a full parking lot, and the line about 8 deep, which gave me plenty of time to study the large menu. On my first visit, I decided to order 1 absolutely plain cheeseburger as a baseline, and one of their specialty burgers, in this case, the bullseye bbq burger. They didn't ask me how I wanted the burgers cooked, so I asked the cashier if I could have them both medium. She said no, all burgers are cooked well - a sure sign this was going to suck.  Despite how busy it was, I got my burgers relatively quick. The presentation looked neat and the burgers looked fairly big, however, most of the girth was due to the bun. I really liked the buns they use here... Kinda like a challah / deli roll hybrid. I bit into the plain cheeseburger first to establish my baseline, and wham! Grey meat. The kiss of death for a burger joint. I can't stand overcooked burgers, but if you like'em well done you'll probably like 25. Don't get me wrong, the first burger was acceptable, but really a let down considering how excited I was about this place. But I trudged on, digging into my bbq burger. It, like my other burger, was overcooked and dry. On top of that, it had onion straws right out of the can, which were also very dry. Something this dry calls for lots of cheese and/or sauce, but to my dismay there was hardly any bbq sauce on it. All in all, a disappointing experience.   Being the reasonable guy that I am, I decidied to give 25 another chance. So I waited 2 weeks, and went back after the lunch time rush. This time, I went for the burger of the month, which had Bacon and a fried egg on it, and again settled on the bbq burger. Sadly, these would be my last burgers I ever ordered at 25. My order was up and as I unwrapped my first burger, I see its covered with lettuce and slathered with mayo. Who the hell put that on top of a burger w/ fried egg on it? Do you make breakfast w/ lettuce and mayo? No biggie right? I'll just scrape it off. That's when I found my burger patty absolutely charred to death. It looked like it had been pulled from a burning building. And despite the fact I had a gooey egg yolk to moisten things up, there was no saving this burger. I begrudgingly ate it anyway, taking frequent sips of my soda so I didn't choke. I decided to examine my bbq burger before I bit into it, and it was burned to a crisp as well. Do these guys think this is funny? Was I being punked? Ashton, wheres the camera? Nope, just business as usual at 25, where they take frozen patties and mash the Hell outta them on a flat top that's turned up entirely too high. How can you run a burger joint when you can't even cook a burger?!?! This should be your core competency.   I really wanted to like this place. I tried to be fair. Maybe its me... Maybe I'm spoiled because I've had burgers from some of the best joints all over the country. Maybe my expectatons are too high for a place in west deptford. Let me tell you something, when a restaurant talks a big game, I expect results. Lousy execution closes restaurants all the time.   If you settle for mediocrity, or only eat your beef well done, eat at 25. But if you're a burger aficianado, steer clear. 2 stars because l like the buns and creative burger options, and frankly that's generous.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

My dish was nothing to write home about and the Mahi Mahi was too salty. Salad was not entirely fresh. I think The Olive Garden is a better deal (not that I would go there either). So in conclusion nice ambience but the food was dissapointing. 3.5$ for beer on tap was good.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"While the take out service was fine, I didn't think the food was very good. I simply didn't enjoy my dish of pork lo mein. The noodles were over cooked and the flavor was off.

We were almost never approached unless we tried to flag our waitress down and even then, that was a challenge.

Mediocre at best. The workers made the process 10x more difficult for themselves. I had to repeat myself multiple times because the guy was not paying attention. Their main objective here was to take the order and get customers out the door. The customer service needs a lot of work. But on the plus side I was pleasantly surprised by their wrap. The southwest chipotle steak wrap was better than expected! It was a meaty wrap with good seasoning! The proportion was also very filling!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"NO NO NO NO NO  Yelp failed me. Visited SB for my birthday weekend and stayed at El Encanto (which was a tragedy inofitself and I will be reviewing shortly), so I was hoping for some redemption via sushi. Please refer to my title -- 'sushi elitist.' There's a few things I can forgive, but trumped up sushi places serving icky fish are not one of them so I'm gonna slam this place hard because of how misled I ended up feeling.  Someone here said this is a gem in SB -- I'd really hate to see what the unpolished sushi joints in SB serve, because the experience here blew donkey balls, pardon my French.  Here's why:  - Tuna poke...lol. More like plate full of pretentious vegetables covered with dressing and three slices of whatever quality tuna. And for $12...come on; first off, poke is usually served over rice and is cubed, not sliced. Second...well, at least make it taste good. I felt like I was eating a garden salad with balsamic vinegrette and Starkist tuna slices - Tuna and salmon sushi were like, whatever. I've had better at mom and pop joints. Nothing special and slices were pretty small for what you're paying for. Unagi was gummy and warm in some spots, cold in others -- absolute worst unagi I've ever tasted and could easily make better unagi just buying the frozen filets at the local Japanese market and serving them over rice  I dunno, I was so underwhelmed by the menu thus far I gave up and just stopped ordering because I felt cheated; usually at a good sushi joint I can keep packing it away if it's good to excellent. Instead, I halted the wasting of fish and drank a Cherry Coke and ate fruit Mentos back in the hotel room (and was miles better, btw). I'm rather appalled at how this place can have 4 stars overall, but I guess us LA folk are fortunate to have legit sushi options. SB peeps -- when you come out to LA, you'll understand.   +1 star for a nice and attentive Japanese waitress. It was also rather annoying that we happened to get seated upstairs next to a quartet of ex-frat boys exchanging loud anecdotes about banging chicks and spending ridic amounts of money. Not docking for that, but when a place attracts that kind of clientele...well, it doesn't reflect well on the establishment.  Sorry, but unless we happened to get served the absolute bottom of the barrel quality (which I doubt), people giving this place anything more than 3 stars don't know what real sushi is. If Arigato can't get the basics right, I'd hate to try their more exotic dishes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"My two companions and I decided on Frenchy's for dinner after asking several people on the street to recommend a good place to eat in Clearwater. We arrived around 6PM, just in time to secure one of four tables with accompanying benches squished together along a short wall. Across a narrow aisle were 4 booths. A small, busy, bar with stools was situated on the other side of the short wall. Zero room to move caused a man and his son to continually elbow me in the back. The elbowing continued with the next patrons to occupy the benches behind me. 22 people crammed in to approximately a 12 x 15 foot area with booths and tables was brutal. The noise was prohibitive. At times we could not hear each other talk and so we did not. We shared a fish spread which was basically a take on tuna salad. Bad move to serve it with cellophane wrapped crackers.Two of us had the grilled grouper sandwich, another had the mahi sandwich. All sandwiches were housed in a plain onion bun. Visions of juicy tomatoes, crisp lettuce and a thick slice of cheese as filling for the fish flew out the window when we saw a few strands of lettuce, one thin tomato and a small white chewy chunk which we assumed was the cheese. The fish was  a good size, cooked perfectly, and was very good. My companion said the mani was 'meh.' An order of hush puppies was soaked right through with grease. Yikes. One companion ordered key lime pie which we all tasted. An unadorned piece of pie on a plate was a bit soft for key lime pie, but okay. Being packed in to a space like a sardine, over the top noise, and poor food made this a disappointing experience. We were all relieved to get out of the place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Deanie's is a bar and restaurant. It offers mediocre shrimp and poor oysters. Actually, it was hard to find an oyster in what was really just oyster-flavored, deep-fried dough. One order of fish was mediocre, the other wasn't thoroughly cooked. The french fries were OK but the beer selection was both limited and mediocre.

"Over rated.   Came here with reservations for Reveillion Dinner on Christmas Eve with the family. All decided on the same. The meal started off with turtle soup. The soup was brought out cold for all four of us, so we had to send them all back to be reheated. The next course, oysters, were the only good thing that no one had a problem with. The main course was gulf fish over an uncooked watery risotto. Dessert was unspectacular as well with an egg nog ice cream.   The only reason they got 2 stars was because our server was a rockstar, though he had to spend time apologizing for the kitchens screw ups.

"New to area and always try to support local businesses.  Unfortunately, I won't be back.  The Good?  Waitress was friendly.  The sausage and sauerkraut on the Wed. buffet was good.  The Bad?  Many of the tables are uneven and have coasters stuffed under them to balance the tables.  The food on the buffet was lukewarm at best.  There were very few ""sides"" that were actually German.  The only one I considered to be German was the potato salad and I swear the sliced potatoes came out of a can.  The bread was not fresh baked.  It could have come from Aldi's.  The decor, I'm guessing, hasn't changed since it opened.  Overall, really disappointed as my ancestors came from Germany and I thought I was going to get authentic German food.

"We have tried this location twice and both times the server was incredibly rude.  This last time the guy yelled at me, my daughter, and actually chitised my son (grown man) for walking to the bar and ordering a drink.  The bartender even was rude, just pouring the drinks he got for his brother and himself and just shoving across the bar.  The only reason this is not one star is the fact that the burgers were good, as were the sides, but the sides were quite small for the price.

as I was ordering my boil bag I was talking about how I've been to a different crab du jour and location and it came out perfect then I tried a different place that was not associated with the name and it came with no Cajun spices or spice all together. So I ordered the bag the way I would order it at the other crab du jour. Base of garlic butter and mild spices... ( not NO spice) the young gentleman who was just a nice person was telling me that I would get a mild spice in my bag and was wicked cool no complaints on his end until I received my boil bag I brought it home and there was not a lick of spice anywhere in the bag.  So I called up and I asked how did I not order this correctly because now I feel it's on me cuz two out of four boil bags didn't come with spice even though I order them the same way.  So now he's definitely try to put it on me saying I didn't order correctly that I needed to order it some certain way and I basically said then why didn't you tell me that when I was ordering the boil bag and then he tried blaming the kitchen....  Highly disappointed I felt the serving size was very small compared to the boil bag that I got from the other location of Crab du jour.  The corn also doesn't taste like it's fresh corn it tastes like it was one of those frozen corns which is disgusting.  Also I received a free order of fries which were also soggy and I legit stayed five minutes from the location.  They also didn't put utensils and the bag which is highly disappointing as well....,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Oh, the reviews have been a flyin' lately for Cin Cin, and since it's in my hood I'll chime in and add my two cents worth. Yes, I am one of those aforementioned suburbanites who drive a luxury SUV and I am proud of it. I did my time in Brooklyn and Philly and now I'm reaping the rewards of selling out to the man professionally (pre-Yelp, of course) and saving my pennies along with my dude. Yeah me! Guess that makes me a yipster - I'll keep rocking my tattoos and purple hair while driving my kids around in the BMW as long as I can possibly afford it. Luckily, I'm neither foolish or into mediocracy, so I take no offense to Eric's review (love you, mister!)  :)  Now that I've gotten that off my chest, I'll talk about Cin Cin. It's pretty, and pretty expensive, too, which is why I get my Chinese fix from Lucky Star in Roxborough when I don't need delivery. Cin Cin's cuisine is supposed to be fancypants, but to me it tastes pretty average. One time I ate there for lunch with some girlfriends and the staff were super jerky, from the hostess to the waitress to the guy pouring the water. My usual fare of wonton soup and beef with broccoli was just ehhh - and the bad service really bummed me out.  If you need to eat Chinese food in an upscale environment, then this is an obvious choice. If you care about the food you're stuffing down your piehole, go somewhere else (the Lucky Star peeps are waiting just about 8 minutes down the road with open arms AND free calendars for New Years)!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

This is a Buffett after all so I guess I shouldn't expect much. But I really wanted to like this place. I've been here 3 times and I should have stopped after the first visit. The food is not good.

"Go-gos is usually my go to Greek restaurant but after recently moving to this side of town, I was happy to know that there was another Greek restaurant near by. That happiness was shortly followed by disappointment. I had the chicken and steak rice bowl combo. It sounded really good until I realized I paid $12 for a meal that looked like it was designed for a 3 year old. The chicken and steak were good but the portions were really tiny and the rice was the blandest thing I've ever had in my life. Thank God for hot sauce because that was the only flavor that rice had. My boyfriend had a pita wrap he was semi happy with and if it wasn't for the chicken and lemon soup I had on the side, I would've walked out still hungry. The soup was the best part of the meal actually. Point is, it was a waste of my money. I'd rather make the drive to Go-gos",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I went to Proof for the 2nd time. Actually my 1st experience was positive. After walking 5 miles on the Rillito River path I thought it would be great to have a beer and pizza / salad. They were not busy at all and after waiting approximately 25 minutes for my pizza it was explained to me that they gave my pizza to another table and had to recook my pizza . They than came out with my salad which was quite small and had no dressing on it.

"The first time I EVER went to Nello's was the one in St. Albert about 8 years ago.  I ordered the Spaghetti alla Carbonara.  I got burnt scrambled eggs in spaghetti.  I remember and will ALWAYS remember this....  So, here we went, just this past Friday evening, 8 years later to the NEW location to see if anyone has learned to make Spaghetti alla Carbonara.  First off, if you aren't familiar with the location, you do need to ""hunt and peck"" for it a bit as it is situated around the corner of the first series of businesses of the stripmall there.  Parking isn't the best by the restaurant, but you have a large parking area beyond the location of the restaurant.  You can't tell what it looks like from the outside, so once I got in I was surprised at how sparse it seemed.  All I remember is the beige walls....the lighting is not great and the way tables are set in the section where the door is aren't the best.  On the other side of the partition it is a little ocean of tables...not very ""cozy"" feeling, I am afraid.  On a positive note, the noise level is reasonable and people are there chatting it up and seemingly enjoying their time together.  Our waiter was quite nice and we found out that the original owner, ""Nello"" sold the business to his son and with a partner operate both locations.  The partner operates this one, the son operates the original location in St. Albert.  He was quite nice as he shook our hand when we left and while we were at our table came over to greet us and ask how our meal was.   And in fact, to OUR meal.  LOTS of stuff on the menu .... In fact, so much that it made it a bit overwhelming to choose.  Lucky me though since my goal was clear....see if someone figured out how to make Spaghetti alla Carbonara.  For an appetizer, we both ordered the Insalata di Broccoli (VERY garlicky--so much so that it hide the taste of the broccoli, however, to its credit, they serve it with a lemon wedge which given how they make it, tasted better with the addition).  So, onto the Spaghetti alla Carbonara.  So, it wasn't burnt scrambled eggs, however, it was WAY too creamy and cheesy....as well, the portion was enough for 3 people.  As well, it was a bit overcooked.  My companion ordered the Pasticcio Gigi and though it wasn't overcooked, it was way too cheesy and not so much sauce....in fact, he kept saying that it seemed that it was cooked/baked in an individual skillet and then dished. Pasticcio should be cut and dished almost like Lasagne (alla Calabrese).  Dessert was Tiramisu' for me, and Gelato al Bacio for my companion.  Both were fine (the gelato was pre confectioned), the tiramisu' ""homemade"".....MUCH better than the one I had at Allegro.  Is it the BEST place in Edmonton?  CERTAINLY not.....is it the worst?  No.  However, this being said, for me....I won't be hiking up Calgary Trail to return....even if they didn't burn the eggs in the Carbonara ;-)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I was the only African American women waiting and she refused to take my tip. I never felt so disrespected in a restaurant in Philadelphia.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"So I made it a point to come down and get a po boy after visiting a local convention, and given the history and reviews this place has, I had high hopes to go to po boy heaven after my first bite.   What I got was a pretty bland experience overall. The line that day was long but was expected for a weekend, but even so it was very slow moving and the register broke down two customers ahead of me which made things worse. This did give me more time to decide on my order, which was the classic shrimp po boy, a cookie, and a drink. Restaurant was mostly packed which got my excitement up.   Food came out quick. The sandwich though was a total letdown. Dry and lacked flavor. It was packed to the brim with shrimp so the value was there, but this (and all the breading the shrimp had) probably added to the dryness overall. The shrimp was under-seasoned and tasted like plain, unsalted shrimp. The cookie was better than the sandwich but the next time (if there is one) I'd skip that too...nothing to write home about. I choked down my sandwich with my drink and had to get a second drink to make me feel better after that....not really a good experience for the ""original"" po boy restaurant.   My next trip down to Louisiana, I'll try another place and compare. This was reminiscent of my trip to Philly, trying Pat's and Geno's for the first time and being shocked when they compared to the cheesesteaks at the local mall instead of being that authentic, awesome experience everyone raves about.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"After all the great reviews, I decided to check it out. Almost everyone there that night was korean. I'm chinese and my boyfriend is white american. We sat down and they decided to wait on all the koreans and us last. We were very polite and waited. We waited probably about 15 minutes before they even started our coal and fire/grill. I've had korean bbq a lot, in california, texas but this was definitely one of the worst experiences. When I asked the waiter how much the cost would be he said, maybe around 32 dollars. Even though most reviews say 25-30 dollars. I said ok well hopefully the meat will be worth it.   Service was horrible through out the night, meat was great though, still not the best but it was good for the philly area. Everything was dirty, bathrooms were dirty, you can tell the ceiling is rotting. I work in the hospitality industry so I know the guidelines that a restaurant needs. In the end, when we went to go pay, she charged us 70 dollars for 2 people. We only had the buffet, we didn't have any soft drinks or anything added on. I feel like she (the old lady) ripped us off.   I think they need a sign that says a set price.   Good luck with your experience!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This place has decent food but the service is absolutely awful. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant and it took us over an hour to get our food. The only thing that came out quickly were the oysters which were the highlight of the dinner. The quality of food is not worth the service. Can't imagine how bad the service would be if this place was busy, although there is probably a reason it wasn't. 4-5 stars for the cocktails and the oysters but everything else makes it a 2.

"This was a try-once-and-move-on deal for me.  There are just too many burger joints in the city to accept mediocrity.  Lets start by saying the place has a decent burger-joint vibe, complete with old-school video game console.  The service was decent and it has all the staples you look for in a burger joint; all different kids of burgers prepared all different ways with handmade milkshakes.  I love a milkshake-burger combo with some decent ingredients, i.e., not mcD's.  Now for my cons:  My burger was supposed to be medium, however, it was as well done as well done could be- completely drying it out.  The bun was horrible.  I want to taste my burger, not some gigantic piece of bread.  To make matters worse, it was on the verge of being stale.. ya know what I'm talking about, its a touch hard and crumbly yet still just acceptable for a place to use- i hate that.  Lastly, my poor fries, the thinnest weakest part of the meal, were so rock hard it was like eating hard pretzels.  I may at some point give these guys another shot if I start hearing good thing, but for now Im going to wait.. sucks, bc they have a great idea with no other burger joints on passyunk.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This used to be my favorite sushi place in town because of the late hours but after this last experience I'm not planning on going back. It's normally busy on the weekends because they are one of the few places open late and I completely understand that they're busy. My friends and I waited a few minutes to be seated it was somewhat busy but that was no big deal. We get seated and it's in the corner back. This has to be the worst seating in the whole restaurant there were fruit flies all around the table and we were getting ignored all night. I had to get up a few times, the first to get us some napkins, the second time to serve myself some siracha and the final time to pay for the meal. The waitress forgot one of our rolls and did not arrive until we had finished our other rolls. One of the meals came with mochi ice cream and we sat and waited for a good while until finally I grew tired and went to the front to pay the bill. The owner was there and seemed annoyed that I came up to pay. The waitress then came over and pulled up the bill and handed at me. The owner did not speak to me and just took my payment and handed me back my receipt. While I was doing this the waitress went back to the table having completely forgotten the mochi and which flavor my friend chose. Luckily that time the waitress was able to give the ice cream to her right away. I used to frequent this restaurant once a week but now I don't think I'll be going back.

My mojito was tart and bitter with no sign of sweetness. The food was beyond over priced. For $16 i got 3 poorly rationed fried fish tacos. The fish was cooked to perfection, but they gave you 1 tiny ass piece per taco with maybe a tbsp of pico!  Besides the poverty tacos, the dish came with no sides! No rice, no beans, no nothing!!!

This is not right. I understand waiting a few minutes to be fresh. The last time I picked up an order there seemed to be quite a bit of confusion as well. It would behoove the managers to refine the online/ phone ordering process so that it runs more smoothly. This restaurant is a bit more expensive and the quality reflects that usually. Also, the order was already paid for which should be clear and it was $37 online and they tried to charge $25 in person (I don't know if they had the wrong Order or if this was in addition) The food was sub par and we had to reheat it because it had been sitting there for so long.

When I got the bill, not only was I charged for the chicken I didn't eat but also the pancakes. Really? You don't even stand by your food at all?

"We booked this as a Priceline express deal for $55/night. It's listed as 3.5 stars but that's definitely a stretch. I'd say this is 2.5 or 3 stars at the most.   At check-in I was given a key to another guest's room. I opened the door to see their belongings strewn across the room and returned to the front desk. The clerk indicated that she wasn't wearing her glasses and misread the number.. To my knowledge no one was given a key to our room.  The AC in our room never cooled the room below 75-80 degrees. We even asked them to send the engineer the first night and he claims to have adjusted something but it still didn't cool much. I had to take two showers the first night - one when we arrived after camping in the Grand Canyon for three nights, then a second after doing laundry and getting settled because I got sweaty again and couldn't cool down because of the AC. Since switching hotels the contrast between air conditioning that works and doesn't was dramatic.   The furniture is dated and worn. The TV in the living room is an old big box TV. The aspect ratio was off (set for wide screen on a standard screen), but since they don't supply the manufacturer remote I couldn't fix it. Mildly annoying but we didn't spend a lot of time in the room watching TV.   The sleep number beds aren't as nice as I expected. The good news is we were considering either sleep number or tempurpedic at home and this helped swing the vote. The air pumps are loud. The remote was not very responsive, it took hard press holding of the buttons to get results. Sometimes we had to do it several times before the bed responded. It was comfortable enough to sleep but not the heavenly experience I expected.   The bathroom is visibly worn.

"We've always loved The Cheesecake Factory and always seem to find one when we're traveling. Recently, this one opened in Reno, where we live, and we were excited. We knew there would be a long wait. There always seems to be a wait at any Cheesecake Factory location.  We were quoted a 60-80 minute wait when we got to this location. I took one look around and saw that this location is TINY...and horribly cramped! Now why in the world, in a tourist city near Lake Tahoe, would they build such a tiny location? Granted the mall might regulate it, but then build somewhere else!  As we left to go into the mall to shop, I immediately noticed there are not near enough seats for people waiting. People were standing in or very near the dining area, which is highly inappropriate.  The food was great as always, but we kept having to wait exceptionally long for drink refills. They had one person on either end of the dining area overlooking the area, presumably to assist with anything as needed, but they never refilled drinks. One of them, obviously an idiot who has no sense of personal space, kept walking by our bar style table and getting too close. It's hard to explain, but whenever she walked by our table, she looked right at us, like she was worried we were going to steal something. At one moment, I thought she was going to kiss me LoL  I understand this is a very new location, but it was not planned out well at all. They are going to lose money because people don't like long waits, and that will continue until people just stop showing up. This location should have been three times the size it is, and they should utilize their staff appropriately and train them on manners.

"A real shame.  The Good Pie was my favorite restaurant in St. Louis back when they were on Olive.  My Mom says that now they are going to have to change their name to The No Good Pie.    I went with a group of 6, which I guess was our first mistake.  They can only cook 1-2 pizzas at a time, so by the time the entire table had been served, the first 2 people served had cold, rubbery pizzas.  The first 2 pizzas sat on a counter outside of the oven for quite some time before the staff just decided to bring them to us.  I still thought it tasted good, but would have been much better hot.    The lunch menu has changed; no longer is it a pizza+salad on 1 large tray - pizzas and salads are separate, but each are bigger now.  The worst thing about this was that they didn't have the delicious Mixed Greens salad (with gorgonzola and apple) on the lunch menu.  I asked if I could still order a Mixed Greens salad, and they said they could make it, which was really nice of them.  Unfortunately, they brought me a large bowl of the Arugula salad, which I did not enjoy.  Bummer.  The service has always been a problem, even at the old location.  There are usually 2 servers, max.  They are nice, but have a hard time keeping up with everything.  A few of our sodas went unfilled multiple times.  The waiter was really nice, I felt bad for him.    Finally, they didn't have any salted caramel gelato, which used to be the best gelato in town!  I don't know if they just didn't have it that day, or if they don't make it anymore in general.  Overall, I got to eat 1 out of the 3 items I was hoping to eat, and the 1 item was sub-par.    I think they might be making an attempt at being more upscale, which I think is a mistake.  They need to be more approachable and comfortable, not less.    I'm really sad, because I really used to love this place.

"Its really hard for me to rate this place with stars. I came here and ordered their special birria tacos, carne asada fries, and their cantaloupe water. Lets start with the moment I walked in to place my order. As other reviewers mentioned, this place has in fact previously been a nightclub. I couldn't help but notice how dark it was in here. When ordering, you need to walk up to the bar. I didn't like the professionalism with the workers. When you actually go, you would notice that the people working seem very inexperienced. As I was about to order, some other customer jumps in front of me and made changes to her order, and the employee taking orders didn't even tell her to hold on. I thought that was a little rude. Finally I placed my order, and the girl was very friendly. She asked me if I wanted to dine in or takeout. I told her I will dine in. She hands me a receipt with my order number on it and I took a seat and waited for them to call my number. As my boyfriend and I sat and waited, I could not stand the really bad smell of this place (remind you, I had a mask on the entire time). Its really hard to explain the exact smell, but pretty much it smelled like a very dirty bathroom (like straight urine in the entire place). My boyfriend decides to use their restroom after wiping down our table, and when he got back he told me that the bathroom had bugs everywhere. The vibe in this place was very sketchy and weird in my opinion. From the really bad urine smell in this place, to the bug infested restroom, to the highly intoxicated customers that walk into this place. As soon as our order was called, I told the people to just make our order to go. There was no way I could have enjoyed my meal while the place smelled like a homeless person urinating on himself. We ended up eating our meal in the car. Now as far as the food goes. The birria tacos were actually OK. I like how they were not cheap with the meat. Although the meat was a little bland, it did have a nice flavor after adding their red and green salsa to it. The three birria tacos definitely filled me up. For an order of 3, they were $10. The only reason I wouldn't mind paying the $10 for them is because they did have a lot of meat in them. Now for the carne asada fries. NOT good at all. The meat on there tasted like they came out of a garbage can or rotten. If you were to take all the meat off of it, its pretty much something you can easily make at home. The fries were also soggy. Not sure how because I ate them as soon as I walked into the car. These fries for $8.99? Totally not worth it in my opinion. Lastly, the cantaloupe water. I thought it had a really nice taste to it. Surprisingly, the cantaloupe tasted really fresh with the perfect amount of sugar. The size of the drink was good too. The only negative thing I can say about the water is I wish it would have been more cold before serving it with ice. Just a little tip: maybe in the summertime, you can pre stir the water in a jug of ice, then serve it with more ice! Now my honest brutal opinion: I don't think I would ever return. After finishing my meal, I felt really gross. In my head I couldn't help but think of how unfresh the food was, given the uncleanliness of the inside of the establishment. To be honest, I'm not sure how they are still in business. Meaning, I'm surprised the health inspectors have not shut them down due to how dirty the interior of this place is. I really wished I could have written a more positive review of this place just so I help help support a small business, but I truly apologize, I cannot. I really do not think I can recommend this place to others. Just a huge tip: If you own a restaurant, please make sure that you have your place smelling good. If it smells like urine, your customers will run! Lastly, for those reading this review, I chose to rate this place with two stars based strictly on everything I ordered.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The variety was the only good thing about this place. All items were over priced. To add chicken to a salad is $1 and some change but you get a spoon full. The ingredients were not fresh and they did not take the time to preserve the apples and avocado. The decor was odd, like it wasn't thought all the way through. The salad was served in a silver dog bowl with a plastic fork. The staff was not friendly. After she dumped the balsamic all over my salad it ended up tasting like a la Madeleine mixed spring salad. And when asking if they had Gorgonzola she said ""do you mean mozzarella?"" No, ma'am those are two different cheeses.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The stuffed shrimp plate was very good but came with no bread, which is a staple in this kind of restaurant, and the server never brought the salad that came with it. We also had to ASK for refills on our tea. The chocolate dessert was frozen pre-made food service kind.

"In a buttery solution my noodles float. What once was considered Alfredo sauce is now perceived as merely a tub of watery devastated loneliness. What appears to be chicken sinks menacingly to the bottom. I attempt to pierce the thick, hard, and crusty surface, but to no avail as my fork cannot penetrate that which is impenetrable. ""Is this even chicken?"" My mind asks as I finally scoop a piece of the mystery meat from the depths of the buttery ocean. Upon tasting, I learn the true identity of said mystery meat. Chicken it is. How old is this chicken you ask? From what farm does it hail? To that I say, its older than me, and the farm lies deep beneath the crust of our planet. Some know this place as the abyss. Others know it as hell. For there is no way chicken could ever be THIS hard when made on earth.

"My team had to meet up with another company at Champps in mid-August. I felt trepidation when I learned it was a sports bar, since I am a committed foe to all sports bars (I don't watch team sports, nor do I drink alcohol so i am not the target audience).   To be sociable, i came along. We were seated outdoors, which i liked, because it meant we were away from the blaring TV sets.   Though we had reservations, our (admittedly large) party was seated in literally opposite corners of the patio, so we periodically sent runners back and forth to maintain communications.   The wait till they took my order was painfully long. Despite scintillating conversation, we got restive. Our waitress came by, you understand - we weren't abandoned. She just wouldn't take our order for eons.  Once the orders were made, she delivered them erratically. Our table had 6 people. Two got their order. 15 minutes later, three more got their order. Who was left out? Me. Mine came around 40 minutes after the first people. It was a mystery. It couldn't have been cooking times , because the orders in the first and second waves overlapped. (One order of fish & chips in each.) Plus my own long-delayed meal was a simple medium-rare steak - and how long does THAT take to prepare?  My cup of French Onion soup was ok. My steak sucked. It was mealy and overcooked. I was sad, but ate most of it anyway, rather than harass the waitress, despite the urging of my fellows, because I didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for a steak plus no guarantee it would be done right .   On the other hand, perhaps I was a fool to order a steak at a sports bar.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"We were so disappointed in our service. This is a neat location, but was quite slow for a Saturday night. Right off the bat the hostess took several minutes to notice us, then we asked to sit outside and were told there was no seating (however there were multiple empty tables the entire time we were there). Then the delays really started. Our waiter took forever to even get our drink order, so we ordered our meal at the same time. Then we waited... and waited... no apology, no excuses, just never saw him. The table next to us had salad and bread... we never saw any bread. Had to chase him down for the one refill we got, but the food was good when we finally got it.

"Not long ago, I wrote a glowing review for Pane Rustica.  The food ""was"" sublime and one dish in particular, the Pappardelle with Lobster, Jumbo Shrimp and Scallop in a Saffron Lobster Sauce, was to say the least one of the best dishes I've had anywhere.  So to celebrate our wedding anniversary we chose to dine at Pane Rustica tonight.  Much to our surprise, the aforementioned dish is no longer on the menu.  We had been told this dish was the most popular on the menu and it would never be removed.  When we asked why the dish was no longer available, our server said they were going in a new direction.  Unfortunately, the new direction is the wrong one.  We asked what replaced the Pappardelle dish and our server enthusiastically recommended the Rissoto, with Red Crab, Lobster and Scallop.  Sounds good right?  WRONG.  What arrived was a large bowl, with a Rissoto'ish mixture in the middle, surrounded by a clear reddish broth.  The rissoto was flavorless, and instead of what we anticipated would be chunks of succulent crab, lobster and scallop, was a mashed up mess that resembled a Frozen Dinner from Lean Cuisine.  I did find one little piece of lobster and there was one smaller grilled scallop.  For $28, this dish missed on so many levels, and it wasn't one dish, three of us ordered this dish.  One member of our party ordered the Salmon and requested it be cooked Medium.  It came well done and for $32 was not nearly as good as the Salmon dish she'd had previously.  I will say the flat bread pizza options are always good, so that didn't disappoint.   Our server asked how our dishes were and we told her they were truly disappointing.  She said the manager offered free dessert, but the manager certainly didn't feel it worth his or her time to visit our table.  We declined the dessert and paid our bill.  The total for 4 (including a $32 bottle of wine) was $180 (not including tip) and it truly wasn't worth the price of admission.  I'm sorry to say we thought after multiple visits to Pane Rustica, we had rediscovered a forgotten jewel in Tampa.   Tonight's visit cured that.  There's an old saying.  If something isn't broken, don't fix it.  Too bad Pane Rustica forgot that golden rule.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Service at the bar is good. Service at the tables - marginal. Servers seem to lack experience. I base this on the speed they move with and how priorities are out of order.

I just prefer sitting at the bar.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I rate the restaurants in relation to the price level.  It's unfair to expect much from Olive Garden when their entrees cost $13 on average.  Hotel du Village is an upscale restaurant in a great setting in picturesque Bucks County, PA.  The interior is darkly lit with candles and provides for a romantic ambiance.  We loved the setting and the atmosphere.  The food however is just average overall and definitely not up to the level of the prices charged.  Most entrees are in the $27-$30 range. As a group of 4 we had for appetizers escargo (very good), palm heart salad (okay), and lamb sausage (a bit salty, but okay).  For main entree I had filet mignon with bearnaise sauce.  The meat was ordered medium to medium-well.  Inside it was done properly, but the outside was charred, which totally spoiled the taste for an expensive steak.  I tried drowning it in bearnaise sauce, which helped, but at this price level I would think they should know how to prepare steak.  The side dishes were simple asparagus and potatoes.  Nothing innovative.  Presentation was closer to Olive Garden than to anything on the fancy side.  Overall the entrees had a spirit of simple country kitchen, lacking in imagination and finesse.  Avoid the bathrooms.  It had the aura of the outhouse with rustic dark stall, where the door didn't latch.  Everything there was decrepid.  The sinks had two faucets (hot and cold) and you could only open one at a time, since you had to hold it open with one hand.  The airplane bathrooms are of similar feel, but look cleaner.  Overall, it's not worth nearly $300 for 4 people that we spent.  Maybe for half that much it would be passable.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"After my last Mad River experience in Old City, I never thought I'd set foot in one again-- that is, until I heard the words ""free beer.""  Philly Sport and Social Club chose this locale for their annual winter party so some members of my coed football team, the Bayside Tigers, decided to check it out.  I have to admit, the Mad River peeps put on a nice little shindig.  From 7-9, all PSSC members were sectioned off in a large room with tons of finger foods and free Coors Light bottles.  Five stars for the party itself.  And now for the reasons why I will never return:  -The dj was terrible and resembled a sleepy bear who was woken out of hibernation to play some cds... bad cds.  -The crowd was of the popped collar variety.     -The bathrooms were reminiscent of elementary school-- I guess the renovation money was only for the bar area? -It's Mad River.  Bonus reason: It isn't really fair to hold Mad River accountable for this but I'm going to anyway.  Because most of our team ended up drinking all night, we were all a little hungover the next morning for our playoff game.  Our play was severely hindered and we promptly lost to a team called Ridiculously Good Looking.  Damn you, free beer at Mad River, damn you!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I thought a 20-25 minute wait time was a good sign of the upcoming food, but it was not.  While the grouper and fish sandwich were done very well, the value of them is pretty poor. Sides are extra - no biggie if it's $5 for a sandwich, but it's $7.95-14.95 for a sandwich. I ordered a side of fries still, and they were a bit soggy and salty.  The coffee was good at least!

I was looking forward to what was to be a really good slice of pie.   We opened the door for the waitress that was flying around the tables (didn't say thank you...ok rude -1 star) and go up to the cashier who also wanted nothing to do with us. Brushed it off and returned home with our $20 large half buffalo chicken and chalanga pizza. To my dismay, the toppings were pretty unevenly distributed. Some pieces were completely neglected with any chicken or chorizo and there were bald spots near the crust!! I paid 20 bucks for this??  The buffalo chicken was good but pretty much was an abstract painting of Frank's red hot and marzetti blue cheese dressing with sprinkles of chopped up chicken breast.

"I've ordered taro at other Kung Fu locations and  never had bad tea. I've ordered taro all over and it has always been purple. Their boba is sweet and perfectly cooked but something is desperately wrong with their taro tea at this location.  I first got my order and couldn't tell the color was wrong under their dim lighting, it wasn't until I got outside and sipped it that I noticed it didn't taste like taro, more like coffee or thai tea.  Then I put my flashlight on it and realized it was brown, probably the wrong drink, no worries, hate to bother them but was really looking forward to taro so I go back inside, wait my turn, explain to the gal I think they made me the wrong drink. She squints at it, yells at another girl making drinks who also squints at it, she claims 'that's black tea, that's how it is' and I again say 'it doesn't taste like taro and it's not the usual purple color so I just wanted to check'  she says it's not the wrong drink but she'll make it for me again.  I wait and hope maybe this one will come out right but sadly no, I got the same weird brown not-taro flavored tea back but with more sugar in it.   I could understand if the first one was made wrong by accident (use the wrong base, forget the taro flavor, etc it's cool that happens no worries) but to have the second one come out the same and have them claim it was taro was just mind boggling to me. :( Just disappointed since this location is close to the convention center it would have been convenient to get my daily taro fix there during con.

"SHORT REVIEW: Trash Tinga (chicken) tacos. Decent Carnitas (pork) tacos. I'll go again...but on Tuesdays.  LONG REVIEW: It was a struggle, to be honest, to really like everything at once. In a nutshell, it wasn't underwhelming, not overwhelmingly sensational; I was just... 'whelmed.' There were a number of different aspects of Urban Eats to take into consideration. Keep reading to learn the real deal. -- LOCATION//SPACE: The location is prime. I'll give it credit! This particular space, on S. Meridian St., right in the heart of the Warehouse District and nightlife zone of downtown. A number of entrepreneurs have tried this space before, to obviously undesired results. The space within the location is really nice and definitely appropriate for where it is and its prime-time audiences. Staying open through nightlife hours definitely helps make it make sense. This part works! -- FOOD//DRINKS: I joined some friends on Taco Tuesday (which is a #win). I'll start here: the price was key. $2 TACOS. You read it right. Yeah, they're small, but they're $2. Yeah, theymaynotbeastastyastheyshouldbe, but they're $2. (Glazed over that part with intention.) I got great reports of the fish tacos being the gold medal winner of the several options they offer. So get those. From my experience, I will not be having the Tinga (chicken) tacos again, as it was flavorless and unexciting. Contrarily, the Carnitas taco made me smile. They all came served fresh, with just enough topping like cilantro, lime, etc. On the bright side, the smokey, rich salsa was wonderful. And the queso was brilliant--a delightful surprise; the bowl seemed endless. It was incredible. Two waves of friends went through two bowls of chips with the same bowl of cheese and still hadn't scraped the bottom of the bowl dry. Strangest thing I've ever seen in my life. -- SERVICE: Nothing out of the ordinary here. It was right and fairly in the middle. Prompt, as we would hope. Clear and precise, as we would hope. .... (Facebook thumbs up). -- EXPERIENCE: Our crew spent a few hours in Urban Eats. Sure, the food (re: chips and queso), laughter and people watching kept us occupied, but the DJ sealed the deal. Having a DJ or two spinning fresh tunes and not serving up stale muzack through low-fi overhead speakers was a game-changer. It makes the atmosphere feel more contemporary and energized. Not sure if this happens nightly or during the day.  Why didn't Urban Eats get 5 Stars? Everybody likes 5 Stars. Success wears different clothes to different people. I'd venture to say that a food & service-focused restaurant should make those areas top priorities. But I didn't get enough greatness there. Instead, it was better in other ways that come in at the bottom of the totem pole.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"On Central Avenue, near Kool Daddy Records and close to all the vintage shopping you can imagine. I was told about this place, and didn't realize it was a convenience store in the front and the restaraunt in the back.   First thing I noticed was it didn't look so clean, second I noticed was how friendly the two men were. I ordered a hamburger which comes with fries for $4.99. They have a tiny area to dine on the stools and one table. The guy who fixed my sandwich wasn't wearing any gloves and I hoped he had washed his hands silently. Later, when I went to pay the same guy was working the register and I was pretty sure I hadn't seen him wash his hands. After paying for my food I went down the street to eat outside and found mold on the sandwich bread. Too bad I had already taken a bite before noticing it, so far it seemed to have been a tasty burger but it bothered me if he had washed his hands or not and who wants to eat moldy bread?? The fries seemed too crispy and fried, but I didn't get that far yet.   I went back to the store and told the guy who fixed my sandwich, he politely insisted I go to the back of the store where the other worker was, although I was very calm and discreet when explaining why I wanted a refund. I showed him the mold and returned my other items as well, he was very polite and apologized. I was issued a refund on my card, to which he provided the receipt. Unfortunately, I will not return because it's uncomfortable to have to question if your food is fresh and if hands are clean.  This place has been around for quite some time, I think it said 20 years on the menu. I would suggest updating the interior of the store and making sure that it looks really clean, and providing more seats. The downtown area caters to an eclectic group of people, but they will do well by taking advantage of such a central location and all the new residents moving into the contempororary/modern apartment buildings around. I really hope they update it for a sleek modern or artsy look and tackle the attentiveness to cleanliness, along with getting their menus out and advertising the convenience store deliveries so they can be even more successful. They should also have a website online somewhere.   Pros: Friendly Service          Grocery items in the store can be delivered if you live in the area          The food might be good           The area has an eclectic, artsy, vintage bohemian vibe          Reasonable prices  Cons: Not sure how clean and sanitary this place is, my instinct didn't want to trust it          Dining in is available if you just want to eat your food quickly and go, not really for hangin out it could get crowded easily",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"My boyfriend & I live close to this restaurant and have dined here several times. There is no point in having reservations to this restaurant.  The restaurant staffs young ladies at the front hostess stand and they have no idea how to seat reserved tables along with walk-ins. In the past we have had four different reservations where we have waited at least 45 min after our requested time for a table. Also, each time we had a reservation the hostess tried to seat us in the bar area rather than the restaurant.  For one of the instances that was a special occasion I had to argue with the hostess to be seated at a table in the restaurant. Also,  note when you make the reservation the person on the phone doesn't ask for a preference or if this is a specual occasion.   Tonight we sat in the bar & enjoyed the service from Krista.  She was wonderful & did a great job. We wish we could say the same for the restaurant. We took home a piece of dessert & were disapoointed to see this miniture piece of cheesecake for $8.50. We could have gotten something better for this price than two bites of cheesecake.  This is a complete ripoff & was not worth half the amount charged. We continue to hope Harrys won't let us down,  only to be disappointed by the value of food for the price charged and lack of ability to respect a reservation. The servers and bartebders are always excellent. Desserts are not worth the very small portion. I do not recommend reserving a table since they don't know how to properly seat a reservation on time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"My boyfriend and I recently moved to Philly and were referred here by some friends. We ordered the ""works"" pizza and some chicken flatbread. We're from Chicago and honestly I can't say that we were impressed, the pizza just tasted like regular frozen pizza you put in the oven. However , the flatbread was ok.

"First time here. Weird weird vibe. Was there at 1 p on a weekday and the place was nearly empty. Service was OK but it was obvious the waitress was trying to finish her shift and get out. Didn't really offer food recommendations when asked, asked her if fries came with any sandwiches and it was a quick ""no"". (Wouldn't you then ask the customer if they like to add fries for $xxx?). Upsell opportunity! The sandwich was OK, but greasy. I'll give it another try but color me unimpressed after first visit. Have a gut feeling they will not last much longer.

"I put La Creperie at a 2.5 stars...but ""meh, I've experienced better"" seemed closer to my experience than ""A-OK"".  Service was very nice and polite--no complaints there. Food was tasty--my husband and I split two crepes: (1) ham, cheese, mushroom, spinach, and we added egg to it (because we both love eggs!), and (2) the salmon with creme fraiche.  Both were delicious--the crepe portion just sweet enough, the fillings savory...  But I left this place with a pretty bad taste in my mouth--because of pricing.  Some of it was less incriminating (yes, your menu *does* say a small cup of black coffee is $3.50...though I have no idea how you can justify that price; yes, you have fresh-squeezed orange juice...for $6, which could buy me a whole gallon of the stuff, or a crate of oranges).    The more annoying charges: we added egg to our crepe, and that's apparently an extra $1.50 (...which could get me a full dozen eggs).  Oh, you want this crepe, but you want to add a wee bit of ham to it?  extra $4.  Oh, you want the same ingredients as the omlette, except wrapped in a crepe?  extra $5.  Look...I don't mind that charging extra to add stuff...but don't you think that adding 50% to the price of the original dish for just a ""wrapper"" is excessive?  The crepes were good (not life-changing, but solid), but given that they're already pricey, and given how many ridiculous surcharges there were tacked on to our final check, I doubt we'll be back too soon.  It hurts me, because I really do think the folks there were super sweet...it's just hard to justify paying $$$ for solid, but not mind-blowing crepes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"- ( A SATURDAY NIGHT ) Waited in line for 20 minutes for only 2 customers out of the 5 families in front of me to make purchases. By 30 minutes i just stepped out of line and used the kiosks to purchase game cards for my children who were very tired of waiting and wanted to get out there and play like the other kids. While waiting in line i noticed that NO one wears hair nets (which most of the employees were women with long hair) & about 3 at the time i noticed were restocking the salad bar ! i figured customer service wouldn't be so great being that there was only one lady at the register trying her best.

I went back yesterday and ordered the shrimp lo mein, vegetable fried rice and fried chicken wings.  The chicken smelled so delicious on my way home but sadly it fell way short on flavor.  It was pretty bland.  It was just like plain fried chicken with very little seasoning.  Didn't have the flavorful taste that you get with most Chinese style chicken wings.

We came in hoping to be able to order off the menu, but during the hours of the jazz buffet all you can get is the buffet.  That was a bit disappointing.  The food on the buffet was disappointing as well.  I enjoyed my omelet, and that's it.  I wish we would have had the opportunity to order a real meal.

"This is the second location of a restaurant already open and established in Brandon.  As someone from Chicago, I was curious when I first saw the sign at this location announcing the opening.  My mom, husband, and I decided to check it out tonight.  There was a pretty good number of people in the restaurant when we arrived, and we placed our order at the counter.  That was at 7:23 PM.  We sat, waiting for our order.  The minutes passed.  15m.  20m.  At that point, I realized that most of the people in the restaurant were also waiting for their orders.  I couldn't imagine what was taking so long, but we continued to wait patiently.  Another family eating there seemed to have gotten aggravated with the long wait time and went up to the counter to see what was going on.  The adult male in the group was clearly angry, and one of the men working in the kitchen wasn't really having it.  He said that they were told that it would be 30-40m for their order.  The customer said there was no such warning from the young man working the register.  They ended up leaving.  Afterwards, I did mention to one of the other employees that we also had not been given a wait time.  Had told me upfront that I'd be waiting that long for a burger, I'd have turned right back around and headed for the door.    It was just a few minutes before 8 PM when our order finally arrived - party of it, anyway.  We all had burgers and fries.  My mom and I both had the mushroom and Swiss, while my husband had the ""#1 Chicago's Best Burger.""  We also ordered some wings that arrived about 5m later than the rest of the food.    The good parts:  the fries were nice, likely fresh cut.  My husband enjoyed his burger.  The combination of flavors was appealing to him.  The not-so-good parts:  My mom and I were both underwhelmed with our burgers.  The patties were pretty thin, so getting them cooked to medium rare was likely a tall order.  They weren't bad, honestly, but they weren't great, either.  After waiting more than 30m for that food to get to the table, I was hoping for better than ""just meh.""  The wings were a good size, but nothing really special.  My husband had the bbq flavor, and I got the mild buffalo.  He said the bbq were ok.  The buffalo sauce, on the other hand, was definitely NOT mild and unbalanced.  Waaaay too much vinegar there.  Even a healthy slathering of bleu cheese dressing wasn't enough to put out that fire or tone down the acidity.  I realize that, when you open any new restaurant, it is going to take time to ramp things up and work out the kinks.  When it is a second location, though, logic would dictate that you bring experienced folks from the first location to help make that opening smoother.  Maybe the grill in the kitchen was too small.  Maybe there was someone inexperienced cooking.  Whatever the reason, something needs fixing there.  I don't care how good your food is if it takes more than a half hour for a burger to hit the table.  While we were offered apologies for the delay, there were no other measures taken to try to make it up to us and encourage us to return again when our experience might be better.  Unfortunately, I'm not inclined to give it another shot.  There are far better burgers to be had in Tampa, and you won't be twiddling your thumbs waiting for your order to be ready.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Um..I think I see what this place is trying to do but its not doing a great job executing it..at least not yet. The craft cocktails are good and well made albeit pricier than they should be. Two of the three bartenders were on point while the 3rd just flirted with any girl with a face. The decor is nice and looks pretty cool.   The crowd was 'eclectic' to be as nice as possible, and the DJ that came on was downright laughable. Ironic 90s hip hop for white folks mixed with pop hits of last year.  It drew the wrong kind of folks to the 'dance floor'...I saw the goth girl from the movie The Craft and pretty sure the Latina woman from 1980s Sesame Street.   The place smells like bbq inside but they dont make bbq.  I guess a restaurant shares walls and apparently they share ventilation too.  Kinda gross.

"Place was mostly empty on a Father's day. Maybe people are cooking at home today.  Table was sticky and dirty with crumbs. Hostess dropped a table knife on the floor and put it back on the plate right in front of us.   Our server (not the careless hostess) was nice, polite, and attentive. However, she failed to mention the salads were an additional $4.99 when she offered them with our entrees. It's a simple courtesy most customers would find useful.  The complimentary bread and dipping oil are always a nice touch. Two out of four entrees were good: Rigatoni with chicken/ broccoli and Fettuccine chicken alfredo. The lasagna lacked enough meat in the 'meat' sauce while the rigatoni domani was flavorless and runny. Seemed like the water they boiled it in was passed off for a sauce.

The noodles they used as garnish smelled like a wet rag.  The pho broth was also the worst I have had also.  It was bland and watered down.  The service was terrible.  It was so bad.  Not once were we asked how things were, and a huge pet peeve in service industry:  the waiter fails to say ""excuse my reach.""  He just leans over the table to refill water.  Servers severely lack etiquette and this was the first time if my life where a server asks their patrons to help then grab a piping hot bowl of pho - or if anything for that matter.

He was nice that he gave me a sample, unfortunately it had that distinct taste. So I opted for a chai tea with coconut milk. It cost over $5 for a 16oz (yikes) and crazy enough it also had that distinct floral sour taste. I was baffled and unfortunately threw out about 3/4 of the beverage. I just couldn't do it.

"2.5 Stars  The atmosphere is pleasant, the server/bartender was friendly, and the watermelon mojito was tasty (though tiny).   Of the three small plates we shared, only one could be classified as 'good' - the grilled chicken skewers with habanera sauce.  Perhaps, because, as my companion suggested, they couldn't do anything to ruin those?  That's it for the pros.  Now the cons:  the meatball small plate was 'fair', consisting of 3 lukewarm meatballs in a forgettable red sauce, served with 3 small pieces of toast. The shrimp ceviche appetizer might have been, no, it WAS, the worst I have ever had.  Consisting of an abundance of julienned peppers and red onions, with perhaps three teensy, baby, flavorless, frozen shrimp thrown in, it was a tasteless disaster.

"We were there as a party of 4 on a Saturday night which was a challenge as we were told they don't take reservations for fewer than 5 people.  Cocktails were good and though the menu was pretty limited, food was well prepared and tasty.  We had lobster which was a total pain in the ass to shell but really delicious.  We also had some delicious Oysters from Maine as well as a selection of others chosen by the server.  We decided to enjoy an after dinner drink before ordering dessert and, as the restaurant wasn't nearly as busy as when we walked in, we felt we had time to do this.  Once ordered, dessert came pretty quickly (ice cream which was great) and shortly after ordering another round of drinks the server told us she was bringing our check since they had other reservations.  This was a bit of a surprise since we were a table of 4 and we were not able to make reservations for so few people.  Do they take reservations for 4 after a certain time of night?  Who was in desperate need of our table?  I've never been kicked out of a restaurant when we were so clearly ready to keep spending money.  Another surprise was the $600 bill.

There isn't much room when you first walk in, I almost hit a patrons chair walking in. I am part Greek myself, and I would never go back.

"We came to Bubba Gump to check out the hype. My wife and I actually visited the one in the Cancun airport first a couple years ago. We didn't just go for Bubba Hump though.   I had checked out the menu beforehand and found the prices high. But then, I get you are paying for the branding and all that. You're paying for the hype.   However, when we sat down and saw that draft beers were $15 we were almost outraged! But then you get to keep the BG glass. Ok, so how much of you don't want the glass? $10.   So you want to charge people ten freaking dollars for Budweiser or Bud Light? That's ludicrous! So...I'm having a beer at home instead.   My mother-in-law got the fish and chips, which she enjoyed. My stepson got the cheeseburger, which he enjoyed. He goes down from there.   My wife got the shrimp Mac and cheese. It looked great, nice presentation but she said it tasted bland. Which was really weird for Mac and cheese unless you buy a generic brand from the grocery store. I tried a bite, and yes, it was actually really bland. Even with the shrimp. Meh.   I ordered the shelled shrimp bucket. It smelled great and looked cool. However, it also was bland! Barely any flavour.   I'll tell you why - so the shrimp tasted like they boiled the shrimp. Also, they over boiled them because they were pretty much like rubber. Ok, so they boiled them, put in some sauce, then gave them a toss.    Here's the deal, gang, when you peel the shells off, guess what else you are taking off. Yep, all the sauce. So whatever flavour they want the shrimp to have is gone in the bucket with the shells.   I can't believe I have to tell a shrimp place how to make shrimp. Oh well, we can say we tried it.   The food gets one star, but I added a second star because the service was decent. I'd say go to Red Lobster instead. Or (!) there's this new place I've heard is good - The Captain's Boil.   Good night!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Both the duck and the veal had been cooked, overcooked, then microwaved, and our bread pudding, while delicious, also had been microwaved needlessly.

"Just are here, got gator nuggets a beer and the catfish lunch special. The nuggets were alright I was happy at first. Unfortunately that's about the most positive part of my experience.   I'll start with the catfish, it was literally inedible. It tasted like someone left the fish out for the night and rolled it in bleach. I had one bite and now my stomach hurts. Why drago whyyyy. Finally, I asked the prices of their beer and was told they were between $4-6 dollars. I asked how much a bud light costs and was told that it was the cheapest beer. To my surprise the beer cost $6 and when I questioned my server about it she told me that since she had not directly said the beer was $4 dollars that I had to pay for it and nothing could be done. When we pointed out that she had tipped herself 20% instead of the 18% my beer became free!

The deep dish will not be making any Chicagoan forget Lou's, Giordano's or Uno's.  It was pretty bad.  The crust was hard enough to chip teeth.  The cheese was a slick mess.  The previously mentioned sauce was in giant lumps on some pieces, not at all on others. It wasn't anything like real Chicago style pizza.

"Disappointing food, limited menu, cramped quarters.  Altogether ""meh.""  We went the weekend before Valentines Day 2012.  We went b/c we heard it was a romantic casual french bistro.  If you are in the mood for communal dining, it's ok, but romantic, definitely not.  Tables inches from eachother (literally elbow room) do not make for a romantic meal, especially when your adjoining guests are loud-talkers.   I ordered the classic french frisee salad with lardons (thick bacon) and a poached egg on top, to start.  When made right, it's awesome - - like a perfect BLT (sans T) with rich egg yolk.  This salad's lardon's were literally lard-like---soft, thick, fatty pieces of bacon --not crisp like they should be.  And the dressing was some wimpy, nondescript oily sheen.  So pathetic, such a poor start to the meal.  My entree was skate -- they had 3 seafood entrees to choose from, salmon, scallops and skate -- not a big selection.  The skate was ok, but not memorable, and I don't think I need to eat skate again.  My husband had the lamb shank.  It was tender and falling-off-the-bone, but lacked depth of flavor.  You can do alot with a lamb shank at home in a crock pot with some red wine, rosemary and garlic, so basically it was not that impressive.  The chocolate bread pudding dessert was warm and chocolately as it should be --if the first 2 courses weren't so lame, the bread pudding would have put a great finish to the meal.  The waitresses' french accents were nice.  But all in all, this was a one and done.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"My sister and I are both from the Southwest and therefore have fairly high expectations of Mexican food, so when she was recently in town we decided to give this place a try. My cheese enchiladas were overcooked and SWIMMING in grease and her entrée was in similar shape. Also, the rice and beans that came with our entrees were salty to the point of being almost inedible. Hate to say it, but we agreed the food was disgusting and we couldn't finish our food. Adding further to the experience was that the service was slow, though our server was nice. Three years in St. Petersburg and the only Mexican food I've found here that I would call ""good"" are the places located in food stores owned and operated by Mexican families, many or most of whose members speak little or no English, and where Mexican workers line up at breakfast or lunch to get food for their work day (a VERY good sign!). Chile Verde on 22nd Ave. N at 28th St. is one, the little café in the back of Mexico Lindo (a Mexican grocery store) in Pinellas Park is another.

Foods are good if it's properly ordered by the bartender. We just moved here from SF and was hoping to make this place our hang out but the service was very disappointed to say the least.

I added some salt and they were still tasteless. My mom and I ordered mojitos and they came back looking like mountain dews with lime in them. They had no mint and didn't taste of mint. They tasted like soda with a weird unauthentic lime flavor. I think they make their drinks with syrups and not actual ingredients. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the quesadilla I had that was halfway decent. My mom said the food was a waste about 3 times, and I agree.

I live within walking distance of the Lucky Did and have been several times. Each time I say it is my last. It is a nice clean establishment with a good selection of beers  The food is pricey for the quality of frozen appetizers and bagged lettuce. I had the potstickers this evening and bit into a wad of paper in the dry Asian slaw served with the them. The cost of the appetizer was removed from my check after I suggested they do so.   The staff is friendly but you can tell they want the tables to turn over quick. They come by frequently to check on you and the minute your plate is empty they are there to clear it. This would be fine if your fellow diners were also finished. I do not know what happened but my first trips to the LD were pleasant but now I won't go back.

"Finally went to 775 Gastropub, after being recommended by some friends. My wife and I rarely drink, so we did not go here for the brew, simply for the grub.   We went at 6pm on a Thursday night, and it was pretty dead. Got seated immediately, got to look over the large menu (maybe a tad too many items, but I like some choice, so I wouldn't change it). Most/several items on the menu use local produce/meat, such as the 775 burger my wife ordered. She ordered it medium well, and from what I could tell it was cooked properly, with a slight pink in the center. The meat was well seasoned, however it was dripping grease, and the bottom bun was soaked to the point of disintegrating near the end. It'd be worth lowering the fat content in their mix in my opinion. The fries were over-salted, to the point where some of the salt had to be rubbed off. Might be a fluke, the fries were excellent otherwise (a good middle ground between crispy and fluffy).   I ordered the fish and chips (cod), which I assumed would be good considering the restaurant has ""pub"" in it's name. Beyond the aforementioned over-salted fries, the cod was inconsistent. One piece was crispy to the point of being dark brown on the bottom, another was nice and golden all around, and the third was flaccid, and broke in half upon picking it up. It also seemed oily inside, so it seems the oil either wasn't hot enough or they tossed them in incorrectly.   The wait staff was mediocre, as some of the other reviews stated. The hostess did go and service some tables occasionally, and they kept our drinks topped off pretty well, but other than that, we felt kinda ignored. After receiving our food, we got a flyby asking if the food was good, without waiting to hear our response. We were unable to order a root-beer float (highly recommended, smooth ice cream and a gourmet, complex root beer) from our server, and had to ask the hostess when she came by to refill my drink. Keep in mind, it was pretty dead, with maybe a third of the tables occupied, and most of those only half full.   The ambiance is nice, and the items on the menu seem right up my alley, but this was a let down unfortunately. Especially when it comes to the price, the food seems maybe 20% higher than it should be. A $13 burger it is not... maybe $10 if they reduced the fat percentage by about 7-10%.   I wish them the best of luck, and I may come back if the reviews come in reliably higher, but until then I have no interest in returning.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"My niece and I stopped in after a long day on the river..  I read all of the reviews and expected the place to be very good.. Have to say we were both disappointed.  Even though there were only 2 other tables, it took over 5 minutes for them to come to our table. We ordered the Dragon roll, chicken stone bowl and crab rangoons.  The dragon roll was just ""ok"" and pretty small. The stone bowl was terrible because you could not even chew the chicken.  It was literally like rubber. We sent it back and ordered a bowl of fried rice so my niece could have something before heading on home.  They refused to take the stone bowl off of our bill even though she did not eat it. And still charged $3.99 for the bowl of rice we had to order to replace it.  Not really what I consider good customer service.  I also ordered spring rolls because i was still hungry from the small shushi roll.  So, its not like we were just trying to get something for free, I mean, we ordered several items.

Unfortunately, the experience went downhill from there. Food, which we were told came from a kitchen inside one of the hotels took a very long time to come out once we'd ordered. There were only three other tables with patrons, so being too busy couldn't be named as an excuse. When the food arrived, both our burger and steak salad's beef was room temperature, if that. Waitstaff was, again, very accommodating, but our replacement burger took just as long again to arrive.

Mizu Sushi Bar, off Wash Ave., while not terrible, conforms to this sense of apathy that is killing a once bustling & eccentric area of St. Louis.  From a service perspective, we maybe saw our waitress twice throughout our meal here - once to take our order, and another to pick up the bill. The empty chairs & tables during (what should be) a very busy lunch hour added to the poor atmosphere that we experienced. We had contrastingly high hopes for the food, as we were the only people in there, so we expected more care & time put into our meals.

There was so much breading on the tiny morsels that it could have been anything! Dinner: I had chicken manicotti. It was extremely cheesy, extremely dry and well done. I didn't see any chicken. I'm not so sure it wasn't the lasagna slipped to me by mistake. $20 or so. (Salads do not come with entrees, btw) My bf had the NY strip. He sliced off a bit for me and half of that was fat and gristle. What I placed in my mouth was very tough and still half gristle, unfortunately! It had a Gorgonzola sauce on top (I loved it, but you must REALLY LOVE Gorgonzola), so I couldn't tell if the meat had good flavor. BF said the entire steak was gristle and the Gorgonzola sauce was overpowering. $28 for a very poor cut of meat! Dessert: The tiramisu was odd. It was a glassful of flavored mascarpone with a couple of very hard cookies tossed at the bottom. And I think some swirls of cocoa. That's it. That's some lazy tiramisu!

My pancakes were HUGE, but they were also dense, thick, and a mega gut punch--not at all fluffy and flavorful as I would have hoped. Honestly, they seemed like they had been mixed inexpertly using Krusteaz mix and not enough moisture. There were berries, though, so that was helpful.

"Years ago, Wendys had a great commercial. The actress, I forget her full name but her first name was Clara and it made her famous, is at a fast food burger restaurant looking at a tiny patty. Her response, one that became a catch phrase and a smash for Wendy's, was WHERES THE BEEF????  Today's trip to Smashburger reminded me of that famous commercial but instead of a burger, it was a grilled chicken sandwich.   This was the absolute smallest piece of chicken breast I have ever seen. I could slip it under a door or mail it in a number 10 envelope.   There was more cheese than Breast meat. A few onion straws.

"We went there last Saturday and my wife ordered a burger while I was selecting a beer. The video menu listed an upgrade from a 6 ounce burger ($6.99), to an 8 ounce burger for an additional $1.79.  The counter staff didn't seem to understand and a manager walked over and said ""this is wrong"", then he took out an iPad and erased the upgrade from the video menu. It was insulting and I have to wonder what kind of business operates this way other than Guido's Take It Or Leave It Mob Hut. We left and went to another burger place on Central.  It wasn't like $1.79 was an absurdly low price for 2 extra ounces of burger. Today, I looked online at the Burger Monger menu and they list an 8 ounce burger for $8.99.  That's $2 more than their 6 ounce single burger.  So - $1.79 was a horrible mistake, but $2 is okay. Someone in upper management needs to have a meeting with the St. Pete store.

"My gf and I have ordered delivery a handful of times and here's my thoughts... The taste is decently good and I guess it's reasonably priced.  But to cut straight to the point,the only items worth ordering are General Tsao's Chicken, Fried Rice, and Chow Mein.   For example :  The 16 oz ""broccoli beef"" we ordered consisted of literally 3 tiny strips of beef, a couple pieces of broccoli and a whole mess of carrots, celery, water chest nuts and whatever else.  The 16 oz ""Mongolian beef"" was the same.  A whole mess of frozen veggies.  I'm not exaggerating. It's blatantly obvious they're cutting food cost so they skimp on the meat and serve you up 95% veggies.   So if you must go here, stick to the Tsao's chicken and fried rice.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I literally had to pour half a bottle of salt to taste some seasoning on a stewed pork dish I've had many times at home and elsewhere.

That being said, the reason I gave 2 stars was because of my experience when buy my food.

"Went here with a large group for my cousins birthday. We had a booth reserved for table service and when they noticed how large our group was they quickly moved us to a booth that could accommodate our group. The bottle service was pretty impressive with reasonably priced bottles and the usual mixers to go with. We especially liked the way bottles are brought out with sparklers lit. A bit showy but all in good fun. The dancers in the bar were scantily clothed, but at least they were pretty to look at. We also liked the decor. The wall next to our booth is decorated in old speakers covering the entire wall. Was very interesting to look at and several people commented on it.  The biggest downfall of the evening for me was that when I went to the bar to order 8 drinks for my party and the bar tender told me there was a 4 drink max. I had a friend with me and said ""ok, 4 for me and then 4 for her"", because I was just trying to get along and get our cocktails back to our party. The bartender was not amused and said he would only make 4 drinks and I could come back to order again if I wanted more. I explained I was with the large group that had been ordering bottle service all night and that didn't seem to faze him. Apparently the only way to get good service in the bar is to order bottle service. I don't think I will return unless I am going to another birthday party.

"We waited over half an hour to be seated. The wait staff was friendly but incredibly slow once we actually were seated. The place doesn't really seems set up for a big brunch rush (i.e. its really hard for the wait staff to go in and out from the patio carrying anything more than two plates at a time). However, a lot of the wait staff just seemed to be meandering around, looking really bored, but always ready to talk about how 'crazy' things were on the the weekend (it didn't seem that crazy). Also, the food was pretty mediocre for what I was expecting. I had some of their breakfast potatoes (way too salty) and the egg sandwich (pretty good, but come on; how hard is it to mess up an egg sandwich?). The french toast was drenched in caramel and sugar; not really a healthy or appealing breakfast option, given the fact that it was humongous. The veggie hash, I will say, was pretty good. And they had excellent coffee selections and fresh squeezed orange juice. On the whole though, I wasn't too impressed.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"The restaurant is connected to my hotel and that is the ONLY reason I ate there more than once. The food is so-so. The Korean tacos had very little meat, the appetizer sampler with fried shrimp, chicken and ribs was over-cooked and the most of the ribs were left on the plate.  I sat at the bar and only after I was ready to pay did the server ask how the food was. When told that the food was not good, they did not seem to care.  When a customer leaves half of the food on the plate, they need to ask why and then do whatever it takes to make it right. Managers need to walk through and check with customers, but this never happened.

"I'll echo the consensus of cool atmosphere and decor but below average food and drinks. The food  and drinks for the quality is really overpriced. Came during happy hour which  is from 4 pm to 7pm. The happy hour features 2 dollars off drinks and 7 dollar bar bites.  I can't imagine actually paying full price for any of this. From the  7 dollar bar  bites options  we ordered the Piccadillo (beef)  empanadas (usually  11 dollars) with avocado corn and pico de  gallo, 2 carne Assado tacos ( usually$5.50 each), cheese dip with chips and veggie (usually $11), and the camarones patron- shrimp in a red chipotle sauce (usually 15 dollars).  To start, my friend got the  black diamond Rita (Maestro dobro Diamanté, black cherry  purée, simple syrup, lime juice, with A black sea salt rim  It was ok, but small.  Normally not a fan of cherry,  but I didn't mind the cherry flavor in this margarita. Not worth the  usual 12 bucks price point at all. The house margarita  (tradicional Silver, triple Sec, and housemade sour mix) which is normally $ 9.75 was not good. If you price you're  HOUSE margarita at a 10 dollar price point  it better be  pretty freaking good. It was not tart enough, not enough lime or sugar in the mix, just a watery tasting margarita The housemade sour mix I sampled alone before I ordered the margarita seemed promising which tasted fine on its own but  once mixed with  all that ice came out to a  watered down drink. It tasted like a lite"" margarita. I usually NEVER add flavors to my margarita. I like classic lime and sugar/ simple syrup, but i ended up asking the bartender to add the pomegranate  flavored syrup that  I first declined. With the house margarita you are able to add flavors no added charge (prickly pear, strawberry, passion fruit, mango).  My friend also got the ""antioxidant margarita"" -(Maestro Dobel Silver, Cedilla Acai Liqueur, Agave Nectar, Fresh Squeezed Lime Juice). She said she did not like it. The açaí tasted too artificial and I agreed when I tried. It's normally priced  $11.75.   Next drink I ordered  was the sangria and immediately upon tasting it l, I didn't like the flavor. Not because I do not like the flavor of sangria. I order sangria at restaurants aaaaall the time and I usually like my sangria wine and liquor forward not juiced down. The bartender made it to order and to me it  had a cherry cough syruppy taste. When our bar tender came over to check up on us and asked how everything was, I was honest and said that I didn't like it and asked if there was cherry flavor  used in it and she said no. I had my friend taste it too and said it was off.  I guess the bartender took it to offense that I was accusing her of making a bad  sangria because her response was in a very condescending tone  "" it taste like wine, do  you know what wine taste like?""  i made a face of  ""  are you serious right now"" and I  responded ""yes i know what wine taste like.."" and turned  away to my friend.  To be completely honest it tasted like the wine was stale plus cherry syrup added. There might have not been any cherry  flavor added but cherry notes in the wine, but it shouldn't taste that astringent or chemically (signs of stale wine). Because of that  rude comment and the way she said it, when she returned I said I was good and didn't want to order anything else. When we got our bill I informed her she rung up the wrong margarita and the happy hour specials weren't applied she said she would have to let her manager do it since we are cashing out after 7. She was annoyed and while at the register commented that ""it's not that much difference.""    I would have considered 3 stars because the food was not so bad that everything was inedible, but the rudeness of our server drops it to a 2.   3 stars  would mean I would be willing to try  down the line, but i will not be returning. If I had paid full price for any of these dishes, I would have sent them back and been less mum about my disappointment in the food quality. Red Mesa in downtown st. Pete, serves great Tex mex   food, where you get ambiance on 3 levels , and drinks  at very reasonable prices for the quality and also has happy hour.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This was my 2nd visit to Square One for Brunch (breakfast).  First visit was average.  This visit was below average.  We had a group of 15 with a reservation.  If you're going to give the table to one server, make sure it's your best server that can keep it together and provide top-notch service to a large group or provide them with some assistance in our case when one person can't quite do the job and is also distracted with other tables as well.  It took forever to order (easily 25 minutes from when we originally were greeted and drink orders taken), even when clearly we had long ago put down our menus.  Aside from overcooked poached eggs on three of the Benedict orders and other food that obviously sat in the window too long and arrived at the table less than hot and fresh some of the items were fine.  Pancakes were a standout, but be prepared to ask for extra syrup for sure and a salad with smoked salmon was also good.  After a 10-15 minute wait for freshly poached eggs to arrive, we were encouraged to slide them onto our previously sitting plates which were now rendered cold and lifeless instead of newly plated benedicts and potatoes being offered.  Coffees went unfilled even after being asked and additional drink orders were slow in being taken.  Total service time 2 hours for breakfast.  Perhaps lunch, dinner, or bar service is their forte, because breakfast/brunch apparently is not their strong suit.  Or maybe a table of 15 is just too large for one server to provide ideal service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Sad experience last night.  Bar area tables were dirty, so we sat at the bar.  Slow service, even though 2 people were working the bar. Ordered chicken tacos ( yum) and chicken enchiladas ( not yum). Had to ask for silverware.  My enchiladas were dry, and flavorless. Thankfully, I had salsa from my chips and salsa since neither the tacos or enchiladas were served with it, nor was it offered. Rice was dry and smothered with black beans which also covered part of my enchilada, so I did not eat that soggy mess.  Then a family with 3 rambunctious small kids came in and sat AT the bar !  There were now plenty of clean tables.  Friday night at 8pm is no place for kids sitting at a bar.

We ordered the Paella, Taste of Jamaica and the Fish tacos. The paella wasn't very tasty rather bland actually. The Taste of Jamaica I will not order again to pricey for the quality. My wife complained that the tomatoes in the Fish tacos tasted tinny as if they were canned and not fresh. 5. The bussers who brought the food still didn't know the table numbers so they stood with the food trying to figure out where to take it.

"This was an underwhelming experience. The food was disappointing, expensive, and the service is nonexistent.  I ordered the $100 sampler to try a little bit of everything with some friends. The brisket was dry, with no smoke flavor and no bark. The quarter chicken was not bad, juicy and tender, but the taste was unremarkable. The pulled pork was an absolute disgrace; it was a bland flavorless mush. Again, there was no bark and no smoke. I've made better pulled pork in a crock-pot.  The ribs were flavorful, I liked the taste of the dry rub added after the cook, but I feel like the majority of the flavor was not cooked into the meat. I could bake a chicken breast, add dry rub at the end, and get a similar flavor.  The baked beans were phenomenal! They had a nice spicy, sweet flavor and included brisket chunks. The green beans were also very good. The Mac and cheese was mundane and indistinguishable from Kraft Mac and cheese out of the box.  It's not a good sign when a bbq joint's highlights revolve around the side dishes. Still, the place was packed and it's smelled great from the outside.

Yelp showed me this place, and I thought ""Hey, hot and spicy soup, what could be better?""  Well, evidently, a lot of things.  I ordered the sun tofu chigae with seafood, and found it to be too salty, lacking in depth, and sprinkled with about 3 calamari rings, 2 small shrimp, and a small clam.  This is for a two regular person servings bowl at $7.99.  Now if this was the bees knees authentic and flavorful broth, veggie, and tofu soup I had known from better restaurants, I wouldn't be that disappointed.  As it is, though, I'm wishing I had simply warmed up some chicken broth with a little lime and siracha and tossed in some noodles - it probably would have been better seasoned.

"The price for two people to have dimsum has gone up substantially! This is the major difference I am seeing besides the renovation, new tables, and lack of iconic table cloths on some outer tables.  I was shocked to see our bill of $41 before tip after only having a few dishes. We had exactly 5 plates and a fountain coke. (They don't charge for the tea here.) Good thing big tips aren't the norm for dimsum...  Honestly I've been to Jumbo dimsum on the west side and paid $65 for three men, with healthy appetites, eat to their hearts content (20-30 dishes). Although it works out to around $20/person in both scenarios the volume of food is quite shocking.  Now would I say this place does better dimsum then Jumbo? Maybe, but does that justify the price... not in my books!  I feel like they are trying to cover their renovation costs. But it's hurting their business cuz we were there on a Sunday at 11am (prime time dimsum time) and it wasn't busy. There were a lot of open tables.

"It's unfortunate that our experience 5 years ago was drastically different than our return trip this weekend. The service and food has plummeted.   Our server never introduced himself (we only found out his name by the name tag) or bothered to have any kind of conversation with us. I honestly thought he was the runner until he came to take our food order. He didn't suggest anything, didn't seem pleasant, didn't offer more drinks, and was so brisk that I felt unwelcome. He was so fixated on adjusting our silverware and straightening the tablecloth over and over that I wondered if he was OCD or something. I got the prefix menu, which to him meant get each course to me in a flash and not let me have any time to enjoy it. He even started to bring out the table side flambé literally two minutes into us having our entrees. At that point, my husband was fed up and told him we were not anywhere near ready for dessert, he felt rushed and he needed to slow down. In what I felt was sarcasm, he just stood by several yards away and told us to let him know when we were ready.  Now, the food was pretty disappointing as well. The soups were probably the most edible part. The frog legs were not seasoned at all, bland as can be covered in fried batter. My duck was basically raw, I could only eat small bits of it to avoid food poisoning. The rice that came with it was tasty and all I could really enjoy. My dad's steak was undercooked as well and bland. The crawfish dish my husband got was also very bland. This is New Orleans...where is the seasoning?!  My husband spoke to the manager about the server and the food, to which she did remove our drinks from the bill, but I was unimpressed with how even after that, the server did not so much as acknowledge any wrong doing or apologize. The only reason I don't name him is because the manager did seem very surprised and concerned that this particular gentleman was providing such bad service. I hope she rectified the situation with him. I've never felt so rushed and unwelcome in a restaurant. It's really a shame.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING!  Visited yesterday and had we had the fish and shrimp platter along with the 4 bowl sampler: gumbo, shrimp creole, etouffe & jumbalaya. The fish/shrimp plate (a handful of fish/shrimp combined) was camoflauged by an unsavory collection of what appeared to be, dozens of microwaved potatoes underneath-$25 bucks!  Next was the 4 plate sampler. Looked delish, however when we dug in, it was terrible, all 4 plates. We are from Lake Charles LA and we clearly know what good, authentic creole cuisine tastes like. Among other things, they clearly lacked seasoning. The shrimp creole alone was a mixture of canned tomatoe sauce and 3 shrimp.   Waitress was pretty weird. If I didnt know any better I wouldve thought she wanted to pull up a chair & join us. She brought us out bread and told us to dip it in the etouffe- the weird part is she stood there waiting for us to dip! Needless to say, we didnt dip, rather we informed her we ""had it from there!""",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I used to come here often because of the big bowls of black rice or salad combos. The servings were generous and heaping, and always allowed me to save a little bit for the next day. I haven't been there in a few months and tonight, I ordered the same dish and was disappointed at the dramatic change in serving sizes. The bowls are gone and have been replaced by rectangular boxes that were at best, half full. Maybe it was the server, but my friend and I compared our meals to the posted pictures on Yelp from previous entries--it was not our hungry imagination.

My friend had the Mahi Mahi salad, and I wish I had had that.  Prices aren't too bad either.  So , the next morning when were we all hungover, we decided to go back.  We had heard their breakfast was very popular.  We obviously needed water bad, and our server got all our drink orders and we told him a round of waters also.  He was gone for atleast 15 minutes.  We were ""dying"" so I went up to the bar to get a few waters and to ask where our server was. He returned shortyly to take our order.  I ordered the ""lost bread"", which was AMAZING!  I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese, and what they brought out was mush.....they were gross and runny.  I sent them back and when they returned they were still mush.  Oh well.

"So I've ordered out of this place twice for work catering, so this is what my review is based on. First time was a relatively larger order, second time was a bit smaller (10 people).   So to start, I don't recall on the first time, but for the second time, our order arrived later by about 20 minutes. Also, the food feels largely mediocre, which is fine as I wasn't expecting crazy delicious food. We have tried the pizza (individual and larger ones), sandwiches, and the salads. The second time we ordered they also forgot an item, which was a bit inconvenient. At least I was refunded for it correctly.  Overall average pizza/sandwich place, but the service is a bit sub par.

I sat in the very back and it seems that THIS is their spot because suddenly my table was surrounded by a lot of people who kept looking at me like I was trespassing.  But what I found most interesting was that instead of eating the food from the buffet, they has big plates of rice soup (Watery rice) and stuff I did not recognize at all from the buffet. Spooooooky.

"Consistency is key.  And professional respect for your neighbors.  We went there the first time and we had a great time.  The server was polite and very attentive.  I had the Gin Atomic and the Manhattan is Burning.  Both were prepared by the owner and I was blown away by how great the drinks were.  My girlfriend and I then shared the charcuterie plate and the tuna tartare.  It's difficult to find a good cheese plate in Tucson and I was pleasantly surprised with this.  Great options including the mustard and various breads.  So far, so good.  We were so impressed by the service and the drinks that we came back a few nights later.  There was a different bartender behind the bar and, well, the same drinks hardly tasted the same. So much so that I wondered if bartender was even following the proper directions and using the correct ingredients.  I was really disappointed.   We hadn't been back since.  However, a few nights ago we went to a neighboring restaurant.  Once we had finished our dinner at the bar, a couple came in.  The woman sat at the bar and proceeded to talk to one of the men sitting there. The man she came in with started to talk to us.  He introduced himself as an ""ambassador"" for Dante's and handed out $1 drink tickets for the establishment.  He then said that he loved the place and he would never eat anywhere else.  Once he was finished with his pitch, he moved to another table to make another.    I'm not really sure who put him up to this. He did have a stack of coupon cards, so you can make your own decision.  I will say this: we both found it in very poor taste and we will not be returning to Dante's.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Everything was extremely expensive and made me wish we'd suggested leaving the resort grounds for dinner.  There were a number of cooked items and a short list of sushi.  The sushi was good - not fantastic, not horrible, just good.  I won't return unless we'll sucked in again and even then, I'll suggest otherwise.  I understand its a restaurant in a big resort, though, so if you don't feel like navigating Nashville to find someplace else and you've got a few bucks to spare, it'd be worthwhile.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I had been having a Chuys craving so we popped in for lunch. I ordered a sweet tea and fish tacos. My tea came out unsweetened, no problem, mistakes happen and they were busy. When the waiter came back to our table I asked if I could get a sweet tea the next time he came back, he said, ""I tasted it, it was sweet."" (Umm, you drank from my cup?!) I said that I didn't think it was and he said he would bring another. After resolving the drink issue and getting my food I found out that I was given shrimp tacos instead of fish, a problem for me as I share food with my toddler who doesn't eat shrimp. I informed the waiter that my order was incorrect and he once again responded in a way that I felt was unprofessional. ""Oh, I thought you said shrimp."" He brought out some fish tacos and gave us a to-go box for the shrimp tacos which was nice of him. After we paid, left and went home, later that night I decided to eat the shrimp tacos and found a huge lump of fried something inside the tacos which turned out to be a piece of fried chicken with shrimp stuck to it.

The chicken fingers (part of the diner) were the basic minimum and the egg roll another basic minimum with a small amount of cabbage in it.  We had a choice of 3 different rices, so we chose the one the waitress suggested (chow rice).  It was a large portion but minimally a cheaper grade of rice,(sort of bland).  The main dishes were reasonably good. The decor is nice but we were seated about 8 feet from the area where they put the dirty dishes or should I say throw the dishes.

"Good ambiance and friendly service, however, the food was lackluster resulting in the 2 star rating. Caveat this review is based on rolls / items with fish and may not be reflective of the larger menu.  We had the checkerboard roll ($14.5), lobster & tuna flat bread ($15.5), and spider roll ($14) as well as beer and sake. The first item we noticed was that the rice was mushy - given the importance of rice in sushi this is unforgivable. Second in terms of value each item was approximately $2-5 more than I would expect even given the village location - alcohol pricing was competitive. Specifically in terms of value the checkerboard roll was a surprise - minimal amount of fish on top of the roll and no fish inside of the roll.  The happy hour menu looks interesting with a broad selection with pricing that negates our concern on the value. We'll be back to try the happy hour.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The eggs were supposed to be served on an english muffin. I have never seen food plated so poorly except perhaps in a cafeteria. Both the eggs were on top of one half of some sort of biscuit thing, and there was a handful of mediocre breakfast potatoes tossed on the plate. The eggs were actually cooked very well, but I like to really soak up the yoke with whatever bread they are served on, and one half isn't cutting it for two eggs. They were understaffed so the service wasn't so great. Thank god it was a nice day so sitting outside was very pleasant.

He seated us, handed us menus and grabbed us some water, and then all but disappeared for the next 20 minutes. What was he DOING? Like I said before, the restaurant wasn't super busy.   But that's not why he was terrible. No, he was terrible because he did the one thing that bad waiters always do: they turn into douchebags when you ask them for suggestions.  Let me explain. The burger bar has tons of combinations that you can use to put together your own burger. You choose your bun, the burger itself, your cheeses, toppings, etc. Of course, they also have specialty burgers where everything is chosen for you. But who wants to do that when you can play chef for a night and make your own burger?  Okay, so here comes the waiter douchebag part. We asked for some suggestions on what combinations are popular among other guests, and the waiter POINTS TO THE MENU and tells us that the pre-selected options are pretty good. Gee, thanks, hun...I know how to READ. Gah! Maybe I'm weird, but that just burned me up.   But anyway, the food. We ordered the trio of fries as an appetizer: zucchini fries, onion rings, and pickle fries.   For my entree, I made my own burger using a ciabatta bun, buffalo burger, pepperjack cheese, avocado, and jalapeno bacon. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium.   Well, guess what? Our appetizer came out at the same time as our entree. Awesome. Don't you just love when that happens? Poor timing, folks. Poor timing.   The app was pretty terrible to boot. How can you go wrong with deep fried goodness? Well, let me tell you: I bit into the deep fried pickle, and the whole pickle slid out in the first bite, leaving me with a sad empty breading shell. Ew. Same thing happened with the zucchini fries. And the onion rings. I guess this was God's way of telling me not to eat things that are deep fried? It worked. I stopped after a bite of each.   My burger was also lame and sad. It wasn't cooked medium. Instead, it was well-done. *sigh* If a freaking BURGER BAR can't cook my burger right, I've lost hope for all burgers out there. Sorry.   Aside from the meat being overdone, it was dry and bland (probably due to being overcooked!). The toppings were decent, but they didn't add much to the burger. The ciabatta bun was hard and didn't seem fresh.   All in all, this was a complete disaster. Since our meal was comped, we felt obligated to leave a decent tip to our not-so-decent waiter. I'll tell you what -- leaving that $20 tip on the table was HARD.   I'll never be back. Hubert Keller, you should be ashamed of yourself for this abomination.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The only disappointment of our SB weekend.   Zaytoon is beautiful & their food is delicious, so it was a no-brainer to bring our large bachelorette party in for a night of dinner, drinks, and hookah.  While the food & ambiance were of expected caliber, we were really let down by the overall experience.  The management pigeon-holed us into a set menu that balanced out to over $100pp. Unfortunately the price tag does not match the value whatsoever - Zaytoon is perhaps worth $60pp for a full-blown experience, but triple digit prices should be reserved for nicer restaurants.   Everything was plated family style, which definitely made per-person servings pretty tiny. We were also upset to see that they squeezed us into a much smaller table than originally promised.  Overall the whole experience felt rushed & thrown together.  I'm disappointed by the lack of involvement by management, and our waitress was quite inattentive considering our table was dropping over $1100.  Our group had so many excellent experiences with Santa Barbara businesses over our 4-day weekend, but Zaytoon was the only place that seemed purely out to make a buck.  I only recommend Zaytoon for smaller intimate dinners - large groups, beware!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This was my first time in New Orleans, so wanted to try a restaurant that had a great rating. However, when got there we waited for about 30 minutes to get in. I recommend to always call head so that you don't have to wait once you get there. Once we got in and ordered our food the waitress was not as friendly and forgot to bring out my side order of crawfish.   To make matters worse one of the person in my group had to send her food back twice because when it cane out it was cold. Overall the food was just okay nothing too special for Cajun restaurant but I expected better since I was in New Orleans.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
Food here is comparable to all chili's however the service is pretty bad. The kitchen gets held up and can't produce orders out at a decent rate. We waited almost 30min for our food.   Then as they were prepping my boss's burger the spilled the burger on the kitchen table. I hope that table is clean bc they put the burger back together besides all the lettuce that spilled and acted like nothing happened. We were going to ask for a new one but we had a flight to catch and just got our food Togo.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
The prices have gotten CRAZY here! The food is always good but the amounts they are charging for their food is way too high for what you get. Pasta doesn't cost much to make and neither does chicken with a side of potatoes. I think the owners have big heads these days and think they're Mario Bitalli hence why they feel they can charge as much as they do.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Let me preface this by say I NEVER write reviews, food or bad... but after a few days of thinking, I felt I needed to write one.  I went to this restaurant with family and friends to celebrate two birthdays. The one nice thing was that all of the employees we interaacted with were  friendly and nice. The bad part was that the service was  so extremely slow. We ordered food for the kids wirh our drink order. Then we ordered our appetizers when the drinks were served   The waiter didn't take our entree order until after we  finished our appetizers. Anytime we would need  something, like napkins or refill of drinks, the waiter was nowhere  to  be found. I assume they were short staffed, or that they have employees who  get frazzled easily.   The food was mediocre at best. We ordered the chicken Parmesan  as well as a pizza and pasta and meatballs. I had the pasta aNd meatballs, and it was just eh.. thankfully, I had the company I did, and thankfully we had nice people serving us, otherwise this would have turned into a complete bummer of a nIght.   If you're looking for  eh food at a decent price and nice people to  serve you then you should go here. If not then carry on.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"We live in the Mogul/Verdi/Somersett area and are dying to have more choices of good places to dine close by.  So, having been long time fans of El Adobe in Reno, and having gone a few times to El Posada Real in Sparks (all previously affiliated with Abel), we were thrilled and excited to have a new place to go, opened up by someone familiar and obviously experienced.    We went right after the place opened--trying to overlook the tacky leftover sportsbar decor (that I hated when I visited the place before it was Abel's) I was willing it to be good...I WANTED it to be good...and was sad when I found it to be just ok.  Some time later, thinking maybe it was just me and really wanting a guinea pig before I went back, I recommended the place to a friend (without telling them how I really felt), and they reported the same.  We haven't been back.  I WANT to go back, but I don't want to risk having another just ok experience when I know I can go someplace else and have a great experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"It is with great sorrow that this review is written. Christopher's was a great place for Sam and I to go after tango on Wednesdays. We joked that we were becoming regulars...but we liked the idea. The food was consistent, the service acceptable and their Wednesday wine special was perfect timing for our schedule.  With our Wednesday night commitment in Wayne a thing of the past...we decided to take the drive from Media to Christopher's last night (in the rain) for the sake of the good ole days. The server who used to say ""got it"" all the time was now dressed in the garb of management and the staff huddled around the kitchen doing nothing much.  Be it the peter principle at work or simply a bad night for the place...Sam and I contemplated walking out after sitting with menus for over 10 minutes with no one to greet us. The manager walked by 3 times and never once noticed our empty table and folded menus. (He was an attentive, capable server before.) Eventually someone came by and asked ""Has your server been here?"" Well, of course not, we don't even know who our server is. The person who was not our server took a drink order...and then we were left alone again.  When our drinks arrived with our assigned and previously missing server, he put them on the table and said ""Are you all ready?"" Yes, in fact I was ready to tell him how little I thought of him, that he should be ashamed to call himself a server and had he learned not an ounce of social skill simply from being human? (I held my tongue, not wanting to act as old as I was feeling at that moment.) But really, he was rude, gruff and not at all apologetic for his tardiness. In fact, he seemed annoyed we were there.  He took our order. No water, no bread, no further contact ensued. Sam's drink was not to his liking...but there was no one to talk to about it. The ""got it"" manager looked scared of making contact with anyone, even his staff as they freely did what they pleased: nothing.  How can you run a restaurant and not have the desire, ability and sense to take note of each table in the place? To anticipate the needs of your customers, to note the stages of dining, how attentive are your servers being. There is no excuse for bad service when more than half the staff is standing chatting (on their cell phones) doing nothing to contribute to the success of the restaurant.  Needless to say, I think our love affair with Christopher's came to grinding halt last night. We left disappointed and saddened by the loss. We are sure our hand written comment card was discarded...why would a server pass on such information? Why would a new manager risk letting his boss see the comment?  And we really like their cobia special. It is the best bargain on the menu. Crab and scallion risotto, grilled scallions on top, a mild, flavorful grilled cobia fish on top. I can still recommend that...but perhaps take-out is a better option.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This place was built up too much in my opinion. People said it was so, so great and it was just so, so. I had the beef taco plate and the wife had a tamale plate.

"I ONLY leave a review when something is next-level amazing or disappointing. Until today, that amounted to a 2014 review of the best taco shop ever in Denver (RIP) and a 2015 review of a pawn shop that ripped me off in Houston.  Six years later, I add a third review. Ordered bibimbap for delivery. My bulgogi was mostly lettuce with about 1/2 ounce of meat. For $17. I took a picture because it was almost unbelievable. Equivalent of a pawn shop ripoff.   Adding a star because at least the meat had flavor and the bean sprouts were okay.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This restaurant is overrated in general and here on Yelp. The entree prices really aren't that bad, but the drink prices are ridiculous-- over $12 for a mixed drink.

"I was hoping to have the same experience as the previous customers, but unfortunately, the food left much to be desired.  My wife got me three flour tacos at 5pm on weekday [dinner rush]: chicken, Pastor, and chopped beef. Their tortillas are good, and the chopped beef was good (tastes just like Manwich- in a good way), but the mouth feel was chewy. Pastor was seasoned really well (reminded me of Steak-n Shake Chili- good.), but it was salty and chewy. The chicken was extremely salty, and chewy, and three people confirmed it tasted like teriyaki.  Another bummer was their chips and salsa. The chips were very oily, and salt would not stick to them, so it was hard to eat the salsa. The salsa was too hot for me anyway (and I usually enjoy hot stuff).  Not everything was bad. The tortillas seemed fresh, and the guacamole, and pico de gallo were tasty.  I'll give them another chance to earn my business. Everyone deserves a second chance.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"2 stars from a texan who knows good mexican food... Overpriced mediocre food! Carne asada was tender but lacking flavor...with a tiny bit of rice and beans that were average at best.

"I've been to two other Smashburgers before but this location in Oro Valley was not a good experience.  Ordering went fine but as I sat to wait for my food I noticed so many unsanitarry activites by the staff.  A girl was making a shake and took a dirty cup out of a small fridge to measure.  After pouring the finished shake into a to go cup, she wiped the edge of the tin cup with her hand and then proceeded to lick her fingers.  Then reached for the to go cup, put a lid on it and handed it to the customer.  Yuch.  She then ran into the back room with the tin cup and just her manner made me think she took the leftovers to drink.  I guess that's okay with management because the supervisor would drink his can of energy drink from the food prep table between sending out orders.  And, a staff's soda drink is also on another food prep table.  The holder with the straws, utencils, lemons, etc.  looked sticky and dirty.  Clearly not wiped down on a daily basis.    I won't recommend this location to friends given what i saw today.  Yuch.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I come to Green Eggs at least once a month or every other month. And recently I have noticed a decline in the food and service. This is first time I have ever written a review for them and my most recent visit 2/15/18 was very disappointing.   First I would like to say whenever someone asks me where to go for brunch I always recommend Green eggs café, always! Even over Honey's and Sabrina's I vouch for them first. I love their brunch specials and they have a great variety of options for anyone (may that be veggie lovers, vegans and carnivores ).  I am an industry worker. I am a sous chef (I have front of house and back of house experience). With over 3 years of experience in breakfast restaurants I am well aware of how breakfast spots operate. Breakfast should take less than 20 minutes, it is the quickest thing to make. Unfortunately not for Green Eggs.    My friend and I were seated between 12:10pm -12:15pm on a Friday, lunch is typically busy. It was a reasonable wait of 30 minutes, no biggie. After we seated our very nice sever Ryan greeted us accordingly in less than 5 minutes after we sat down.   As soon as she brought us an ice bucket and glasses for our sparkling beverage we ordered right away. It's approaching 1pm, we've seen two other tables receive their food when we were seated  before these tables. I was very confused and getting upset. It should not take 30 minutes for breakfast!   About 12:50pm we get our food, but not all at once. We received our food in 2-3 minute increments, I'm like seriously. For as long as we waited everything should have came out all at once and no apology from the food runner about the delay. Our food runner dropped everything off like like a delivery guy, no personal engagement with negative attitude.   My friend ordered the creme brûlée French toast with a side of potatoes and bacon. I ordered a waffle with a side of berry compote and vanilla sauce that's normally served with the creme brûlée French toast. And a egg plater with bacon and potatoes; eggs scrambled with cheddar.   My friends food was fine, I was super underwhelmed by my waffle and my egg platter. My waffle was soft when I got it and less than 5 minutes after eating it my waffle turned into a rock (I tapped it on the plate when I showed my server, her jaw dropped). The berry compote that accompanied my waffle was a frozen berry medley that tasted like the freezer and it was given to me cold. Seriously Green Eggs, you can't toss some fresh berries together, laziness at its best.   I think this is my last visit to Green eggs, our server Ryan was a sweetheart! She's the reason I didn't rate this one star, if I could give half a star I would.   P.S. There policy about not removing items of the bill that a guest doesn't like is ridiculous. My 10 years in the industry I have NEVER seen such a thing!  Good luck and best wishes to this place, they have lost my business",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I've been here 3x and tried something different each time.  Food has been ok, not as tasty as I've had in other BBQ places but still good.  Sides are really good.  Service has been pretty quick too. 2 stars because food is average and June 6th health inspection reported 18 violations.

"I used to love this place - but it has essentially become a fast food joint.  My daughter and I went for dinner last night - we had appetizers, dinner and a dessert and the check was in our table in 45 mins.  If I'm going out for dinner - I don't want to be rushed by an army of wait staff removing plates and glasses the very second you're done.  Also got the distinct impression the food was already cooked and they were just reheating stuff.  A fact confirmed by the waiter when he told us their ""signature"" carrot cake is cooked, covered in a butter sugar mix and frozen and then microwaved.  Really??? I'm paying $8 for microwave cake?? The calamari was ok - a little greasy and over cooked so the batter was falling off.  The pork loin was drowning in a plate of goopy sauce.  The Paris style steak was cooked well although the French fries were a little undercooked.  It was $100 with tip for two ...and we both felt rushed and that it definitely wasn't worth it.

This was one of my fAvorite places to dine. Ate brunch there on Sunday next day i went to take my son out for breakfast to find out they're not open until 11. Which was ok either way we grabbed a burrito at seis taqueria. We were going to eat quickly we picked a small dirty table in the court yard which I cleaned with stuff from seis napkins n sanitizer.  After doing this we were approached by the manager from AK who told us we can't sit at that table its only for AK clients. What is the big deal they were not even open for business.  I explained to the manager if they were open WE would have dined with AK. However it's before 10am they don't open until 11. He said no exceptions he was rude and walked away.

"Staff quickly took our order. I asked for eggs Benedict, but asked to omit the ham. They did bring my order without the meat, but also they didn't put hollandaise sauce on it. I asked the waiter to please bring it back and add hollandaise, which he did.    My lady friend ordered crab Benedict. When I asked her opinion of her breakfast, she said ""it was nasty"".  There was a piece in hers that she had pulled out of her mouth which had crab leg shell. She asked for a spicy Bloody Mary, but it wasn't spicy at all, and she had to add hot sauce to it.  My male friend commented that his had browns weren't crispy whatsoever and we're more like potato mush.  He pulled out something he almost broke his tooth on which when we all examined it we determined it was a bone shard.   My dish was pretty tasty, once they brought it back and added the hollandaise sauce. The hash browns had a nice flavor but definitely should have been a little crisper. There was also one giant hunk of hash browns within that pile on my dish that was rock-hard in a clump and I swear I almost broke a tooth when I tried to chew it before I realized it was a hard clump.   From where I sat beside the kitchen door, in my view was a garbage can leaving up against the area where the cashier is. The floor under and around that garbage pail, and the wall behind it, looked like it hasn't seen a mop or been wiped down in literal eternity.

And, while very tasty, had a very small portion,  and also....no andouille....and this is what I really was craving.  So, $21 was a little high for what I got. The spring greens salad had a very strange and strongly acidic dressing which tasted like it was a vinegar paste with a lot of pepper and other spices, but not poppy seed dressing as on the menu. It was not even slightly sweet which would have been excellently paired with the julienned pears.

If you order a glass of wine, by default the option for an extra half glass is checked for an extra $5 or so. Then before you know what's happening you have a $15 dollar glass (full pour) of cheap wine. The Philly cheesesteak was good, but when the check came my money manager spouse noticed the total (all computerized) was $2.00 off. No big deal, but he was just curious how it could have possibly calculated in error. The waiter seemed uninterested and mentioned that it ""was just two dollars"" but would re-do it.

Being that a lot of places are byob and if not may have a weird menu for some in the group.  Obviously we went to yelp and stumbled across this place.

Loved the open kitchen and brick ovens firing definitely an inviting feeling and had me stoked to get to the table.  Server hit us with a 15 second greet which wasn't necessarily a bad thing just hard to order wine or apps so we had to tell her to come back.  Came back about 30 seconds later asking if we were ready.  I like the hustle cause I was hungry but come on.  We order apps.  30 seconds later she came back.  Lol please chill.  Same happened about 2 more times before we order.    We ordered the antipasti and the rice balls. Antipasti was good but none of us ate soft cheese so we asked for two hard choices. We ended up ordering a pecorino and some other one per the servers recommendation. the cheese she suggested  turned out to be soft and pretty gross honestly.  Rice balls were phenomenal just tiny as could be and only 5 in an order seemed a bit like a ripoff.  For dinner I ordered the sausage baked ziti. It was in an Alfredo sauce and layered with mozzerella.  It was very good very cheesy just a little small for what you'd expect.  My girlfriend got the gnocchi which were fresh and light, still on the small side.  Looking around at my girlfriends moms and dads plates they almost licked theirs clean.    Biggest qualm with everything was the fact we were nonstop rushed the entire time.  Idk if our server worked at IHOP before or a different style of restaurant but a place like this should NOT be forcing you in and out in an hour.  Reservation was 5:15 we were almost out at 5.  Honestly it was slightly comical and a bit distracting.  My girlfriend made it a point to emphasize that she was still working MULTIPLE times.  She was sweet as could be but come on honey give me some time to breathe and digest.  Like I said it was 5 o'clock not 630 in the middle of your rush.  There's no reason your mother in laws topic of convo is how relentless you are relax.  My girlfriend who's good for a bottle to herself didn't even finish a full glass of wine.  We were a 150 table give us some respect.

"The food is really good, I thoroughly enjoy it. I'm giving a 2-star rating for the seating.  Everything from the seating policy to the arrangements to the distribution of tables is a disaster.  If it's a busy day which it usually is, good luck. The problem is many-fold.  1) The amount of 4-tops to 2-tops is so out of balance. I would say the ratio has to be way over 80% that cater to tables of four. Also there's nothing prohibiting a lone diner from grabbing a 4-top which adds to the issue.  2) The wall signs are up asking folks not to save tables. This happens anyway, so if you place your order on the line and pay way before someone who just walked in, then you and your party try and follow the rules and get hung out to dry by those who don't care.  3) The end result of this set-up is what I refer to as the shopping mall parking lot syndrome. Combating groups use the ""hover"" method where they will stand close-ish to an occupied table they want (or who they see is close to finishing up) and grab the table for themselves at the right time.  There is no hope for you if you are a party of one. You can't hover, you can't ""get in line"" to even hover...you just have to get lucky. I waited 10 minutes after paying for my order with my food visibly staring at me from its tray, just looking for a seat. There it was ""dying in the window"" until the kind waitress offered to wrap things up for folks who decided they've had enough and just ended up getting it to go.  I elected to wrap my stuff up and I ended up eating my meal in my car in the parking lot.  Bottom line is they just don't have enough inside space to meet the demand.  If I come here I just won't plan to sit inside, it's too difficult a process!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"So a group of us decide to go out for the Birthdays in the month of May.  It just so happens that on this fine afternoon, it was actually my birthday.  We had a party of 10.  9 women and 1 lone guy.  Guess who paid?  ;)  Anyway, I ordered a chicken barbeque salad - hold the Onion & BBQ Sauce and put the dressing (Ranch)on the side.  We had gotten to the restaurant about 11:45am.   We didn't get served our lunches until at least 12:30p.  The first time it came it, I noticed that it had BBQ sauce on it.  I could have dealt with that, but as I delved deeper, I found the onions.  Onions make me retch, so to save my fellow diner's any grossness, I sent it back.  About 15 minutes later the manager comes out and says, they made it with no onions, but put BBQ sauce on it, so they are making it a third time.  (Everytime they made it, they had to grill a new Chicken Breast for the top of the salad, evidently)   By the time it got out to me, I told them to put it in a ToGo container.  It was after 1 o'clock when I finally got my lunch - TO GO - and was able to leave the buiilding.   Happy Birthday to me!  Two Stars is a stretch for this particular dining experience, but I know they are not this bad normally. Bad Day!   I would give them another chance.

"First time to the Ina Restaurant. Wasn't impressed. No A/C. They has a swamp cooler inside to help keep the temperatures down. It wasn't sweltering but it made it very humid. Tropical humid. It's the Monsoon season so running a swamp cooler when it's humid outside only adds to the humidity. It was noticeable with the chips that weren't dry and crunchy but dull and semi stale like. Salt shakers were caking up. I assume they have the A/C off either to save money not running it or not fixing it. It must be a hard time for this location due to Ina road work and closures. With that said I also think that is causing other issues as well. Cleanliness is a problem here. Either they are short staffed or under managed. Dirty rags hanging in bar chairs, filthy and coated Point of Sale stations, dirty floors. All in all not a pleasant visit. Didn't give them a 1 star rating because I think some of the problems are lower customers because of Ina Road construction. Won't go back until all the construction is over and they pick up on their business.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I wasn't crazy about The Office, for a few reasons: the atmosphere & the food. Service was okay on the front end, but the food was seriously lacking. We went on a busy weekday and it was insanely LOUD! We settled into a booth and my co-worker ordered a crab cake and I ordered the ribeye sandwich special.   The crab cake was raw inside and had to be sent back- the hostess and waitress were very apologetic, and the took it off her bill, which was much appreciated- and gave another to go. However, when she got it home, she realized that one was raw as well. She attempted to bake it but it did not ever solidify.   My food fared slightly better. I ordered the ribeye sandwich; it was fully cooked but it was very rubbery (it looked like it had been boiled, not grilled), and the bun it was served on was quite soggy. I ended up taking it off the bun and ate it with a knife and fork, but there was no silverware on the table so I had to ask for it.   Minor inconveniences, but the food was the deal-breaker for me. I will likely try it again, with co-workers or friends, but I will definitely avoid the crabcake.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

But their Teriyaki chicken was bad. It use to be breaded and delicious, now it's plain and over cooked. Service wasn't great either, until near the end of the meal, when a new girl came on and she was good.

"Wanted this place to be at least good since it's convenient for us. Have tried it twice now. Never again. Both times were sub par. Ordered to go this last time. Took it home and found the nigiri were TINY. Small rice and small fish. We're talking smaller than any of the ""all you can eat"" places give you, but this wasn't all you can eat. Wife ordered a spider roll which they said had real crab. Indeed it did- only it was just 20% real crab with 80% of the FAKE crab. Simply false advertising. My salmon skin roll was a mix of cooked salmon and salmon skin. Something about it was off, but maybe it was just that by the time I got to it the rest of the meal had tuned me off. Fish quality was ""OK"", so not 1*. Will stick with Rickshaw and especially Oceano (great sushi. pricey, but not bad with 20% locals discount).

"Just went for the second time (business convention meeting and dinner).  Was here couple years ago, and same type of  lethargic, unhappy service.  Charbroiled oysters are good as usual, but something about eating them in a dated, hotel lobby, with no atmosphere is just not the same.  The first time I went I tried to get them to put on a Pelicans game, the waitress had no idea who the Pelicans are.  So I go to the bar and the bartender who instantly got hostile and had to get a manager who had the authority to the bar tv's.   He is also clueless that the city of New Orleans has an NBA team....so I gave up.  I like Drago's in bucktown, but this one is not for locals.

Giving this place two stars. I gave this place three chances to get the rolls right. I got the spicy tuna and Alaskan roll combo and the spicy tuna roll had so much tempura crunch there was nothing in the roll but all crunch and a small tiny amount of spicy tuna mixture. Also I hate crunch so no where in the menu it says its a spicy tuna crunch roll. Color was off and did not seem fresh at all. Alaskan roll same way. The amount of avocado was shocking compared to the tiny strip of salmon that was in the roll. I had seaweed salad and I don't know why cucumbers were mixed in. Pad Thai was okay. Had better at gummlai Thai down the street. Chinese food was okay. Comparable to the mall food courts but much cheaper at the mall. If your gonna cut corners atleast do it sneaky dont be so obvious with it. Hope this place improves I know it's new.

"Damn. This was one of the most intensely frustrating service experiences of my life. Absolute disaster. Background: we had a large party that arrived at different times, and two people did switch seats at one point. I realize this makes it tough on a server but our experience was ridiculous. We asked for several separate checks from the beginning, which she said was no problem and we explained the seat switch when it happened.  It was hard to get our server's attention in the middle of the afternoon on a Tuesday. We got several wrong drinks and had to repeat orders more than once on a couple of occasions. Our server didn't know the answer to basic questions like ""hey do you guys have shuffleboard here?"" And disappeared for 15 minutes to ask a manager. Then we got our final bill. Wow. Even though two people who had requested a separate check had already paid and left, the entire table's bill was given to us to sort out. We had to go through the tedious process of splitting our own checks PLUS deducting everything that had already been paid for on our own. We were all disgruntled by the end. The two people that did manage to get their check separated had an extra beer on their bill. The server acknowledged it was a mistake but didn't offer to remove it an at that point we all just wanted to get out of there so they paid it and left.   I  am certainly not eager to get back here for the terrible service and mediocre beer. I will say one thing that was enjoyed by everyone was the tacos that were also 1/2 off for taco Tuesday.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"At this point I have tried 3 Dot Dash because of the constant recommendations and colorful reviews, and unfortunately my experience has not been as positive as I had hoped for.    The first time I eat here was honestly enough for me to never try them again. So in between meetings I ordered some food and had it sent to me via Uber eats.  I got the Southwestern Chick'N ( Add Cheez Wiz & Vegan Bacon) + No Animal Style fries.    The sandwich just wasn't good at all in my opinion.  The fries were not great either. For me it wasn't just one thing that I could pinpoint as the issue.  The food was cold. The presentation was horrendous and the taste was lackluster. The fries were something I had hoped to enjoy and even they were horrible. I believe this was mainly due to the fact that they were just drowned in sauce. I had hope that this poor experience could be partially attributed to the fact that I ordered the food via Uber eats.    The second time I ordered the Fat Mac and fries . This time the food order was much better but still significantly missed the mark for me. My main complaint is that the food was really cold.  Which for me speaks to the quality along with presentation still being an issue. It had really good flavor from what I could gather it just was not what I expected it to be.

"I would say you really have to be careful when coming to this place to eat inside. It was my 1st time and lots and lots of flies. I'm not kidding, just didn't feel comfortable at all dining inside. Hopefully they take care of this pestilence, the cashier who is a male doesn't bother to ask people if it's our first time. We did not know what to expect and with the hunger we carried we ordered 2 sides (potatoes) (chips & Guacamole), 2 of their big burritos, one order of 6 tacos, and one more order of their Guadalajara tacos, along with 3 drinks. One Jarrito, one Horchata water, & Hibiscus water.  All of these for $ 89.69. We actually didn't think it was worth it but it was our 1st time. Personally husband and I just didn't feel like their Chorizo meat is good. But what disappointed my husband is the lack of communication to us the clients on informing us how much onions they load all the food. Just tons and tons of Purple onions. Be careful if ur not interested in eating a colossal amount of purple onions. Tortillas were not our cup of tea. Street tacos were ok. But the rest of the food we order wasn't what we expected. Not bad if ur ordering to go just street tacos but they didn't even put enough rice on our burritos and only a couple of black beans. We were expecting pinto beans.

"After a $96.00 meal, I have to say that the highlight was the $3 corn on the cob - covered in chili powder and lime - it was THE SHIT!  The margaritas we ordered were so so weak - it was pathetic.  The guava was slightly less sweet than the mango margarita, which tasted just like Kerns nectar straight from the can.  After expressing our disappointment to our server, he recommended we order our next round as ""doubles"" which tasted how a regular margarita should taste - sad that we really had to pay the price for a decent margarita.  The nachos were delicious - each chip in the pile was perfectly cheesed!  Not like other restaurants where the top layer is divine goodness and the rest plain tortilla chips.  We ordered the fiesta platter which may have been a mistake - first off, our server told us it was six tacos plus some sides.... it was six tacos plus six quesadillas plus sides plus some other fried chimichanga nonsense - who knows?  Wish we had gotten the short rib enchiladas instead - would have preferred quality of quantity.    The food was not worth the price tag - we will probably not return.

"LOVEPIZZA seems to have taken Edmonton's ""foodie"" crowd by storm. Almost all the reviews I've read have been positive and with a lack of quality pizza options in town, I was happy to hear things were going well so far. We decided to give them a try for dinner Thursday evening and arrived around 6pm. It didn't feel busy but there was a constant flow of people coming in and out, with most people taking their pizzas to go.  I have no idea how this used to be a Planet Beach Tanning salon but I will give Lovepizza credit where credits due. They've made the space their own with a slick black and white look. The layout is spacious and gives off a casual, laid-back vibe. It's not fancy here but geared to be a grab something quick and tastier than your crappy fast food alternatives. Guess that makes sense as one of Lovepizza's co-owner also owns all the Press'd Sandwiches spots.  Here's where things got weird - we were waiting in line to order so I decided to take a few pictures. I take one photo and this one lady, who I originally assumed was the co-owner (but am pretty sure was just a worker) says you're not allowed to take any photos unless you specifically ask her. What?!? That's never happened ever. Okay, technically once in Calgary but that place specifically had signs up saying no photos allowed. That's different. Either way, I obliged so if you want to see photos, check out a few other reviews (here or here).  - Holy Shiitake ($11.95) - truffle parmesan sauce, fior di latte, roasted mushroom blend, caramelized onion and fresh arugula. This one was our least favourite. The mushrooms were bland, almost tasteless and I didn't get a hint of the truffle parmesan sauce. You know it's bad when you have to constantly drizzle chili oil and add chili flakes to give the pizza any real flavour.  - Pie on The Fly ($11.95) - truffle parmesan sauce, quattro formaggi, prosciutto and fresh arugula. I liked this one the best but wow, talk about cheaping out on the toppings. There was barely any prosciutto on it. Seriously, not impressed especially when I think back to how generous Spinelli's prosciutto arugula pizza was.  - BBLT ($11.95) - tangy tomato sauce, fior di latte, Irvings farm bacon, back bacon, fresh arugula and cherry tomatoes. J liked this one but I wasn't a fan of their sauce. The tanginess didn't compliment the rest of the ingredients. We both agreed that the traditional caputo ""00"" dough that they use is great - everything else was average.  For the price, I'm not sure why everyone's raving about how cheap it is. Sure, you can save $5.00 the first visit for signing up for their loyalty program - which my buddy used to get a Grizzly Paw beer ($5.99) with his meal. But if we had only ordered one pizza each, we would have still been hungry. Likely hangry. We ate three pizzas between the two of us and had no leftovers.   J said he's in no rush to come back and said this place reminded him of a ""Quizno's if Quizno's were to serve pizza"". This coming from a guy who will eat everything - guess I've been spoiling him too much with all the ethnic hole in the wall type places.

I tried scraping it off the top, but I just couldn't get rid of the taste. Even the potatoes were saturated with the lemon flavor in addition to being overcooked. I asked my wife, who just happens to be Greek, to taste it and she agreed that an otherwise perfectly good fillet of salmon had been ruined. She wasn't all that impressed with her meal either.

"DON'T DO IT! This is close to the house, and we usually go to Little Toyko because it's in the same area. This time we decided to try something new. Bad decision. The decor and ambiance of this place is awful. Four-top tables everywhere, no booths, nothing cozy. Fine. We'll sit in the middle of the restaurant and feel awkward. We can move past that.   The one redeeming quality of this place is the seared tuna avocado salad. It is too bad too because the roll we ate after that left a bad taste in our mouth. The salmon on the Hot & Spicy roll was super thick and chewy. In fact, it felt like we were chewing on a chicken's tendon. And it didn't taste fresh. GROSS! It also had lettuce in it, and that wasn't listed on the menu. We weren't expecting the crunchy texture.  I suggest if you want something in the immediate area, take your ass down the street to Little Tokyo.

"Ok I will provide this review with the understanding that we're still in the middle of a pandemic and that I'm well aware that restaurants are doing everything in their power to keep service and quality at the highest level possible.  That being said, I consider myself to be on this continued search for the best BBQ throughout the USA and having eaten probably more than my personal physician would like me to.   So let's begin. I usually can tell how good any rib is by tasting it without sauce which is exactly what I did. The rib quality was good, meaty with just the right amount of fat to give it hopefully some flavor. Well that flavor just never happened. The texture of the meat was mushy as if the ribs had been boiled prior to smoking. The rub was bland and added virtually no flavor. The sauce definitely helped to get thru this meal which is another sign of bad BBQ. I give the ribs a grade of D.  The baked beans were really bad. They had no smoke taste or sweetness and reminded me of Campbell's Baked Beans from a can. The beans get a solid grade of F.  Finally the coleslaw. The color was as tho it had been sitting out in open air. It just looked dead. Cabbage was crunchy tho. The taste on the other hand was marginal at best. It needed more vinegar and more sweetness. The coleslaw gets a D.  To have so many locations in the STL area I expected the quality to better but I've seen restaurants grow and their quality subsequently decline.   The service was excellent tho.   Overall this rib plate is the worst I've ever had in STL.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Staff was very friendly and attentive but unfortunately the food fell flat. I had the Cuban which was inedible. The bread, ham and pulled pork tasted off.

"I usually stick to my favorite spot for Chinese food, but tonight I didn't feel like driving far so I ordered food to go from here.   Very disappointing. The food looked great, except for the Orange Chicken, which was soggy.  The House Pan Fried Noodles were Super bland. I couldn't taste any flavor and the amount of protein they put on the noodles were really skimpy. I don't usually eat orange chicken, I ordered it for my kids and they didn't like it.  I tasted it and could tell why. The chicken flour coating was thick and soggy.  The dish should have a balanced amount of sweet and savory. The dish was prepared really salty.  Hate to say this, but I can make better Orange Chicken from a package bought at Trader Joe's.  The Won Ton Soup was decent.  I wouldn't rave about it.

"disappointing. first time there so maybe i expected better after hearing all the great things about it. so we went there for new years eve dinner. waited over 45 minutes even though we had reservations. sigh. the place was so dark we had to use our phones to see the menu. the special new years eve menu wasn't very special at all, in tiny print and everything on it was quite expensive. so not off to a good start. not being familiar with the menu, it was suggested that i try the dinner deal that came with soup, entree & dessert. so after a really long time, out came what should have been lobster bisque yet it was a small cup of yellow puree that tasted like bland squash. I asked our server and she said yes that was the lobster bisque. Um, ok. sigh. Now i am no food connoisseur however i do know what lobster bisque should taste like and that was not it. so being seriously hungry at this point, i drank down my tiny cup of yellow mushy broth and hoped for better results with the main course. sigh. the onion encrusted salmon was way more onion than salmon and after chipping away all the crust, what was found underneath was a tiny, dry sad little piece of fishy-tasting salmon. you'd think it would have at least tasted like onion, right? or maybe even salmon but no, another disappointment. I just so happy my tiny fish-like entree came with a nice-sized pile of mashed red potatoes. the rum cake that came for dessert was ok although dry and nothing special. pretty much left the place almost as hungry as I was when i got there.  so the highlight of dinner: the potatoes were delicious.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I went to eat here last night after watching the balloon race from my friend's Forest Park view apartment balcony. My companions and I decided we wanted to go out for a nice dinner.   Luciano's looked like a good option, considering its reasonable prices and Clayton location.   Outdoor seating was a plus (except that I always forget that I'm a mosquito magnet - but I only got two bites last night).   The company was the best part of the meal (as it should be). I can't really give any more compliments to the restaurant because there aren't many more positive things I can say about it.   After we were seated, we waited almost ten minutes for silverware and menus - not terrible yet, since I'm with friends and we can amuse ourselves.   The waitress kept missing our table to check on us.   I had to ask, twice, for my water glass to be filled.   After ordering, our meals took over 30 minutes to reach us. Nothing complicated, either. The food was a little better than mediocre, a good portion for the prices, but it definitely wasn't worth the wait.

Surprisingly, when the soup was on the side, the noodle tasted better, but the bowl of soup is really small. When my soup almost ran out, I asked more for a bowl of soup.  Then she unfriendly told me that ""next time if you want more soup, just put it in the bowl. This is the way we do""   I was upset. just a bowl of soup... why didn't she just bring it for me right away and charge me for this?

"We went to Frank and Helens for dinner and the dining room was pretty empty. The service was friendly, but very slow, especially considering there weren't many tables left. A few minor mistakes (wrong entree served, forgetting to bring napkins, etc.) are understandable in my book, but some things are not. For example, we all had dessert, but our silverware was removed with our dinner plates, so we had to wait for the waitress to finally return to bring us some forks while we stared at our dessert for several minutes. It took 14 minutes to get a glass of wine. Like I said, it was just extremely slow service and the dining room was not full.   The food...okay, this is where it goes from a 4-star review to a 2-star review. My dad was so excited to go to Frank and Helens because they're apparently legendary for their great food. He ordered fettuccine alfredo -- a pretty basic dish, pretty difficult to mess up. I ordered cannelloni. The red sauce on the cannelloni tasted a lot like Ragu -- it wasn't very flavorful and tasted very...is synthetic the right word? It tasted like it was from a can or a jar, not fresh. The cannelloni were described as being filled with cheese, meat, and spinach, but it was clear that these were not fresh because all these ingredients were (I'm guessing) pre-mixed together into a meat paste consistency. I was expecting ground meat, fresh spinach leaves, and cheese, but there was no cheese inside the cannelloni except it seemed like it was mixed into the meat paste, which had wilty strings of spinach (probably from a can) mixed throughout. It was not disgusting to eat, but it was not what I was expecting from Frank and Helens (maybe from a Fazolis this would be the norm, but we were expecting food that reflected the price, and this was not even coming close).   The fettuccine alfredo was hands down disgusting. It was very disappointing.  The noodles weren't quite al dente so they were actually very stiff and chewy. The white sauce was just that -- white sauce. Absolutely no flavor whatsoever. My dad was pretty bummed about it and ended up switching plates with my sister and eating her chicken parmesean, which she did not want because she didn't like the red sauce (and I couldn't blame her). It was completely flavorless and we put a lot of salt and pepper into it, but it didn't really help. It was embarrassingly bad.   Bottom line is that we were pretty disappointed because Frank and Helens is an establishment that has been around since the fifties in St. Louis. We thought this place stayed in business because they had high standards and delicious food, but unfortunately it seems like it's more about the nostalgia now than the actual experience. It would probably be wise for them to limit their menu to their few specialties (chicken and pizza) and forego the high-dollar Italian food they aren't pulling off.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
It could be a 2.5 but it's closer to a 2 than a 3. I had the$10 lunch deal. I asked what was a signature sandwich or soup and was recommended the pastrami and chicken noodle soup.  Both were very bland. Arby's has more flavor in the meat. The chicken was nice in the soup but there was no flavor. Plus bow tie pasta just doesn't cut it in soup.

"This is the 4th hot chicken place I've tried since moving to Sumner Co. 6 months ago. I've been to Moores in H-ville/ Pepperfire/Slow Burn and now Helen's. I just got the breast quarter..no sides. I got the ""hot"" version. It was ok flavor-wise but the piece was a bit small and light on meat..but it was just $6. It was cooked a bit longer than the other three places. Had some dark spots indicative of being cooked in a cast iron pan as opposed to a deep fryer. Not sure if that's the case. There's zero ambience here...Slow Burn up the street has much more room and a better set up to eat-in. I'd rate this the 4th best out of the ones I've tried with Slow Burn on Myatt Drive the clear winner. That being said if you only have a few bucks and need a hot chicken fix this might fit the bill.

"We have enjoyed San Nicola for many years and love their food. The Bar is a nice place to meet friends and the drinks are made well and reasonable. Black ink linguini with caramelized onions and crab meat is delightful, as is the Veal Braciola alla Barese. The fish dishes are usually fresh and prepared as stated, especially the Red snapper filet, mussels, scallops and herbs.   The reason I only gave 2 stars is due to the fact that they started to charge $2 extra if you wanted any other pasta than Penne, which is served with all their entrees.  This now puts this restaurant in the ""convenience to the proprietor vs. made to order for the patron"" category, which is a major step down in customer service as far as we are concerned. Another pet peeve is not leaving the Parmesan Cheese bowl on the table. It's provided only when asked and when you can get their attention. These two things are annoying and will keep us from returning for quite awhile. A shame really, as the food and service is above average for a local established restaurant.

"Well we have been going to Joey B's for a while. Inconsistency is their specialty. I personally recommend staying away from take out there is always something that goes wrong when we do take out. We have had great experiences here and the food can be amazing, but it is can be terrible too. I feel the only time they really pay attention and make food great is when you came in after a bad experience and complained. They forgot to put in our take-out order, and my husband ended up waiting an extra hour. The next time the manager did buy our meal, and make sure everything was perfect. The chicken Modega was amazing. My husband's chicken spedini was great, but then we go two weeks later, and we receive lackluster food. My chicken Modega plate is flooded with sauce and the asparagus is cold. We decided to stay away after that experience. Last night we wanted something quick on the way home. So we ordered take out. Not the worst things happened but it's the annoying attentions to detail that are a little aggravating. No dressing for the salad, and no butter for the bread. Being busy on the inside doesn't make your takeout customers less important. That's how you are treated for takeout it seems. I have had a love hate relationship with Joey B's, but I'll think twice before going there ever again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I went here for lunch with my husband. He ordered the shrimp and grits which was okay. I had the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and cole slaw as my sides. The mashed potatoes came out with gravy (I ordered it without). They took it back and changed it quickly but the new potatoes came out cold (didn't want to send it back twice). The coleslaw was a little weird. Too much mustard. The service was good. My biggest complaint though, are the many dead bugs stuck to lamps or the squished mosquito on the Elvis picture. I would not go back again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Salty, salty, salty.  I was really hoping to like this place, but today I ordered a chicken salad Panini, which actually wasn't even a Panini now that I think about it.  I was expecting a Panini which is grilled on top and bottom.  But this was just a normal sandwich.  Yet this is not even my biggest complaint.  The worst offense is the salt...it is drowning in salt!!!  Why would chicken salad need this much salt?!!  Not only that, but I ordered this as take-out and there was bacon on the sandwich which is NOT listed on the menu ingredients!  What if I was not able to eat pork?!  This is absolutely not acceptable.  Luckily I like bacon, but even still I could not even eat the 2nd half of the sandwich because of the high salt level.  And it wasn't the bacon that made the sandwich salty...it was overly salty on its own!  It also had some chicken parts that were fatty and not edible which was gross, but I can give them a pass this time on that part.  Fries come with the sandwich and when I opened them up they were cold.  Although this was take-out, my office is right at the navy yard, not far at all from where the restaurant is so it shouldn't have been completely cold.  I could even forgive that part, but I can't forgive the fact that they were also completely covered in salt just like my chicken salad sandwich!  I couldn't escape the salt no matter what I seemed to have there!  What a shame! There is a real epidemic of over seasoning by chefs these days with salt and pepper.   If chefs would only realize that if it needs more salt or pepper, we can add it ourselves!! I mean, you can always put more on, but you can't take it off once it's on there!  Everyone has a different level of tolerance for salt/pepper so they need to take that into consideration when cooking for people!  Just because the chef likes a lot of salt doesn't mean we all do!  Or maybe chefs are just not tasting the food before they send it out, not sure.  But basically they are ruining their potentially great dishes by over seasoning!  Another thing which was weird was that they gave me a container of mayo.  Why would I need to add more mayo to the chicken salad which already has mayo???!!! Strange I thought, but perhaps a simple mistake and not that big of a deal.   Overall, I feel like menu is overly laden with fatty foods and heavy dishes with over salted items and unfortunately, there is little to eat at all that appears healthy, other than a salad which other yelpers commented was drenched in salad dressing, making it again unhealthy.  So that is disappointing for sure. They have the makings for a great restaurant here but definitely need some serious tweeks.  On a positive note, I am happy with the location as it is close to work and I really do like the décor.  The staff was also extremely pleasant and helpful.  I will definitely give this place another shot as it is close to where I work, but if they strike out again, I'm not sure I'll return for food, close or not.  I may give the happy hour a try if just for a cocktail anyway.  I really hope you guys are reading these comments and taking these things as constructive criticism.  I'm sorry this review comes off so negative, but guys please make some changes to both the menu choices and the food prep/seasoning.  I really want to like this place!  And you may want to take a trip over to Moonshine on Moyamensing, 'cause those guys are doing it right!  The food and even the drinks are phenomenal there!  The menu is similar actually, but they are just executing it way way better.  Sorry guys, just being honest.

"The inconsistency of this establishment is AMAZING! Third review I've written, and very different from the previous two. I wanna love this place so much, and I do think the food is great! Except for the fact that they're always missing the details. Over 3 times they've forgot a drink or chips of mine with a delivery order and for the second time they've forgotten an item on their sandwich. I asked them which sandwiches had pineapple on them and they said the Thai Stick did, so I ordered that. I got my sandwich to go and when I unwrapped it at home, guess what? Yeah, no pineapples. They also forgot the bell peppers and the cheese. I'm sorry, but with how inconsistent they are, I would rather go to Jimmy Johns where it's a 1/4 of the wait, and always exactly what I ordered.  Edit: I found the pineapple! One piece buried in the bread.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Ordered two teas. They took forever to get there and we're overstepped, and thus bitter.  Ordered two breakfasts. Very long wait to get there.

"Last time, I got the garlic chicken. It was chewy and slimy, and didn't really taste like garlic. This time, I got the yellow curry. Not terrible tasting, but the chunks of onion and carrot are gigantic, and there is barely any meat in it. The meat that is there is rubbery and unrecognizable as chicken. Crab rangoon is just cream cheese, no discernible crab or even sweetness to it. Egg roll is decent, but chewy.

"I've only eaten at Mo'Ziki one time and to be quite honest, I was not at all impressed with the food. I'm not sure what they mean by ""Greek Inspired Flavors"" other than it's... well, not Greek. As a lover of Greek-American cooking, I've acquired a taste for good quality Gyros such as the ones found at Athenian Garden in St. Pete and Greek Islands Restaurant in Clearwater. The gyro I ate at Mo'Ziki certainly wouldn't qualify as ""bad"" so much as it was simply nondescript. There was no evidence of individual flavors within the pita wrap. It tasted completely homogeneous, as if all the ingredients were blended together. This was startling to me considering the intense ingredients involved. The meat itself simply didn't taste like much of anything. If I had to guess, I would say that there was no lamb whatsoever in it. The tsaziki was fine, if unremarkable. It seemed to lack the essence of cucumber that generally permeates the sauce. Even the kalamata olives had no zing to them, nor did the feta cheese. Normally, a gyro containing such flavorful ingredients gives each one of them a moment to shine throughout the dining experience. Each flavor should rear its head periodically and make itself known. Every bite of the Mo'Ziki gyro tasted the same. Everything appeared to be fresh so I honestly don't know what to attribute all of this too. Perhaps, the flavors were toned down for ""less ethnic"" tastes. This might be the case since Mo'Ziki seems set up more for the lunch-time, working crowd who are generally in a rush for quick simple eats. I suppose as simple lunch fare goes, Mo'Ziki is far better than most fast food and not unlike Subway in a variety of ways. Cost-wise, I thought it was steep for what I got. The wrap with a bottle of water came to about $8. $1 - $2 more at an authentic Greek eatery would get me a sizable salad and fries along with a far superior gyro. The service was quick enough. The toppings are dispensed the same way as at a Subway sandwich shop. The atmosphere inside is very open and bright with a nice blue, green color scheme that matches their website. The restaurant seemed clean and a generally nice environment for lunch. Those familiar with authentic Greek-American gyros likely won't care for Mo'Ziki. Those who aren't familiar with Mediterranean food would be behooved to initiate their palate elsewhere. As a quick alternative to the usual fast-food out there? Absolutely... but that's about it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The portions have diminished significantly. Whereas before I might not have finished a burrito or gogi bowl, I now leave still feeling hungry and wondering if my money could have been better spent elsewhere. In fact, I'm certain of it. As difficult as it may be, because the quality of the food is still quite high, I will not be patronizing Seoul taco again. It is utterly disingenuous to charge the same prices for dishes that contain at best 60% of the food they used to. I would rather pay more and get a satisfying meal, than sit at a table looking at a burrito that is more tortilla than pretty much anything else. I'm deeply saddened by the direction the restaurant has gone in. Maybe the costs incurred as a result of the recent move have caused this. I don't know.  All I hope for is that the management sees the error of their ways and brings back the previous portions (at a higher cost if need be).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
This used to be hands down the best Chinese restaurant in New Orleans. I took and told everyone I met about it. When they first opened it was the best you could get for sure. Unfortunately recently they seem to have changed the chicken they use in recipes like general tso. It used to to be the freshest white meat chicken that was nearly perfect. Recently they seem to have switched to standard frozen chicken pieces that can be had at any mall or subpar Chinese restaurant. They still do have good items that we enjoy and that seem to be fresh. The Cho Cho's are phenomenal and now all I order as a meal. I would recommend for anything other than a chicken dish apparently. And if they ever go back to using fresh not frozen chicken like when they first opened I'll post a review of 5 stars like I would have before the change.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Our server, on the other hand, was nothing more than a bad tempered bully.  As he approached our table he corrected us for not waiting to be seated, and pointed 20' across the patio at a sign... which was the opposite direction from where we had entered. As if that wasn't enough, he then told us we shouldn't have moved the tables together because they're delicate... good grief!

"I have a weird relationship with this place. I WANT to like it REALLY BAD. I want to love it.  Sometimes I come in and it's great, but expensive. Other times I walk out and notice I feel a little bit off color and I don't know why. I couldn't figure it out, but I wouldn't be hungry at all for a long while afterward.  Recently, I figured out why I felt bad, I am nauseous from the food! What started as a minor nausea has become worse, whatever they are doing wrong is getting worse! I don't know what it is, or why, but I have pointed it out to the blonde woman who works there.   They have great deals on some nights, but I just feel ill from this food and it bugs me because I love Mexican food! This place is so convenient, and I can't go to it. It's like something in the soda or the meat, but I can't be sure. A few years ago it didn't have this problem.   Bottom line is that I am concerned that they are leaving food out or not taking proper precautions with things. I suspect it is affecting the quality of the food.

"Sighs! I am going to have to go against the grain on this one. I finally made it to Rush Hour and I was very much disappointed. Rush Hour is housed off 34th St in South side St. Pete. You have to pay attention because it can be missed very easily. I arrived during lunch time and not many patrons inside. I love me some soul food and usually stick with collards and mac n cheese for my sides. I chose Trevon's fried chicken, mac and cheese and fried corn. They didn't have collards available. I had to wait 20 minutes for my chicken as they prepare it to order. While waiting I sipped on some sweet tea. The sweet tea wasn't homemade and it didn't impress me. I retrieved my food and began to dig in. My fried chicken was golden and crispy. It was very flavorful. I thoroughly enjoyed this bird. However, my mac n cheese.......thumbs down! I don't know how they prepare it but I couldn't take more than 2 bites. No thank you! But the fried corn was pretty tasty. I would visit again just for wings IF I am in the area.

"Wow. It appears that I'm the only one that has had multiple 'meh' expeirences here. I came here once, when it first opened- and almost threw up into my plate. No joke. But I digress...  After sitting myself, I had to hunt down a waitress- who did not speak english- and I had to keep repeating 'water please' until she understood me. I actually had to gesture with my hands that I wanted a drink. She returned with a glass of tepid water that was only half full, with literally 3 little peices of ice and no straw. UGH.  I ordered a Crystal Shrimp long roll (no avocado) with cream cheese. It's my 'test' order, if you will. Yea, they failed in my opinion. Big time.   The rice was notably dry and unimpressive. The breading on the shrimp was not good. It tasted like it had been either overcooked or fried in old oil. Bleh. I'd eaten only a couple pieces of the roll when I looked at the roll and noticed that the shrimp wasn't deveined! EW! In every piece of the roll you could see little black lines of shrimp shit. I almost hurled in my plate.   I waved the waitress over, but of course she couldn't understand a word I was saying. I tried explaining it to the sushi chef behind the counter but again,  no clue what I was saying. Needless to say, I paid & left. I would have refused to pay for my shit filled shrimp roll, but they had no clue what I was trying to tell them.   I swore to myself I'd never go back. Buuuut, it's near my house and I wanted to be SURE that they sucked before I ruled them out - they are so much closer than Ijji. I went back, and yea...still not impressed.   I very specifically asked the waitress to make sure the shrimp was deveined. She seemed to understand what I was asking so that was a plus. The woman who took my order, was also the woman that made my food. I hope she washed her hands. She informed me that she cut the veins out of my shrimp. However, the shrimp was not merely overcooked- it was burnt. It had that lovely scorched taste to it and even though I asked for NO sesame seeds- there they were, in all their glory. IN ABUNDANCE.    Like last time, I didn't eat more than a few pieces of the roll. It wasn't good. Too much rice and burnt shrimp-bleh. I also didn't appreciate all the sesame seeds that were in my teeth!   One positive that I will say, is that even though my food was not good, the ladies were nice (even though most of them had no clue what I was saying) they were still smiling that I-have-no-idea-wtf-you-just-said smile.

"Don't bother coming here. Xolo is completely unexceptional in every way. We like Mexican food, so we were curious to try Xolo since it took over the space where Fuji Mountain used to be. And we shouldn't have bothered.   I ordered a steak fajita that had absolutely no seasoning or flavor. It was overladen with peppers, and the corn tortillas that came with it looked and tasted like the store-bought ones I buy at Acme. I make a better fajita at home.  The guacamole at $9.50 is overpriced. You get about a large ice cream scoop's size and they don't prepare it tableside. And it isn't any better than other guacamoles out there. I'd say it's worth about $5, $7 at most, and that's being generous.  Our waiter was not very good, and bordering unctuous.   Now I understand why Besito in Ardmore is always booked.

"I really, really want to love this place. It is in an ideal location on Metairie Rd., mere moments from my house, and has that cool bistro look to it. The problem is, however, that it is not very good and the service is sub-par.   This is now the third time that I have been there, very much hoping that third time is the charm... well, it was not. Perhaps it's due to the fact that I get the EXACT SAME waitress every time... and every time, she is a complete doofus. It took her 30 minutes to get us our drinks, and my father's beer took 3 attempts to get right.   We had as an appetizer, the bucket of shrimp, which contains some BBQ'd shrimp and dipping bread. It was pretty good, but the sauce could have been a little thicker and less salty.   The meals came out sporadically... no coordination... and the taste of the food was underwhelming. The crawfish pot pie looked and smelled delicious, but had a bland, unexciting taste. The hanger steak was undercooked (as were the accompanying brussel sprouts) and the garlic fries that came with it were not very tasty. My sister ordered grilled shrimp with her wedge salad, and instead received grilled chicken  The best part of the meal, for me, was the bread pudding. I thought it was very good, it had a crispy sugar coated top layer, was baked nicely, and had a yummy scoop of praline ice cream atop. My wife didn't feel the same way... she thought the pudding was too ""eggy.""  The main problem was the service... it always TAKES FOREVER to eat here and we always get stuck with the same goof nut waitress that doesn't know her head from her behind. We had to point out to her that the bill was wrong... it was missing some of the items we ordered and off by about $50. Being honest people, we made sure to tell the waitress and had her adjust the bill to properly reflect the food that we ordered.

"The delivery was free and fast and we got very large portions for a small amount of money and that is where the good comes to a complete halting stop.  When I called to order, the teenager who answered the phone sounded like he was incredibly stoned and perturbed to leave his Marley music to take a petty ""to-go"" order via phone. He was also very hard to understand and was increasingly irritated when I asked him ""huh??"" multiple times. I understand there is a language barrier but I was very patient, and he could have been as well.  Secondly, the food kind of sucked. I'm pretty sure that my spring egg rolls had cheese in the middle. Cheese. In a spring roll. Cheese!! Not to mention that it was partly frozen which meant that these were not freshly made, and you could definitely tell by the poor taste.   The pepper steak tasted more like barbecued pork than it did steak and was so few in number that I should have just ordered onions and peppers, because that is exactly what I received and this is after I specifically asked for a ""large"" portion.   The pork lo mein was the only decent part of the entire meal because the lo mein noodles were fantastic. They were soft and marinated in a nice soy sauce and came with plenty of pork.

"This place gets 3 stars for good bottomless mimosas. We did brunch on a Sunday,  a group of us girls wanted to get together at last min and this place had an opening. And bottomless mimosas.  While the food wasnt bad, its was fairly underwhelming. There are a ton of great brunch places in New Orleans.... Dijon offered ok food, for about $5-$10 more than other places would charge for good food. Two of us got the cornbread french toast and  2 others got the grits and grillades. The cornbread french toast was $14 for 2 pieces of corn bread, some Steens syrup, and 2 peices of bacon. I mean the cornbread was good, sweet and moist... but it was not french- toasty at all.... I dunno, I guess i kinda expected it to be pan fried like french toast? Instead it was just 2 squares of cornbread with syrup. The grits and grillades arent like others that I have had (Im from south Louisiana so I grew up with them). The meat was really chewy too. However, the grits themselves were really good.   We were 1 of 2 tables in the entire restaurant at prime brunch time...so, if you need to organize something in a pinch, brunch is wide open here!

My wife had the stuffed crab, which was ok, nothing to write home about, tasted like the ones you get in the grocery store, her veggies were cold.  I had the stuffed flounder, the flounder was actually very good but the stuffing reminded me of my mom's snotty thanksgiving stuffing, inedible really unless you like that sort of thing and it didn't taste like crab at all, I asked for mash potatoes and got french fries...no biggie...if I lived in the area I might give them another shot to redeem themselves but I found much better places while in the big easy....",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I love asian food, it is one of my favorites.....if not my all time fav food but this place was so disappointing:(  It is close to my home, so I wanted it to be so good.  First off they had no Sweet and Sour Chicken which is what my husband wanted, I ordered a vermicelli bowl and he ended up getting pad thai.  Both, not great......very bland, the best thing about the meal was the free onion cakes which were actually good but how hard is an onion cake?!!!   The spring rolls were not very good, they even tasted undercooked to me.  Their won-ton soup was probably the worst I have ever had, I didn't even eat it....  Overall if you like it here, you either have never had good asian food or just have no tastebuds.  The service was alright and we did get 10% off most likely due to the fact they had no chicken.  This is why the 2 stars!  Try Quan's for a good vermicelli bowl :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I thought I wrote a review before, but I haven't. I would've given it 4 stars the many times before. However, it's gone down in service and the price has increased. It was $17-18 for a sandwich and grapes for lunch. It's an extra $2 for sides. Crazy! The fish wasn't that big either. The kids meal was 3 grouper nuggets and grapes. We had a grumpy waitress who became grumpier when we questioned the cost. Bummer. Won't be returning. We used to take family and friends here for grouper sandwiches.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Eh, meh, whatever...  Lauren was a very capable bartender, knowledgeable, friendly, pleasant.  The downstairs bar was cold, as in lack of a comfortable ambiance.   I felt like I was sitting in the back kitchen instead of a welcoming bar.    The beers were above average at best.  I had tasted three different ones, none stood out more than any other craft beer I've ever had.  The fish tacos were average, although half price on Tuesday night made them a tad more delicious.  The french fries were under cooked, almost cold, almost raw.  And I had to bury them in ketchup, requested three times, to make them edible and flavorful.  The pork sandwich (The Boneshaker, oh paleeeese) had decent flavors with the rosemary and provolone,  but the pork itself was a little dry.  And the long ""hots"" weren't hot at all.  The Brussels sprouts, 4 stars, were the best things I put in my mouth (to that point of the evening).   I may or may not return, the jury is out.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I had my best friend over from Germany to visit and thought we give this place a try to celebrate his visit.  Let me start with the positive points about our experience.  The steak I ate was not bad. I would not say it was spectacular - but it was good.  However, with a $$$$ menu I have certain expectations when it comes to service and location.  The interior of the restaurant was more along the line of a high scale diner. Most noticeable were broken lights and broken light fixtures. The floor was very dirty and the tables next to use were not cleaned up either. Our table was along a half-wall that runs in a semi-circle around the bar. The top of that wall was covered in dust. If you can't keep areas clean that are available to your guests, I can only imagine how private areas such as the kitchen look like.  Service was pretty much on par with what you would expect from your average diner. It certainly did not match the $$$$ menu expectations.   Overall this restaurant was not even close to what I was expecting based on me reading reviews and reviewing their menu and website.  If you want to eat a expensive steak in a diner setting - this would be the place for you. For me it was most likely a once in a life time experience. I don't think I will go back there.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The wings, although lukewarm, were good which garnered the 2 stars, but the pizza was not to my liking. I'm not into sweet sauce so this pizza was not doing it for me. I'm also not into putting delivered pizzas in the oven and heating them myself. I even tried to call the store at 10:20, but they put on the ""closed"" message, which was 10 minutes early.

I know I have to pay $2 or $3 for a Coke these days. This is made infinitely more painful when it is not refilled. The only thing a server can do that is almost as annoying as not refilling drinks is making me wait for the check, especially at lunch. We waited and waited and waited with our dirty plates and empty glasses.  I know that generally breakfast is a racket and it's not like I haven't paid $20 for lunch before.

I've only eaten in the bar and the cocktail waitresses SUCK.  You have to flag someone down to even order a drink, then everything from there takes forever.  I've had the same girl several times who is unfriendly.  I guess if you look like an attractive man or a rich (high-tipping) business man, you should be ok.  Bad wings - great bruchetta!

"This is a higher-priced semi-fast food place.  They recently opened so they have a few kinks to work out.  A basket ""value"" meal for two can run $20 and over; not very budget friendly. They have lots of menu items so there may be plenty of choices if you have picky eaters.  Sundaes seem like every other sundae you can get anywhere but toppings are $1 extra; a little expensive for a teaspoonful of nuts if you ask me.  Burger meat I could easily compare to Wendy's.  On a good day, the buns are okay.  On a bad day, they may have too much butter and salt and can get soggy fairly quick. They did mess up my order at one point, but the manager gave me a coupon for use at a later date. I redeemed it today and I can see why my order was messed up.  Instead of keying in my order exactly like I placed it and just taking off the things I didn't want or ringing it as plain, the cashier decided to ring my order a different way.  I appreciate that she was trying to save me a few cents but she ignored the fact that I said I had a coupon and repeated an incorrect item twice.  I could tell she got a slight attitude with me but since my order was wrong once, I needed to be sure it was right this time instead of me driving off and coming back. Overall the service is okay and it wasn't too long of a wait.  Like I said, they recently opened this location so it's a work in progress.  The food is okay but since it's on the pricier side, it won't be an every week stop after sports and school.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"1. WHERE IS KAT?!?!? 2. My group and I have been going for about a little over a month now to every lobster night. We'd order additional food and have drinks and shoot the shit with Kat. I would reserve for the group via Facebook cuz I was never really successful at getting anyone on the phone. This past Monday was the first time Kat was not there.  Now last week after coming off a week (Mon to Sun) of a week long birthday celebration, we didn't have a typical Monday of drinks and additional food. We ordered sodas and juices because we just needed a break from alcohol. One person in our party did purchase margaritas. Sooo Ryan refilled one person in my party coca cola. I asked that he refill my Cran/Pineapple juice. He states, ""I'm going to start having to do a 1 drink minimum on Lobster Night because the lobsters are killing us."" He isnt usually there on a Monday to know what we actually spend on food AND drinks. I didnt make a big deal about it. My party and I almost cancelled the ordered (7 lobsters) and went to Turtle Bay for steaks because of the statement. We stayed because we like T (the cook). She is such a sweetheart. We are served our lobsters ($12, not double tail. Didn't know double tailed lobster was an option.) and they were just off from other Monday nights we've been. They were cold and weren't as juicy. One person opted to have her lobster reheated while others just ate them because we spent a great deal of time waiting on everyone else to arrive. While eating a customer was leaving and states, ""I'm not coming back here since Kat is gone. This guy is an asshole!"" I sympathized with her because the experience was totally different.  3. What happened to the $5 specials? Why was it discontinued? 4. Ryan will be the reason you lose repeat customers. He lacks personality and comments like ""1 drink minimum"" wasn't the time or place because people arent buying enough drinks. Well isn't it Lobster Night? 5. Bring KAT back to Monday's.

I have had two really horrible issues with service, the most recent being last night. I ordered beef and bacon sliders. And when I took the first bite, it was so red I couldn't eat it. After finally flagging down our server ten minutes later, she rudely asked if I wanted another order. I said yes please. Then I waited another 30-40 minutes (with an empty water glass). My friend finally got her attention and she said that they were out of the sliders I had ordered and the manager said I could have anything on the menu no cost to me. Where was the manager? And why had I not been told this sooner? She asked if I would like to see a menu and brought one finally five minutes later. I placed my order and finally an hour and a half from when I first ordered was given something somewhat edible. Not to mention that my boyfriend's food made him sick (he had chicken quesadillas) The server was given too many tables and was unable to be attentive and it makes me not want to go back.

When I discovered this earthy crunchy sounding menu I was pretty excited.  However, the service was pretty bad.  I ordered the Rose Benedict, which came sunnyside up.  I asked to have the eggs cooked over easy instead, and was told that was not possible, that I could have them either ""how they came or scrambled.""  I got scrambled because I do not like raw egg.  The girl behind the register had her hair down, which was unclean not to mention a health code violation.  The place was also rampant with flies.  While we were ordering two more customers came in and the girl said ""oh great, more people..""  She was clearly unhappy to be working that day.  I have worked in food service since high school, including 2 cafe's, and have never had such an attitude in front of customers.  I also find it hard to believe that they couldn't just flip the sunnyside egg over one time to make it over-easy...pretty lazy.  I was actually upset that my bf even tipped them.

I guess once we got the food it was fine. But the middle table in a partially filled restaurant...the ""we ran out of that""....the fact that I ordered a white wine and ended up with steak frites....it adds up to something far from what I expect at a place like this.

"This is at my bottom of the chain list for these big tex-mex burritos that are popular right now.  My list as follows: 1. CHIPOTLE- they will beat everyone because they have range-free chickens and their meat seasoning is wonderful, the best guacomole on the planet and their sweet tea with lime makes my lips quiver. 2. Qdoba - it's a step down from Chipotle. Meat can be a little chewy, but almost the same menu as Chipotle. 3. Moe's- They have funny names for all of their dishes and I give them credit for that, but their taco meat is just as bland as taco bell. 4.

I was really looking forward to having a good experience as I live nearby and wanted something within walking distance for the winter.  I am disappointed to say that my first experience was not good. I ordered the chicken wrapped prosciutto. It's a pricey item but I'm happy to pay for good food. What I was served was a thin schnitzel style chicken. I'm not sure where the prosciutto was.  The wine selection was limited so I thought I'd have a rye. There were many bourbons but only 2 true ryes.  The interior hard surfaces make for a loud atmosphere.  In my view the atmosphere of old brick was lost by the choice to paint it white.  There is lots parking.  I won't go back for an evening experience but I may give the breakfast a try and see if that's better.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I was really excited to try this place, but it was a big disappointment. The meats are boiled and stored in water. They actually charge you .75 to add cheese! The menu is very uninformative , it doesn't explain what comes with your burrito, it doesn't even list a kids option. I didn't even know they had fish tacos until I had ordered and sat down. The burrito was very bland and boring, It tasted like water with salsa. I will give the salsa a thumbs up! The seating is very limited and if its slow, be prepared to be awkwardly stared at by the people behind the counter. I'll stick to Moe's and California tacos.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"received a $20 comp from terribles rail city casino for this place so I thought I would try it out. I order the NY steak, crab cakes. The steak was nothing to write home about. In fact, Rail City's Ale House restaurant Has a better Steak Than this place. I asked for my steak to be cooked chared rare. It did not even come close. Had to ask for a salad. I guess that is not included with your dinner order. Crab cakes were greasy and kind of mushy and not crispy like I am used to. veggies that came with the dish had too many red bell peppers and were sparse. Also came with a piece of some kind of bread. Service was good but I would not eat here again If I had to pay the whole check. Whole meal cost 32.00. minus the $20. comp = 12.00 tip=$5.00",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This building is a former Pizza Hut, this gives you an idea of the space within. It's really not a bad place to eat to be sure. It's just that the food didn't excite me all that much. We went for breakfast, we both got omelettes. I try to go out so that I can get things that are better than what I can cook at home. This was really not the case here for the omelettes. There was absolutely nothing wrong with them though. The food was hot and tasted good. Well most of it - the hash browns were just not good. No flavor and very mushy. It was a little noisy, but that's not the diners fault. I'd say this place is fine in a pinch, but I certainly wouldn't bring my out of town guests here nor would I go out of my way to eat here. The food is also overpriced. It's far too much money for breakfast and it seems like they are trying to squeeze every last bit of profit from the experience. I think they can lower the prices a little bit. The parking lot is always packed, so either this is the new norm or the patrons haven't eaten there yet.

"EXTREMELY disappointed. I was excited to try this place because of all the good reviews I've read and the interior/atmosphere is cute and cozy.   Got in around 4pm, which is generally a really slow period since it's before everyone comes out of work, and after the lunch rush. Seated quickly, but after we got water, it took the waiter 15 minutes to get back to take our order. There was only one other table besides us so this was a bit ridiculous to not check in on us sooner as they weren't busy.   Put in an order for a burger, and it takes another 20 mins to come out. I had also asked for no cheese, and they accidentally put cheese on the burger, so they took it back and I waited another 20 mins... I'm waiting over 40 mins for a small burger, which came out extremely dry and small. I'm okay with waiting, but let me know what's going on or why it's taking so long. Nobody came over to apologize for the wait or let us know what was going on.  The waiter also forgot to ask how I'd like the patty cooked, so he automatically assumed I wanted it well done. Although I did forget to ask for medium rare, I've never had an experience where the server didn't ask first. The burger was dry and mediocre at best. There is no reason to wait 40+ mins for a small burger when the place was near empty.   Servers are extremely nice, but need to step up their game... I want to give it another try, but this was just super disappointing that I don't see a point.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Poor service today at Chipotle.  Going to Chipotle is like going to Disneyland for adults.   The staff at chipotle today was either all hung over or all just pissed off.  They just slopped the ingredients and gave so little.  When I asked for some more rice she gave 1/4 more if a spoonful.  They were low on ingredients so instead of filling my bowl to the correct portion and getting more they just gave a tiny amount.    I left very annoyed after this experience.

Ok so I was trying this place for the first time. I wanted to enjoy some mexican food. Sadly I did not. The chips and salsa were super bland. I decided to get calamari steak dinner as I love calamari but have never had a calamari steak. It was very tasteless except for the huge amount of cilantro which made it taste kind of leafy. The veggies were a bit under done and the rice also bland.

Their chargrilled were the worst I've eaten, they may have invented them but they forgot how to make them. Three of our dozen had no sauce or anything. Two were burned. Terrible for their signature, the voisan were good but a bit overpowered by the sauce but definitely the highlight of the meal, their red beans should be poured out. They were red bean soup with not a bean in sight. The grillades and grits, the grits were in lumps that had a crust from being set out for a long time, the grillades were fatty and not appealing. They tasted good. Bit I threw 1/2 away because of the amount of fat. The service was terrible, a saints player was next to us in her section and she was too concerned with his party to fill our tea or give us timely service. I won't be back.

It tasted good, but there was so little of it. We ordered 5 entrees and a couple sizes to share. The best 2 things we ate were the buffalo shrimp steamed buns and the wasabi mashed potatoes. Everything else was just OK and the pad Thai was downright disappointing (it tasted like it was smothered in ketchup!). $500 later we left, having enjoyed only 2 drinks each, mostly beer and underwhelmed with the experience.

"I hadn't ever been to Cracker Barrel until quite recently, and I've never really been interested in visiting, for it wasn't exactly my kind of restaurant. But for Mother's Day, my mother picked this restaurant to go to for breakfast.  So we went. And let me say I wasn't surprised by how I didn't really care for it. It was average, to say at best, just not for me.  The gift shop was the best part for me, for you could look around for a while until you were called to your table (which took quite a long time), but no problem.  We got our food, I got a salad, because it was around bunch time, and I've never been a big fan of breakfast.  So everyone's meal was being delivered at our table except my salad. Now I assumed that the waitress ran out of free hands and would come back with it. Nope. It didn't come out for quite a long time. I stayed there waiting while everyone else dined and I couldn't quite think of what happened to cause this delay. Finally, my salad arrived with the ""oh sorry we're a bit busy today""  I decided it was best just to take the salad and try to put the minor setback behind me. The food was average, and the wait staff was overall, pretty friendly. Not a fan of the rustic atmosphere but that is my own personal taste.  After heading back into the gift shop, my company wanted to buy some things. We were unsuccessful with any of our purchases. So my friend bought a miniature terrarium which came with seeds, dirt, and the terrarium. Simple enough. When we got home and opened it, only the terrarium and dirt was there. So being close by, we drove back and explained the mistake and they understood and grabbed us another one, which we opened, and that also didn't have any seeds.  I don't know what happened there but it certainly wasn't right how they set the resealed boxes back on the shelf to be purchased.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I grew up in Boston and lived in NYC for some time and I have definitely tried more than 100 different pizza joints over the years - I consider myself to be a pizza lover.  So I just moved to Reno and set myself the mission of finding the best pizza in the city - because I have to have my pizza fix at least once a week.  I actually drove past Nu Yalk a couple of times and finally stopped in one day with my wife.    Now, I understand the whole New York attitude thing, and I did live there for  years, but I'm sorry - being rude is not a NY attitude.  It's just poor service.  I am a respectful friendly person and I don't like being mistreated - maybe I'm oversensitive but I HATE rude service.  These guys acted like they were doing me a favor.  It was my first time there and I found the menu board confusing, and was pressured to order.  They weren't busy so I took my time and finally ordered from the unsmiling guy who makes the pizza.  He handed me a piece of paper and didn't say a word.  I moved over to the cashier guy (there was a young girl standing there who watched me without saying a word) who rang me up while staring me down.  Ummmm .....no tip for you tough guy.   I waited for our slices and figured the pizza guy was yelling at me when my slices came up - and then we ate.    Well, the pizza is good.  Overpriced without a doubt but at least it wasn't crap.  A cheese slice after tax is $2.32. - add a topping and its almost $3.  A 15 inch pie with 3 toppings is close to $25.  Living in NYC I could get slices like this on every corner (usually cheaper too), so it was nothing amazing, but not bad for this area.  The sauce is tasty - the crust was thin and the toppings good.    So my final verdict - I might go there once in a while to get  a pizza to go.  The jerk at the cash register will never get a tip from me, and although I might enjoy eating their pizza once in a while, I will never enjoy overpaying for it, while being glared at by the staff.    Honestly, I will keep looking for better service and value, hopefully without sacrificing taste and pizza quality.    I think I better start making my own pizza because 80% of the places I try do not measure up to my standards!  Yeah I expect a lot - but when I ran a restaurant, I set the bar for service and food quality, and expected all my employees to measure up.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
I had such high hopes for this place but it was kinda a let down. Cute atmosphere and decor. The hostess was friendly and seated us quickly even though we were a bit early.   Our waitress on the other hand was the complete opposite. She seemed to be in a mood. Like would rather of been anywhere else. What irritated me was that she never came to check on us. Just took our order brought the food. Cleared the plates and dropped the check. Barely spoke.   When we asked about drink recommendations and clarification the information and descriptions she provided were far from accurate. I was going to order the scroppino but when I asked her about it she told me it's really more of a dessert than a drink. Very sweet and mostly sorbet. Not true. I ended up holding off on ordering one until after my meal and it was not sweet at all. Yes it has sorbet in it but the ratio of alcohol to sorbet is definitely heavier on the alcohol side. It was very strong! You don't even need a spoon or anything to eat it. The small scoop of sorbet in the middle melts pretty quick. Also the menu said blackberry sorbet. The sorbet in my drink was definitely not blackberry. Thank god I don't have any food allergies but it would have been nice if she told me it was being substituted. I think it had some kind of citrus sorbet instead. I never got a chance to ask because she just dropped the food and walked off and I really didn't want to make a big deal about it.   For the rest of our food we started with the meatballs. Average. Nothing to rave about. Very heavy on the cheese. Could have used a little more sauce.   For entrees I got the lobster fra diavolo. I was quite disappointed by this. The only lobster in the dish is the half tail they garnish it with on top. They don't even give you a full lobster tail and it's a pretty pricey dish. The rest is just a plate of pasta with pretty bland sauce. Nothing out the ordinary. Tasted like it could have been from a jar.   My friend ordered the rigatoni alla vodka. Definitely the better of the 2 dishes ordered but still nothing to really rave about.   For dessert we also ordered a tiramisu. This was the only thing that either of us really liked. It was super cute. Nice presentation and tasted amazing. Very moist and flavorful.   I really wanted to like this place but ultimately it was a letdown.

"This place is going downhill, unfortunately. The only reason I go there is to have a ""The Chief"" bagel sandwich (smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers, onions , and sliced tomatoes). The employees were so lost and confused that I almost felt sorry for them... I waited several minutes before they took my order. When they finally did they didn't take my payment, which was weird because you order at the counter. Meanwhile, the line of people was piling up behind me. Next person in line from what I observed went through the same delays I did. After ordering there was another long wait to get my simple sandwich. When I got it, I had to flash my payment card in front of them otherwise I'd have eaten for free LOL Now the food. I was very disappointed with the size of the whole wheat bagel. It's about half of what you can get at other bagel shops or even at the grocery store. When I was half way through I noticed that something was wrong. It still tasted alright, but there was something missing. Sure enough, no tomato slices! I debated if I should complain but ended up not saying anything because it'd take forever to fix it.

I was looking forward to a Dominos pizza.  After paying $9.99 for a small carryout I noticed the window sign that said they had a special for a large carryout for $7.00.  I guess that was my bad.

"I've eaten here three times. The first first two times I loved this place, best margaritas, delicious chicken empanada, beautiful patio. It would of been an five stars.   But... tonight was different story. I haven't eaten here since last spring/summer so it has really gone downhill. Everything was bad that could be bad at restaurant. Chips were stale and got caught in teeth, white cheese dip was white paste, salsa had consistency of ketchup. I ordered the Navajo Taco didn't finish just tasted like lemon juice, husband's shrimp quesadillas entree was three tiny triangles t. My brother in law got the California wrap and said was ""interesting"" which is not a good thing. We all ordered fruit margaritas and they salted rim instead of sugared.

"It was my first time visiting this new location. I used to love this place when it was over on Speedway. Even though the service was always pretty slow the food was consistently great. I brought my friend who has never been before and we were immediately greeted and told how it works. We sat at the bar and ordered some boca balls. My friend is severely allergic to avocado, and they didn't have avocado listed on the menu, so we thought that menu item would be safe to start. Lo and behold the boca balls came out with a bunch of avocado spread on the bottom for presentation. Not a huge deal, but we asked the guy (Ethan) who dropped it off if it was avocado and then explained that there was an allergy. He was obviously upset and took them away. We apologized and he passive aggressively said ""yeah well next time tell your server about your allergies."" He was just being a total jerk for no reason. We sat waiting for the replacement and he said something to the couple next to us (because they ordered two drinks at once) along the lines of, ""thanks guys you're so much better at this than SOME other people"" obviously referring to us.   Now, I've worked in the industry for years. We were not impolite or upset or anything until this started. We finished our boca balls and left. Our actual server Jacob was super nice and the boca balls were great but this other guy behind the bar was literally just being a jerk for no reason. I can see how an allergy might be frustrating, but it's completely unreasonable to expect someone to list off their allergies when ordering an appetizer just in case the item has it (when it's not listed on the menu).   I typically only write reviews when I really love a place. I just couldn't believe how hostile this guy was over a small miscommunication and an easy fix. If you're ok with overlooking being berated by some random server, this place is for you. The food is great. I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Came in an hour before closing time with some friends from work. As soon as we are seated it takes several minutes for a server to greet us. When are server is taking our order the bartender grabs him to say its last call (45 minutes before closing time). So we give our drink order, and our server comes back for the food order (we ordered appetizers). We get our food well before we get our drinks. It took roughly 25 minutes from the time we walked in to get our drinks. Someone needs to fire that bartender with the spiky blonde hair.

"I ate here years ago and liked it, but today 1/17/11 I must say it was bad. Take the beach atmosphere away and you'd find the food awful. I think the nice atmosphere somehow makes one blind to the bad food. Started with clam chowder, not bad, not great either. My main order, fried clam strips with cole slaw. About 1/2-3/4 through the meal I closed my eyes to blind me from the beach atmosphere and yuk, the clam strips were stall, luke warm, and rubbery; I really should have sent the food back after the first bite. The slaw was vinegar style (not creamy) and pretty tasteless, I added lemon juice and pepper to get some flavor. The best part of the meal was the chowder, coffee, and ice water.

No joke, it took 50 minutes to get a 3 topping pizza in a restaurant that was moderately busy at best. We sat there so long that we actually got full eating our appetizer salad and decided to get the pizza to go.

"On one of those winter Saturday nights in Tucson during the gem show when every great restaurant has an hour-long wait, we opted for Molina's Midway. As I predicted, we would be seated right away. On a night like this, that fact was ominous in itself. We settled into our little booth in the kitsch linoleumed dining room. The service was friendly and prompt. Our cold chips were served with a modified ketchup bottle full of salsa, and when we asked for a milder version the server quickly provided a ramekin with fresh chopped tomatoes which had diluted the heat. Not a fleck of cilantro floated there. Two of us chose the carne seca burrito, which at $9.75 is a couple bucks cheaper than the ""burro."" Still, when it arrived small and lonely on a vast white plate with a small pile of iceberg lettuce alongside, I was disappointed. The burrito bore the telltale signs of microwave torture: hot lava interior and opaque, soggy tortilla. No veggies, no cheese, nothing but the bubbling magma of what had once purportedly been carne seca. Also, our quesadilla could have been used as a James Bond-style lead frisbee the next day. Avoid the Midway.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"pastor tacos were extremely dry and overcooked, and the Tortillas they were served on were cold. Not just sitting out too long cold. Like the Tortillas were literally cold to the touch like they hadn't been warmed up. I took a tray of 4 tacos back to be remade because of this and all they did was throw the tacos back on the flat top to be heated up . You would think after paying $63 for a bunch of tacos they would at least come hot. So they corrected the cold Tortilla part, but not the crazy dry crunchy pastor meat in my tcaos. And the worst part is, the girl who took the food back and ""had it remade"" had a nasty attitude about the whole situation. Definitely won't be returning here.  Complete order was 5 pastor tacos 1/5 (dry, and needed salt)  1 fish Taco 4/5 (my favorite)  1 octopus Taco 4/5 (pricey)  1 chicken mole 1/5 (way too sweet)  2 birria tacos 3/5 (meat had good flavor)   I feel like these tacos Def need to come with onion and cilantro.

Heard all about the great chicken but after stepping one foot  in this oven, anything too hot was out of the question. I opted for the oyster poboy.

"After reading so many positive reviews, I was excited to try this place.  It was pretty busy when my group arrived for dinner but we were seated right away on the family side.  We requested this side as the bar side had music so loud it was difficult to have a conversation.  We ordered buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer.  It was definitely the highlight of the evening.  It is a large portion size with great tortilla chips.  The rest of the meal was disappointing after that.  Two of us had wings, both boneless and bone-in.  Both kinds of wings were dry and very small.   The boneless wings were DRY and more breading that meat by a lot.  The bone-in wings were also dry and stringy.  So stringy you had to use a fork and knife to get the meat off the bone.  One of us had fish and chips; the fish was ok but again there was too much breading which was very soggy.  The macaroni and cheese side is a very generous portion but the taste is not pleasing.  It just tastes ""off.""  The french fries were very disappointing.  They weren't crispy at all and the flavor wasn't anything special.    I doubt I ever go back based on this experience.

They have Merchandise for Purchase for those who are looking for a FM Hat, T-Shirt, Mug, or Gift Cards!   We were wanting Breakfast as our first Breakfast Spot did not work out. We arrived about 20 mins before Breakfast Promptly Stops at 10:30am to find a huge slow moving line. Even though people in front of us and in the Restaurant were still being Served Breakfast, once it was finally our turn to order they were no longer serving Breakfast and had switched to Lunch...   We have visited for Breakfast before; ordering the Veggie Omelet and Mercantile Breakfast Sandwich. Both were decent nothing outstanding but the In-Laws love it here so back again now for the Served Lunch Hour-   My Husband and I both ordered the 4th Ave Club. We tweaked our Sandwiches a bit to our liking with my request being without Cheese, Ham, & Mayo and my Husbands without Cheese & Mayo. What in turn we actually got was two completely different Sandwiches... My Sandwich came as directed Complete with Stale Multigrain Bread. My Husbands Sandwich was a FAIL- Stale Sourdough Bread with a small amount of Ham, No Turkey, and with Mayo & Cheese. The Huge Noticeable Differences in the Sandwiches makes no sense at all. They are the exact same thing with one being Extremely Skimpy and the other being jam packed. How? The rest of the Tables Sandwiches also came with the Notably Stale Bread as well.

I had the chicken curry and I honestly think the cooks were having a bad day, but: A. The food was overly salted. ""Heavy handed"" doesn't even describe the sodium levels going on in that entree.  It was like someone tripped and dropped a bottle of salt in the pots.   B.  Different food will have different flavor but somehow everything tasted alike...and salty. It should be noted that I did not complain so the restaurant did not have opportunity to correct the matter. I dined in after work and ate it because I paid for it and didn't feel like raising a stink or waiting around for another plate of food.  - Not much parking space.  If business starts to boom, how will they accomodate the traffic?  I would've come sooner, my boyfriend and I, but there was nowhere to park when we drove past.  Everyone raves about the seafood.

"When we heard that Pi Pizza was opening a Mexican restaurant in the old Rothchild's Antique location (one of the best corners in the CWE), my wife and I were excited.  Based on the high quality of the food at Pi, my wife and I was expecting excellent Mexican food, a great decor and great margaritas.  We live in the CWE and have a second home in Mexico, so we were hoping for some awesome truly Mexican food.  Unfortunately, we are disappointed.  The restaurant's name, ""Gringos"", is appropriate.  It is Mexican food to which US documented citizens are accustomed, not too different from what you would get in a shopping mall's Mexican restaurant.  In particular, the chips, salsa and guacamole were all bland.  The decor has little resemblance to anything that is Mexican.  I am sure that the modern decor and the renovation of the antique shop were expensive, but it reflects the bland nature of the food.  I ordered the Classica Margarita (about $7), and received a small glass of watered down lemon water with just a splash of tequila.  It wasn't worth the price, and wasn't very good. For the price, I expected a big bowl margarita with a typical heavy dose of tequila and a great sour margarita mix.  On the other hand, I thought that the fish tacos were comparably good (not excellent, but passable).  While good, the fish tacos did not wow me with a unique Mexican flavor (i.e., it was somewhat of a Gringo taco), I thought that they were good.  We did have the opportunity to speak to the manager, who politely acknowledged our polite criticism.  He said that the restaurant was new and would be making adjustments.

"From the looks of the other reviews, perhaps I have to give SFP another chance.   My friends brought me a burrito from here, which I was really excited to try, but when I bit into it, I got a mouthful of nothing by white rice. As I ate through the burrito, the other flavors slowly faded into existence as I approach the center, where the the majority of the unevenly distributed filling found its residence. When I got to the other end of the burrito, it faded back to rice again. I could tell that it would have been very good had it been better prepared, but for a $7 burrito, I was pretty underwhelmed. If I'm going to spend $7 on a burrito, I will go to Don Memo's food cart, who has the best burrito in West Phila.   Their menu, ranging from pho through coq au vin, does look quite creative, though.

"I have to say first and foremost I am a manager for a restaurant and have been in the industry for 10+ years so my review may be more in depth. Getting there, I loved to see this black owned business with a good vibe, and cleanliness. My girlfriend wanted to try this place out as we both like to support black owned businesses, but here were my issues:  Ordered the Coconut shrimp or an appetizer and the shrimp were raw. And though I'm not big on sending food back to the kitchen, (for health reasons) we decided to do so.   We decided to order our entrees (in which felt weird seeming I had to wave my bartender/server down to do so instead of having that constant checking from the server). I asked for the Lamb and instead of getting the whole order I got an add on order (less than half the amount I wanted). By the way, those lamb chops were delicious! My girlfriend ordered the shrimp and grits. After 45 minutes of waiting, she never got those grits. So we just decided to ask for the check and get food elsewhere. I know sometimes the kitchen can get backed up, however being the 2nd or 3rd party to get seated, I don't know how that would be the case. And knowing the average cook time on a shrimp and grits at any given establishment would be 15- no more than 20 minutes prep time.   We got the shrimp back and it was over cooked unfortunately as expected. So we just decided to cut our losses and leave.   Now the most important thing that I could stress and hopefully make this place better? Smiles and attentiveness. I don't believe we were greeted with a smile from the time we entered to the time we left. There was a lack of morale, a lack of ""believing in the business"". This place has the utmost potential, and being a previous resident of the area, I know how important it is in what thriving black businesses do to that community. However, great customer service and a well oiled kitchen staff can make you or break you.   Unfortunately, my girlfriend is ""one and done"" with the business, but I hope possibly in the future, I can witness the true potential this place has to offer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I know it's Nashville, and the hip thing to do is the hype of a place. Unfortunately the hype was not lived up to as most have in the past. A group of 8 of us ate there on a Sunday night, which was still busy at 6:30. We were seated immediately then told it'd be 30 minutes on a thin crust and 45 on a deep dish.   By the time we got the order in, and also order three appetizers for the table it had been bumped to an hour wait on the pizza. It took over 30 minutes for the appetizers which were good- arancini, pretzels and a salad. When we were closing in on the 90 minute mark was when we got all three pizzas. All three that we ordered, two deep dish and one thin, were all way overdone. The thin was burned on the bottom and hard on top. Our waitress seemed exasperated that we would dare come in on a Sunday night for food. She finally just put the pitcher of water on the table because we kept having to flag her down for refills.   While this is minor, it was also unbearably hot in the restaurant as the sun was coming in. Our entire party remarked at the heat and need for them to turn up the A/C on hotter days and when the sun's coming in through one whole side of your establishment.

The dining experience begins with the salsa -- a young lady comes to the table to mix it for you. Our lass did not smile once, despite having a BIG sign and envelope asking for tips.  First ingredient - CANNED TOMATOES!!  Oh my goodness, horrible!!  (And if they're not canned, they surely tasted like supermarket canned tomatoes!!) The chips to enjoy this salsa with also tasted like bagged supermarket chips. Next, I asked for a Mexican soft drink (after all, this is labeled as authentic Mexican).  No Jarritos, no Sidral, nothing authentic.  Second disappointment. Next up - the food.  I ordered one of their combo platters that brought carne asada, a chile relleno, and an enchilada, and requested a pork tamale on the side additionally.  The carne asada had no flavor (not even that of a grilled steak), the chile relleno did not seem fresh as if it had been fried a while ago and reheated.   Honestly, quite the disappointment.  With so much competition (Mexican restaurants are found everywhere in Tucson), you'd think this establishment would want to excel in quality.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"So this was not a bad experience. The employees were kind and respectful. I visited this buffet New Year's Day with my fiancé. Now I am not a huge fan of buffets in general. The restaurant in general is in need of updates cosmetically. The lighting needs be adjusted, as it is too low. They have a sushi bar, that has a small variety. For as the Chinese food, it was okay. There not too much variety in options. The restaurant appeared to be busy, but the food wasn't coming out hot. I heard they have a menu and I wish I would have order off of the menu. I gave the restaurant a fair rating because the buffet was price well. Also, in case you are wondering they do not have crab legs.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"So we drove from Detroit just to try this place. And I want to like it, I do...but the macaroni and cheese seemed to come right out of a box. The cornbread and hush puppies were for folks who'd never had the real thing. The ribs were good, the pulled pork was tender, dry and had no real smokey flavor.

"Went here on a Saturday night and ordered a bunch of small plates. Normally I would go to a place a few times before reviewing it but this one was obvious from the first impression.  While it's striving for a Mediterranean bar/restaurant experience nothing whatsoever about it is dialed in to the level of detail that needs to be to pull this off. I know of what I speak because I am from the capital of places just like this in California. No, not LA, a much snootier town than LA with more restaurants like this per square inch than anywhere in the world outside of Ibiza.  We ordered four or five small plates including flatbread, phyllo, and others that we can't remember (the menu has changed in the last month). The flatbread and phyllo were bland and I noted at the time that the flatbread had a number of fresh ingredients and that it seemed impossible that one could not make something good tasting out of them. I wondered if the chef or whoever was cooking may have an impaired sense of taste. The ingredients were there and everything seemed made from scratch but nothing tasted like anything.  Our server was incredibly nervous and checked in with us about 20 times. It was awkward because there was only one other table on the side of the patio we were on and that table had its own server. So the servers had not a lot to do but harass the few diners there. It felt like a place where the manager was blaming the lack of customers on the servers not being aggressive enough.   Where I was sitting there was a string of hugely distracting ants on the stucco wall at my back that made me a bit worried as to whether or not they'd deem my small plates worthy of a scouting trip. No such luck as it turned out.   Finally the live band in the center of the courtyard adjacent to the restaurant was one of the best live jazz bands I've ever heard! They were playing a Reinhardt/Grappelli song as well or better than Reinhardt and Grappelli! That band salvaged what otherwise would have been a grim experience. I regret that I didn't ask for the band's card if I should ever need to hire a band. If anyone knows, please post the name of the band and where they play around town.  BUT even though it seemed that Bodega had hired the band to play, the canned music inside Bodega was so loud that it was competing with the live music for those sitting closest to the live music on the patio. And the servers with nothing to do didn't notice this. And neither did whoever was in charge that night.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I will preface this with that fact that my rating is in comparison to other fine dining restaurants on the same scale, not limited to the area. I made reservations well in advance for a special occasion dinner (1st anniversary). This is a place I wanted to try for a long time, but it's difficult justifying the prices just for a night out. Since I made the reservations on Open Table and have read about issues where reservations didn't exist/get processed and it was a special occasion, I wanted to be sure the reservations were confirmed, so I called. I spoke to Stephen and explained this was a special occasion and we'd like to be seated in a quieter, romantic area. His response was that they were very busy at that time and he couldn't guarantee anything. I called again asking if we could bring our own wine/champagne and although they declined, assured us they had an extensive wine/champagne list. Anticipating the typical pretentiousness of a restaurant of this caliber, we were surprised to discover there was no valet parking. We were seated in a large high celling, wood floor, windowed ""atrium"" type room - colder, more noisy and casual than the other section of the restaurant. We then looked at the ""extensive"" wine list, which was mediocre at best. While it is extensive (meaning a lot of wines), the vintner/vintage/year of the wines was really lacking so we settled for glasses of very average wine rather than paying 3-4 times the price for wine we could purchase at Costco. We ordered lamb/brie and and crimini mushroom appetizers. Both were lukewarm, perhaps indicating they had been sitting under a warmer long after they were prepared. The lamb/brie appetizer had good flavor. The crimini mushroom appetizer was dreadful. The mushrooms were incredibly small and lacking flavor. Presentation was ok, but I expected better, again, for a restaurant of this caliber. The bisque, a highlight, and the salad were both good. The service was slow and also not what I would have expected. The busgirl felt it necessary to disclose she had been working since 7:00 a.m. and although personable and pleasant, a little chatty, perhaps from being overly tired. The server seemed distracted and inattentive, although it didn't seem that busy (the tables were not full). We ordered the rack of lamb chef's special and crab cakes for entrees. Again, both were OK, but served luke warm and lacking anything special as far as flavor and presentation. And the evening was rounded out with average desserts of creme brulee, a berry cobbler, a mediocre cognac (due to limited selections) and a fantastic Iniskillin ice wine (the other highlight). The entire experience was completely underwhelming and while we still enjoyed ourselves because of the occasion, the restaurant certainly did not live up to expectations, other reviewers ratings or the reputation they have ad it certainly wasn't due to volume because at no point in time, during the 3.5 hours we were there was every table full. In addition to the above, I felt we were overdressed, based on the fact that the men at the table next to us were in casual pants and jean jackets, as if they just stepped off the farm. We'll go to Philly next time for special occasion dinners. I certainly wouldn't recommend this restaurant for a special occasion to anyone I know!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Our expectations weren't set very high for this place, as we frequented the previous restaurant at this location and saw that go downhill when the new management took over.  We were pleasantly surprised when we saw the new Decor, and our service seemed very much on point.  First, we were very disappointed in the house margarita, which is similar to a skinny margarita a very common drink I order at places such as Besito. The drinks were just way off but they took so long, it wasn't worth ordering another drink.  Our friends ordered the chicken & pork tacos which seemed very high-priced for the lack of flavor.  The salsa variety that came with the chips were very good, but the chips were too salty.  My husband and I ordered seafood dishes, flavorful but with skin on it.... and also did not have any sort of garnish or side.... which for the price seemed much too high. I asked about the street corn side but the server was not recommending it, which I appreciate, if it's not very good.  Just a bit of a let down, but hopefully they'll read the reviews and make some modifications!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The Munch Factory was selected by my daughter who graduated on 05/11 from one of the universities. She bragged on their food. She made reservations a month in advance for after graduation brunch for her family and friends. While making reservations the gentleman asked her 3 times to repeat her name and he apparently still didn't write it down. My daughter and her 10 guest (all from out of town) was told by the staff that they had no reservations for that day. The restaurant is small and after waiting 1.5 hr we still couldn't be seated, it was told to us by staff that there was only one cook and he was about 20 dishes behind. Although we were served free appetizers it just couldn't make up for the disappointment my daughter was feeling. Unfortunately we never got served and the staff didn't seem to care less whether we stayed or left. The city was packed that day so after that we weren't very successful in finding a meal...most of the family left the city hungry and my daughter spent most of the afternoon crying.

"I recently moved to West Philly and have been ordering from here for a little while. While they do have very good General Tso's chicken (it's nice and sweet, has good texture and flavor), almost everything else I have ordered from them has been terrible.  I ordered chicken chow mein for my most recent order, expecting crispy noodles and some veggies and chicken, but what I got didn't resemble this at all: there were no noodles, the chicken's texture and flavor was that of boiled chicken, the only vegetables included were cabbage and onion, all in a strangely viscous yellow-green sauce.   My girlfriend ordered pork yat mein, which was even worse than the chow mein: greasy, mustard yellow gravy, bad flavor, etc.  Unfortunately I won't be ordering from them again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I was shocked when they said that we couldn't have sauce on the side. What is that about!?  Especially when I see that you have solo condiment cups sitting off to the side!  The chicken enchilada had more potatoes than anything else. And overall, they were warm at best. I will say that the staff was exceptionally polite!  They were friendly and welcoming.

"We have been long time customers. We were seated today at 1:20pm and the food finally arrived at 2pm. I always order Chicken Milano and it's usually outstanding. Today, dry chicken and no butter lemon sauce ( see photo). My wife had veal parm and we both asked to substitute fettuccine alfredo for our side. Usually some kind of up charge, no problem. Today our waitress came back ten minutes after taking the order and told us it would be $8.00. We said no problem.  She stated that it was a really big portion. As you can see in the photo its a handful. My wife's side was linguine alfredo. So, 40 plus minute wait for lunch. Dry chicken with no sauce and $8.00 for a tiny side of fettuccine and a $3 up charge for linguine alfredo? Bill was $61.00 with two cokes. $73.00 with 20% for the waitress regardless of the wait. We drove from Clearwater because this is one of our favorite places. Today, was a let down and after many years we are now wondering if we would recommend Iavarone's or go back.

My husband and I came here for dinner and it was just okay. We had to wait quite a long time for a server to come and take our drink/food order. However once she arrived she was very friendly. We had a Caesar salad to start which for $9 I had expected it to be a little bigger. For our entrees I had the Ravioli ($18.95) and my husband had the spaghetti ($18.95). The portion size was okay nothing huge. Again for the price I expected to get a little more. The flavors of our entrees were good. Our bill was $50 (not including beverages) and I just thought that I could get food just as good at the Olive Garden but for a way better price.

"We were looking for a seafood spot to eat at our last night in Tampa. When we yelped the reviews we thought it was a win. But oh how wrong we were. This isn't as a great as the reviews lead you to believe.  The building looks like a hole in the wall. The decor is a cheap version of Red Lobster.  The wait staff were pleasant and welcoming. Happy Hour is all day everyday so that was a plus  The menu didn't look too appealing for me. A lot of fried foods.  We ordered the Buffalo Shrimp as an appetizer. They were good when crunchy. They also came with chips on the bottom which my husband raved about.  We also ordered the onion rings which were fried well but tasted not so good. I took a bite and was done with it. My husband didn't even finish them! Which is a shock cause he eats everything lol!  As for the entree we had the Seafood Pasta or something along those lines. It had mussels, clams, shrimp and scallops. The pasta was flavorful but I was petrified I'd get food poisoning just based on a crunch I had while eating it.

"Shawarmageddon may offer solid food, but the service leaves much to be desired. Upon entering, we heard the employees yell at each other to tone it down, as customers were there. They continued to blast music and cuss loudly at each other. I realize this concept doesn't give the indication it's a calm and quiet operation, but it was a bit much. After ordering, we waited almost twenty minutes in an otherwise empty restaurant before we found every employee outside taking a break. Our food made and waiting inside, they had forgotten to hand it over and left the music blaring while they headed outside. An honest mistake, perhaps, but pretty inexcusable. Complimentary tea was offered as an apology, which was appreciated. The food itself was mixed, as the tabbouleh and falafel were only mildly seasoned and severely lacking herbs. The pickled veggies and sauces, however, were flavorful and buoyed the meal. They offer three sauces per entree, and I'd suggest to take advantage of that offer. The teas were also much more mild than I expected from such an in-your-face concept, and while the donuts were a fun finish to the meal they were rather bland without the orange blossom frosting.  Shawarmageddon succeeds at sauces but should spread some seasoning to the bulk of the meal. And until service is improved, I don't think I'll be returning.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"You can enjoy a wide variety of selections from Western foods to Asian foods.  They are pretty delicious. However, they have a system where you eat first and pay later. If you are a senior citizen or you are with a senior citizen, make sure you spell it out and tell them that. Otherwise, they will not give you a senior citizen discount even if it's obvious that you are a senior citizen or you are with a senior citizen. i found out later when I looked at my bill that they didn't give my mom  who is a senior citizen a discount, even though we mentioned it to them earlier, and even though they could see that my mom is in her 80s.  I find this a bit dishonest that they didn't subtract the discount from the billl. So, I called them about it and explained what  they did. They were aware and willing to give us the discount. That would just cause such inconvenience for my mom and all the parties involved were already home.  The point is that they should not do that because it's not good customer service.

"Recently went for my wife's birthday, after we had not been there in about 2 years.   The good:  They have nice dining areas, very pretty and one of those increasingly rare nice restaurants that's not trying to be a pub or slow fast food, just a classic place.   The OK:  The food was just ok.  The portions are a bit small, I got the seafood paella was pretty weak, rice is cheap to put in and this barely had any.  Nothing was memorable about the food or it's execution and it took forever to come out we were there over 2 hours and no the drinks were not flowing...which brings me to... The ugly: Some of the worst service I have had in awhile.  The server, a fellow who's name starts with a B would probably not be capable to work in a McDondalds.  Asked a question about a wine, his response was ""I have no idea what that wine is.  The food service was slow and we had to tell him we wanted to order, he did not ask even after sitting for 15 mins, yes we do want to order food!  But the worst was the amount of time this guy spent on his cell phone.  Right within view this guy is checking his phone, then answering his phone, and even making a call!  He dropped our check, walked 10 feet away and actually whipped the phone out and called somebody.  I don't see that a fast food place let alone a place I am dropping over 100 bucks at, and maybe that was why I our food was coming out so slow Needless to say it's not Bs fault, it's who ever is managing him, training him(or rather not training on wines) and hiring him.

"I love Bangkok cuisine.  I have been loving their food for years.  I would give them 5 stars but the service is so spotty.  Some days they are fast, some days they are nearly empty and still super slow.  This review in particular is about takeout I got the other day.  We have a 3 year old that dos not do spicy so we ordered soy sauce noodle and pumpkin curry with ZERO stars.  In my mind that means no spice.  My husband loves the spice, I'm ok with it but nothing above a 2.  So we get our food home and go to start eating only to have the curry be too hot for even me and the soy sauce noodle just tolerable.  This means we have to listen to the toddler, who wouldn't just trust us that it was too spicy, freak out about the spice and then again about needing something different to eat.  Not a big deal, the world keeps turning.  The reason why it bothered me so bad this time is because when I called to let them know how off the spice level was the girl said nothing.  When I then commented that I just wanted to call and let you know she said ""thanks"".  Which in my book is akin to ""I don't give a crap, F-off"".

"Located in the French quarter, we came here for the oysters since there is a long time at Acme. Plus, there is happy hour specials on oysters, about $1 each. We tried the grilled oysters but I did not like it at all. It has some cheese on it, which tastes like parmesan cheese. We also ordered ceviche, which tasted nothing like ceviche. It was not sour at all. More like cutted up shrimps in an orange juice marinade. I didn't think there were any fish in it til the husband pointed it out, okay, so maybe 4 tiny pieces of fish. Does not have much of a taste to it.  I also ordered boiled and chilled shrimp which I thought was a shrimp cocktail but I was wrong. When it came out, it was headed shrimps with skins on. If I knew it was like that, I would not have ordered it. It was not what I expected nor tasted fresh at $2 a shrimp. The frozen cooked shrimps at the grocery store tasted way better than this.  The only thing good here was the fresh oysters at $1 each. Service is good. Food is not good (For the price) except for the raw oysters.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

It's a better place to go to drink and listen/dance to music. Every time I try to give this place another chance, I get disappointed. What frustrates me the most is the service.

I politely informed him that I did not have one. He rolled his eyes, tilted his head, and glared at me and said ""really? In a snarky attitude, as if i were lying.

"From the reviews, it seems like the food is probably fine, but I was really grossed out by the fried cheesecake I got during my last visit, so I'm not sure I'd want to stop in again. Also, the air was foggy with grease particles, which invaded my hair and clothes and made me smell like fried chicken after I left the restaurant. They should probably fix the kitchen vent.   I came in because I was excited to try this new and interesting addition to South Street. I was especially intrigued by the fried cheesecake, which looked gorgeous from other reviewers' pictures. When I came in, the service was not particularly friendly, but I didn't mind that too much. At $8.51 (incl. tax and tip), I thought the fried cheesecake was a bit pricey, but I wanted to try it anyway for the novelty.   But when it emerged from the kitchen, I was really disappointed to see a really small, crooked slice of fried cheesecake with oily/soggy crumbs falling off, topped with hastily drizzled chocolate syrup. I also noticed that the cheesecake slice was placed diagonally lengthwise on the plate, with two sets of round fruits placed squarely on the wider end, giving the overall appearance of an erect you-know-what. Perhaps that was unintentional, but it definitely turned me off. (In the photo I included with this review, you will see that I rotated the cheesecake slice 90 degrees clockwise for a classier effect, but that is not how it was originally plated.)   Even then, I would not have minded the price and appearance of this dessert if it actually tasted good, but instead of creamy, the cheesecake was rubbery, and it was very greasy from being fried. The accompanying dragon fruit and rambutan were weakly flavored, so they did not really add much to the dish. If anything, they added an unpleasant flavor contrast. It was altogether a very unpleasant experience - dessert and otherwise. I am not sure if I'll be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Perhaps we did a poor job ordering, but this was the least memorable meal of my four-day visit to New Orleans. Bland food and overpriced, IMO. I'm not sure why this place was two-thirds full at 2pm Saturday, given the other options in the neighborhood.  Maybe we were supposed to order pizza? Maybe we caught it at an off-time.  Loved the patio seating (perfect for splitting a few pitchers on a warm afternoon), but unfortunately it was full, and so we took a seat in the (extremely dark) front dining room. Our server was slow and rarely to be found... Fine, just bring us the food. But the grub--all three dishes at our table--was underwhelming, too.  I would've rather had another shrimp po'boy.  Bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. Usually I can handle this, but they were nasty to the extent I briefly wondered whether it'd be safe to order food here. I let the presence of other diners reassure me it'd be safe. Hey, but they do have hot water (when you wash your hands, watch out for it)!

"The entire restaurant was filthy.  Napkins, straws, rice, and various food remnants strewn over the entire floor and none of the tables were clean.  Every customer before, during, and while we were leaving had to choose a filthy table to eat at.  We were able to find a table not covered in dishes and since a dirty table was the only option we sat down to eat.   Our food did arrive within several minutes minus the pot stickers.  We let the runner know we were waiting on them.  Ten minutes later no appetizer.  We enjoyed the thai inspired noodle dishes just fine.  My significant other asked for a refund for the missing item and we finished eating.  Manager gave us coupon for free bowl. Awesome,  right? After I was done,  I needed a plastic to go container and went back up to the front and was completely ignored by not one but three employees. The managers were not in view at this time.  Only one of these employees was assisting a customer.   After waiting and waiting I sat back down.   My s.o. went and got me one and spoke to the manager (not positive he was the assistant or manager) about how filthy the place was and how service was  terrible.  The manager proceeded to offer him a job and to let us know that he was in a hurry to get home to his crying children. The assistant manager asked if she could give us anything and he said no and he just wanted to share some obvious bit of advice.  They both seemed strung out on cocaine and completely incapable of representing/running any business. Seriously WIPE THE TABLES OFF!  I would never go back.

"I won't go on a rant right now about how Publix is such a better grocery store than Schnucks because then I'll really miss Florida, but this Schnucks is... not great. It's not about the employees, who are fairly friendly (although somewhat hard to find if you have a question).   I'm giving this Schnucks a 2 because of the layout. It's probably the most confusing and logic-defying layout I've experienced at a grocery store before. The whole store is basically divided in half by the alcohol and bakery section forming a sort of awkward barrier, so that when you're trying to go from the produce section to the rest of the store, you have to go through the alcohol or to the back of the store past the bread. Also, the frozen aisles and the other dry goods aisles are set perpendicular to each other. How does that make any sense?   In any case, I try to avoid this Schnucks as much as possible unless I happen to be in this plaza because of the gym and I need to pick up a few grocery items on the way home. I usually do most of my grocery shopping at Aldi, Shop 'n Save, or super Walmart every once in a while (if there are other miscellaneous items I have to get). Schnucks is lower down on my list because it's pricier, but this I end up here sometimes due to sheer convenience.   So to summarize, I personally don't like this Schnucks because of the very strange and super not intuitive layout, but really, it's a first world problem and the actual products and employees here are fine, even if it is more expensive than Aldi.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Miguel's south Reno location left a lot to be desired when we recently ate there. When we walked in and got to where we check in, nobody was there for a few minutes. Just as we were about to leave to find a different place to eat, someone came and got us to our table.   The decor within the restaurant was fun and provided plenty to look at until our server got to us. We ordered and our server was not all that great. She read our orders back to us but got them completely wrong. We got them corrected and waited for our food to show up. I got a burrito that was massive but wasn't made very well. It almost seemed like it was assembled in a strange way where I could only get just beans, just rice, just meat or, at the end, just salsa and sour cream which I'd hoped to avoid. My wife got Fajitas and the meat part of the fajitas was mostly onions and not much meat which was disappointing. Both meals were fairly bland and flavorless.  We didn't order Margaritas but their menu looked good and someone at a nearby table ordered one and it looked massive.

"I hate to do it but I have to knock these guys down a notch. This will be my one and only with them and believe me I do not like giving 1-2 stars however observations from today must go on all the time. A 2 to me is below average and this was.   Inside decor I really could care less about for a ""deli"" so the mafia posters, old tv, dusty wall near the Coke machine and pink tables did not deduct a point.   When I entered there was one customer the owner was bantering with (the only customer) After a few minutes of not being acknowledged I finally realized where a menu was which was taped to the counter.   I ordered a pressed Italian steamroller. Got my money out and he never said another word. Never took my money. Never told me to take a seat. Guessing they would start my sub and get the money I decided I guess you pay after and sat down. A few more minutes went by and a nice lady ( believe the owners wife ) provided me said sub.   If the sub did not have the oil lettuce banana peppers etc it would have been so dried out that you would not have been able to bite through the bread. Luckily the large amount of oil rehydrated half of the crouton I was biting into. Since there was never mention or offer of a drink you can imagine it was not an enjoyable experience. They purchase boars head brand meats like most local delis bread was not good for a press it should have been wrapped in foil to keep hydrated absolutely nothing special about this sub that one could not make in their own oven much better.   While half way through I was about to get up and nine fireman (thank you for your service) came in. So now I have to wait for these guys to order before I can pay. It's not like I wanted to start a tab and possibly order another sub. This is beyond aggravating.   Then as I am waiting to pay the owner shouts to the lady what did this guy get so he knows how much to charge me?  You took my order. Ring me up right then. Or ask me what I ordered. Trust me I am not trying to sneak one by the local sub shop.   A few other observations. A couple came in after me one ordered a tuna sub. She was asked if she could wait or order something different as they did not make the tuna yet. Glad to see they make their own but it is 11:55 and you service a lunch crowd.   Of the nine fireman they ordered 4 Cubans and 5 steamrollers. Took the owner a few extra minutes to figure that out before I was allowed to finally get up and pay.   They seem to have a following. Seem to get a lot of call aheads.

The interior has a few tables to eat, but it's mainly a takeout place. It does seem like an older building and area... The workers were extremely nice and polite. Pricing was pretty reasonable as well.  Now for the food... We ordered the Sesame Chicken Combo which includes fried rice and an egg roll.   Sesame Chicken - The portion was HUGE, but it just did not taste right. The sauce was extremely thick and too sweet. Imagine mixing sugar, ketchup, and soy sauce - That's what it tasted like.  Fried Rice - The rice had a terrible burnt taste to it. Either the oil or pan was old. There was no distinct flavor besides smoke/char.  Egg roll - It was sooooo greasy.

One of the freestyle dispenser was out of service and was leaking water all over the floor.

"This place is an utter utter mess.   First off, this restaurant doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a Chicago food restaurant, New Orleans, New Mexico, or something else? I have no clue. Apparently the cook has traveled around the U.S. finding unique foods in those cities and brought their food to Saint Louis. I'll agree that New Orleans and Chicago have some stand out flavors and foods, but SERIOUSLY? The two cities are so far apart when it comes to food that the concept doesn't make any sense. What I do know is that Cathy's Kitchen had no idea what it wanted to be and decided to be less than unique. I am also curious how their Chicago deep dish pizza is, but I'm too afraid to try it, because I fear I'll be waiting 2 hours for it.  The food...My dish, which was the Chicago Hotdog is still making my tummy ache 9 hours later.  I honestly saw nothing on the menu I wanted to order, but figured that they can't really get a Chicago dog wrong...Well, I was wrong. On top of that my fries were terrible. Corn starched bland fries. Oh dear, serves me right for ordering processed food.  The group I was with had generally good things to say about their dishes, so I can't really give Cathy's Kitchen 1 star. However, nobody had anything good to say about their service.  For whatever reason, after we ordered our dishes, they took at least half an hour to arrive. You would think they'd have arrived together, but no, not at Cathy's Kitchen. First the burger arrived, then the mussels about 5 minutes later, then my chicago dog 5 minutes later, and so on and so forth. The last person at our table sat watching us eat for at least 10-15 minutes before his food came out. Terrible. I think we spent at least an hour and a half at Cathy's Kitchen, mostly waiting for our food.  Another thing I should mention is that you're not going to walk out of Cathy's Kitchen smelling nice. The grill and cooking area is right in view of all the customers and you're going to come out smelling pretty gross all day.   As you can see, I am not a big fan. In fact, while I think De-Lish, another restaurant in the area is going downhill, they're still a million times better than Cathy's Kitchen.   Sorry Cathy's Kitchen, I don't know where all those 4 star reviews are coming from (people with only a couple of reviews...yea kinda shady), but it certainly isn't from me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Order here about once a month because they are the closest pizza shop that I can place an online order. I usually order through Yelp, and pay through the app as well. Unfortunately the convenience isn't always trouble free. A few months ago, I ordered online and paid online, but when the delivery driver came, he said that his records showed that it was not prepaid, so I paid the driver. After he left, I checked my bank account and saw that I was indeed charged for the original order. I called, and the driver returned my money, so that was resolved. But I recently had another issue when I ordered a pizza online. My girlfriend went to pick up the pizza, and when she got home, I noticed that the pizza did not have any of the toppings I ordered/paid for. I called the shop, and the girl who answered was clueless, and transferred me to her manager. The manager said that the online order was not processed correctly to the kitchen. I asked if they could deliver the correct pizza, and I would return the original because the mistake was their fault. He stated that I would have to pay for delivery if I wanted that. When I said I didn't want to pay delivery, he said that he could discount me in the future. He never gave me his name, or any coupon code. All he said was that he worked nights.....

I chose grilled vegetables, and while the soup itself was hot, flavorful, and well spiced, there were no grilled vegetables.  The vegetables were raw and dumped in the soup, they were not even chopped properly.  There were huge raw chunks of broccoli and bell pepper that wouldn't even fit in my mouth.  And then there was the Larb...horrendous!!  The beef was so salty it was inedible, it actually burned my mouth.  When I told the server about the poor flavor, he was apologetic and took it off the bill, although he also tried to tell me that it was supppsed to taste that way...fyi, I've had that dish over 20 times in authentic Thai restaurants and it is definitely not supposed to taste that way!!

I wanted to like this place, honest. However, the extremely long delivery time (over an hour on a Sunday at 3pm) was just the beginning of my disappointment. What I can say is that the vegetables were fresh and the bowl I think was a very good size despite other reviewer complaints. The ""Arnold Palmer"" was not actually Arnold Palmer, it was some kind of housemade version I guess? Tasty but extremely small and not worth the $2.75. The hummus was good but a little spicy, the pita chips were chewy which wasn't great. The baked falafel didn't do it for me: Extremely dry, oddly spicy, mostly unpleasant. The salad was extremely over seasoned. They all, including the bed of spinach, were extremely overrun with herbs. What's worse is I couldn't even pinpoint what I was tasting. Some kind of mint tarragon mix? Not sure but it was overpowering and made my food inedible. Even the balsamic dressing wasn't even to mask the taste.

"Let me start off by saying my wife and I love this place! I can easily say we're here twice a week. Unfortunately our past visit wasn't one of the best. I hate the fact I have to give a 2 star review.  We arrived just after opening around 11am and we're sat immediately lol. The waitress whom we had a few times in the past was great as usual. The beer selection is always on point and the food is usually the same. Every time we go we like to have something different.  We started with the mozzarella sticks, amazing!! They were really delicious, but you only get 3. My opinion is it should be 4 especially if your sharing the appetizer. I ordered the turkey panini. Meh, it was kind of boring. The turkey was fresh, it did had Swiss and a small amount of cole slaw but It was very dry. My wife ordered the veggie pita. She was so pumped when it arrived, looked delicious! Unfortunately there was an 8 inch hair in it. My wife didn't notice it right away. It was such a bummer, we always said we never had a bad meal here. The waitress was apologetic and stated the chef would make a new one. Great! They did just that but we were on a lunch break and my wife had to eat alone.  I understand that these things happen but my biggest dilemma is it should have been taken off the bill and it was not. And no manager came over to apologize, that can go a long way. We will go back, just not sure when. I'm posting some pictures of our previous meals",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We have eaten here before and enjoyed it, this time not so much. I got the fried grouper sandwich and while I have enjoyed fish sandwiches and grouper in particular before, this one had an objectionable fishy flavor that I couldn't get past. My wife sitting across the table commented on the smell. The staff graciously exchanged it and I got the Portobello sandwich which had the opposite problem, no flavor.  The fries they serve are coated fries undoubtedly that come in a big bag frozen. While good, I would have preferred fresh cut fries.

"I have been patronizing Steak 'N Shake for more years than I can remember, and I am in my mid-fifties. I visited this store about three months ago, and ordered my favorite steakburger and fries, and I have been here many times. I also asked for some A-1 steak sauce, but the server said that it was no longer available! What? I have ALWAYS had A-1! She thought it was a corporate decision that was at least district-wide. I ate my steakburger plain, and later phoned in my comments to the toll-free number on the receipt. The call-taker had not heard of this change, and promised a follow-up response, which I never received.   Then, after almost three months, I just went to a different and also nearby Steak 'N Shake, again one that I have been to many times. The first thing I said to the server was, ""Do you have A-1 steak sauce?"" And she said, ""Yes, of course! I'll bring you extra!""  She had heard nothing about eliminating A-1.   I thought SNS had an A-1 steakburger on their menu. I felt a bit cheated at the first store, wondered why I never received a follow-up, and could never put ketchup on a steakburger. So, beware!

Now they are $18 a dozen. I was going to order the beer battered fish. Comes with a side and a salad for $12.99. However the majority won. We headed to the old tried and true, Rusty Belly's. We ordered much larger oysters at a much cheaper price. And the drinks average about $1.50 each cheaper as well. Sorry Lagerheadz but your prices have gotten a little too high for me.

"Honest review from a local. You need local biz esp during Rona times. Your waitstaff has been trained to ""upsell"" everything. I have no respect to trust a server's recommendations when they only point out the highest priced items on the menu. Also, we order higher-priced beverages and they asked for us to upgrade on each drink order. Tried pushing the ""special"" instead of what we wanted even after ordering. Short pours on wine even when questioned on this fact. Another server even admitted the manager short poured on the expensive wine.

"We've been doing business with Chris's for several years now. The pizza has always been hot, fresh, and to our specs. We became a fan of the wings also and usually order both. I like cajun and my wife the BBQ. But, recently the wings have taken a nosedive. I'm not sure who decided smaller wings would go unnoticed, but I'm telling you they would be more suited for the children's wing order. While I typically don't go around giving two-star reviews, reviews are necessary today so people can be aware of where to get the most for your money. If you want a great pizza, Chris's can hook you up. But if you wish to have some real wings, do like we'll do from now on and hit up the Publix deli.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Came to veda for restaurant week and was surprised to find such a large and elegant restaurant. My friend and I were excited for our meal, though were quickly disappointed by the quality of food that came out.  We ordered the spicy paneer quesadillas, pork ribs, crispy spinach chaat, and bacon naan to start. The pork ribs had a nice flavor though were dry and overcooked. The paneer quesadillas were flavorless and a little soggy. Bacon naan was not very flavorful, and neither was the spinach chaat (I still think indeblue does this best). I ordered the shrimp curry and my friend ordered the chicken tikka, both of which were pretty standard. The saving grace of the meal was their dessert. My friend enjoyed her gulab jamon with rose ice cream, and I loved the kulfi! Probably one of my favorite desserts in philly.  Overall a fairly disappointing experience redeemed by their dessert.

It's not really a pizza ""buffet."" A couple of pizzas are placed on a counter under some heat lamps which don't keep the pizza hot. Our pizza slices were close to room temperature. Also, I would not describe the pizza we had as deep dish but more like thick crust.   Some of the pictures posted here make the pizza look way better than the pizza we had. Atleast one other person has questioned whether the pizza served on the pizza ""buffet"" is different than the pizza ordered off of the regular menu. If so, not a good way to get people to come back.

"Since Fort Taco opened, my coworkers and I have given them lots of business. Personally, I buy lunch there at least twice a week. The tacos are great, the service is good. Until today.   I hate tomatoes. I would really love to love them, but it's just not going to happen. I've ordered the same item without tomatoes many times, with an occasional mishap. Last week, both of my lunches were wrong - the wrong sauce and/or the wrong meat. Same thing with yesterday. Normally, I just suck it up, but enough is enough, and how many other people are getting the wrong food? Today at the drive-through, I spoke to the owner's wife who was working the window and told her about it. She's a delightful person whom I've built a nice rapport with over the months. She said she would personally look out for my orders.   Nope. Wrong meat. That's 5 orders in a row in less than 2 weeks.   So, thinking she would answer the phone, I called the store to let her know. I had intended to laugh it off with her, until the ""manager and part owner"" who answered the phone wrecked it. He refused to let me speak with her, and then he questioned me about my order as though I was the one who screwed up my order. He was really quite rude about it, and his attitude made me angry. I'm the customer - when I don't get what I ordered, that's not my fault. He wanted me to drive the taco back to him so he could see it, but I was already back at work and my lunch was over. I asked him what he was going to do to make it better, and he had no answer. I said ""So, not even a free taco?"", and he said ""Oh, yeah. I'll put you on the list.""   Sadly, this doesn't bode well for Fort Taco receiving much of my future business, which sucks because it's the best place for lunch around my office. It's also the only locally owned, and I love to support local business. It's not hard, Fort Taco.  Just give the customer what they ordered and if there's a problem, lay off the 'tude.

We sat down and were completely ignored for about 15 minutes, while plenty of servers were having full on conversations right next to our table.

I was prepared to move on from this and enjoyed the rest of my lunch if Cesar had taken over properly after the initial disaster, but he didn't. The Mac and cheese we ordered for our appetizer was deliver and he only checked on it when asked if he could bring my meal and I only saw him when he picked up the plates and when I had to ask him for the check.

We were seated quickly as the restaurant was empty and our appetizer came out fast as well. Honestly the food was good. Calimari was ok I've had better but the pasta and sauces were delicious. My issue is with the unprofessionalism by the staff.  After paying and leaving the restaurant we were full of warm carbohydrates and decided to go for a walk before driving back home. As we went around the corner of the restaurant we were confronted by our server who had a tray of drinks in his hands and while serving other guest had yelled out to my husband who was behind us ""just so you know they never left a tip!""   Apparently my friends used a groupon to pay and between the confusion of him taking both bills at separate times they forgot to leave gratuity. Honestly our server was very short with us I felt a little rushed like he kept wanting to take the plates since they closed in an hour but really I always tip 20% when I go out, I know it's their main income.  Basically, I ended up going inside and giving him all of my cash that I had in my wallet $6.00 to tip the man and it was an accident that he wasn't tipped. They didn't do it on purpose they thought the groupon had gratuity added. Anyhow, I was very turned off by the other nasty remarks that were made by friends of another server that were standing by and verbally attacking us. I won't go on about it but even though the food was good I will not be returning due to the unprofessional staff that most likely misrepresented the restaurant. I am deeply disappointed. Even if my friends did not want to tip truthfully that is their business. It is not professional to trash talk a paying customer in front of other patrons.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"So to start this review off, I will say the place has a good vibe and a good setup! Tight, but what's the harm in double dating with strangers? Sarcasm...  Staff wasn't that nice and just got you in and out as fast as possible - they wanted a quick turn over. Food wasn't that great either. The pasta was solid but you could probably make better at home. Not good Italian food at all. Just go down to south philly for something more authentic.   So I saved the best part of the review for last: VEAL MEDALIANS IN MARSALA SAUCE. I just ate a roast beef sandwich for lunch today. Good quality meat from Wegmens, but lunch meat nonetheless. My Veal Marsala literally tasted like that same exact lunch meat, but with some non-Marsala tasting gravy sitting on top. Literally, WTF!!! Very thin, makes you question the quality for $23, and the taste, like I said, reminds me of lunch meat.   Overall, wanted to give 1 star, but our 4th server (Houdini 2.0) cracked some funny jokes and didn't pour wine into my water glass.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This place offers a lot of fun and a great atmosphere.  However, the staff, or should I say, the lack there of could use some work.  After purchasing game cards we realized we could have purchased a better deal.  Some guidance would have been nice if offered by the hostesses at the entrance.    We moved onto the restaurant after gaming.  It was my sons birthday so I asked the host about what they do for birthdays, for example the wait staff singing with a piece of cake.  She very rudely said, ""We don't do anything your gonna have to ask your server!""  A simple sorry we don't do that here would have been better.    My server who was VERY nice (Tammy) said I could order a dessert and they'd bring it out with a candle.  I did that.  It took forever, as did our food, and there was no candle.  Go at nighttime.

"Krewe Du Brew was dissapointing - I was expecting a really good cup of coffee to get a sub-par, burnt espresso. I very rarely throw lattes away, and I ended up throwing this away on the way back to my hotel. The menu wasn't really varied and the shop was a bit dated in its decor. Very little ambiance - just a run of the mill coffee stop with a very pissed off barista who wouldn't take the time of day to wait for my order (although there wasn't anyone else in the shop too!) NOLA has other great coffee establishments, so I'd say skip this and try another.

"We made an early dinner reservation for Father's Day, and seated shortly after arriving. They were fairly busy, but not as full as I've seen in the past. The warm bread was good, and the entrée's were ok. The steak I had was cooked fine, but a bit tough. The real surprise was the people at the table next to us were seated ~15 minutes after we were, yet they received their food ~5 to 10 minutes before us. The guy commented that we should complain about the wait until he realized they had food, but nothing to eat with. After trying to flag down three different people working there, one of the manager's came over with their utensils.

"We went there, tonight, and were quickly reminded why we do not generally go to this location.  While the food was good, the service was not even mediocre.  I believe we sat for at least 10 minutes once we were seated before we finally flagged the host down to let him know our server had not come by for drinks.  That was pretty much how things went.  All three of us were empty for a while before we were able to find our server again and request refills on our drinks.  I am not sure if there is poor management in the front of the house, if our server was spread too thin, or ????  There are too many options for patrons to consider to provide such lackluster service.  On the bright side, I did really enjoy the quesadilla explosion salad - the quesadilla, which I usually do not ever get one, had an extra sort of crispy / fried taste feel to it that let me know I was going to like this, but it was likely not even close to healthy, despite being served alongside a salad.  My wife really likes the shrimp tacos, too, which is one of her go-to dishes at Chili's.  I enjoyed the mango flavored tea, too!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"The only reason this review isn't one star, is because my filet tasted great.  Overall this was a relatively horrible restaurant experience. In a nutshell, our party of six was disappointed. We were the first diners of the evening yet were told they were out of prosciutto off the appetizer menu. Then we were told that they were sold out of the wine we selected from their pretty meager wine list.   Unlike most steakhouses, they don't offer a variety of sides to order with your steak. Steak comes with the option of salad or potato or rice. I did order sautéed vegetables anyway. Finally, for dessert I asked for the crêpes without the cream and was told no I couldn't have it that way.    For being the only diners in the rather tiny restaurant, we didn't get prompt service.  Had to ask multiple Times for water and we asked for extra toppings but they didn't arrive until after all the bread was gone.  Furthermore, the table was tiny and low and I could barely fit my knees in my seating area. But the decor was nice!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"It's mediocre, that's really all I can say. The interior of the restaurant is a chaotic mess, but that's no sin because most of us are probably just there to pick up an order to go. The General Tso's chicken is bland and dry, a very unpleasant texture but the flavor wasn't too terrible. The so-called fried rice is very obviously just yellow rice mixed with barely any pieces of meat and lots of undercooked onion. The eggroll is small and overlooked, with an unremarkable filling.   I would consider this a reasonably inexpensive Chinese takeout place for people who don't know better. After eating here, I actually felt bad for anyone who considers this good Chinese food, because they're doing themselves a disservice by not going somewhere better.   Will not be returning here. Not because it's terrible, but just because there are much better options for Chinese takeout in the area; in terms of quality and value.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Maybe I just tried this place when they were having a bad day or perhaps I ordered the one bad menu choice. Whichever was true, I was completely disappointed in the food. The green corn tamale was solid masa, no cheese or corn in sight. The beef taco was flavorless and the taco shell was soggy and fell apart with the first bite. With an order of average guacamole and chips, my bill was over ten dollars and I had to pick up at the counter and eat out of a styrofoam carry out box. Even their famous tortilla was uninspiring, served in a plastic bag, wrapped around a plastic fork. There are many other places in Tucson for good Mexican food.

"The biggest problem here is the food. I ordered a simple tuna melt, food came and the tuna was cold and about one piece of cheese on the sandwich, which wasn't even melted.

And lastly, when it was time for us the order ice cream, instead of giving us a dessert menu, she just asked us what we wanted.  Now I have been to Friendly's before but years ago, so I had to jog my memory about what they had. The ice cream portions and toppings seem to be about cut in half of what it used to be 10 years ago, but I think that is with all Friendly's.

I'd put them on par with Rock Bottom, where all of the beers are drinkable and good, but not mind-blowing where I can't stop drinking the delicious ambrosia like I do at 4 Hands or Urban Chestnut.   Rum: I tried both their white and aged rum and they were both delicious. I bought a bottle of the aged to take home.  I would like to go back and order off of their regular menu.

Stay away from buffalo chicken sandwich, not the best sauce and I love buffalo flavors.    My experience was terrible. It was my first and will be my last. Heard so many great things about this place. Arrived at 530p on a Saturday, not too busy. We usually sit at the bar, but it was full so we were sat at a table. Multiple servers walked by even looking at us but none greeted us after several minutes. Finally, a guy approached and does the pretend thing where we are actually his table but apologizes no one has been to us but he'll take care of us. Mind you, it's not that busy as it wasn't a packed house. So he gets our drinks and orders right away. We didn't see him for a long time when we needed refills. I approach the hostess and as I'm telling her our situation the manager, Brittney was there and addressed our concerns. She was helpful the rest of our dining experience. The server never apologized from the get go nor for not getting refills on time or for getting our ""real"" server bc it probably was him. Barely checked on us. He had another table behind us and we saw him bring one a drink to them when he could have brought a refill same time to us! The manager did give us a complimentary dessert to help end our night and we just took it to go. The server said he didn't charge us for the sodas, which is good since he didn't keep up on the refills, but it isn't about that cost.

Feeling sweat trickle down your back is not a fun ""date"" night experience, however, the bar tender was adequate and the Pinot Nior was great.  We were sitting close to the door when we realized that walk-ins were being seated before us and we both thought that was incredibly rude.  After we were seated we both found the dining room temperature much more comfortable and the waiter came right up and got our drink order. My wife tried to order the Filet Don Pedro and was told it was unavailable so we both ordered the Espeto Misto. The food only took about 20 minutes to come out and was well presented.

"Giving it 2 stars since the owner redeemed himself at the end, otherwise it would be 1 or 0. Our Thanksgiving experience was so bad that our entire meal, including alcohol, was complimentary.  The host lady is absolute horrible. Rude and pretentious.  My husband and I went for a Thanksgiving dinner, priced at at $70 per person for a 3 course meal (several appetizers, entree and dessert). Reservation at 5:15 pm, got there 5 minutes earlier, place was pretty much empty (about 4 tables full in the back), meaning the entire main floor was EMPTY. After waiting almost 5 minutes for the host to get off the phone, she looked at us and with the rudest attitude ever, asked us: How can I help you? Humm, let me think... I want to buy baseball tickets..... She had the nerve to tell us, before even being seated, that we had to leave by 7:25. Well lady, if I am going to be spending at least $300 in my Thanksgiving meal, you don't tell me what time I have to leave. Right after that, with the whole restaurant being empty, she took us outside to the balcony, in a very cold night, to be seated in the dark and with no other patrons around. I refused and asked to be seated inside. We sat for 10 minutes and she placed another couple right next to us, with the whole place been EMPTY at 5:30 pm.  The menu stated that for $ 70 you get ""appetizers for the table"", one choice of entree and a dessert. Reality: one appetizer, one entree and no dessert. Waiter told us to ignore the menu. IGNORE IT? Not to have our Thanksgiving ruined, we just ordered one appetizer each, and our main entrees. We were still eating our appetizers and got our main course. At that point my husband, the calmest man on Earth, complained it and send it back. After that it took 45 minutes to get our entree. They realized and gave us a little complementary cognac. Food came and it was just ok. I have been a loyal patron at Little Door and Little Next Door for years in LA and the food is absolute superior than the Santa Barbara one. Once again, the waiter came and said that he didn't know why the menu mentioned dessert since it wasn't included.  At that point we just asked for the bill. I went ahead and asked to speak with the owner, just to tell him that his menu was completely misleading, when, to my surprise, he blamed on his printer in LA that printed the wrong version of the menu. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Then for the lack of service and tardiness, HE BLAMED ON HIS MEXICAN CREW THAT DIDN'T SHOW UP to work. Are you serious again? I don't need to know your employees nationality as if that you made it ok for my bad service. The lady on my right also complained to the waiter about the misleading menu, and as he looked at me, he said to her, oh just ignore it. WTF? Is not the money but the principal. Again, I am giving it 2 stars because the owner tried to make a better experience for us and didn't charge us at all. We left a $40 tip to a less than capable waiter (I won't ever bother to describe our interaction with him). After all that, 2 hours later, I was throwing up my steak, something was really bad with that food. You definitely must have better places to go in Santa Barbara.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Went here on a whim. The place looks like they converted an old funeral home into a lounge style restaurant. We had no reservation so were seating in the lounge even the place looked empty. My main gripe is that the food is not worth the price tag. They are trying to serve center city trendy food at the prices you would expect in the art district downtown. Well it is not worth it. Much like a Starr place you are paying more for atmosphere here than quality. I mean their dessert are bought frozen. I know this because we ordered one and it was given to us still frozen. We alerted the waitress and she replaced it explaining that there were two and she grabbed the still frozen one. Classy.

"Memories.  i still remember the first time of many I was here.  Where else can you grab a late, late night meal after a night of drinking.  I was in the drive thru with my rear seat filled with nearly passed out drunks.  The caravan of cars was long; couldn't go forward, backward or escape the drive through.  Luckily, there was an construction outhouse 100 feet away in view.  We were able to empty out my car, with me included and one-by-one use this outhouse and still make it to car before the line moved.  Big burrito can do wonders for sobering up.  I can't explain the attendant who smelled of cannabis, but the food.. got to us.. albeit slowly.  3 stars would be my experience if it weren't for slow service that is consistently slow.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I didn't hate the tacos. A few time the orders have been messed up. The carne Asada was a little tough but the carnitas and chicken were cool. I really like the guacamole and spicy salsa.

"I think this place has really gone downhill. I used to eat there somewhat frequently because of a general lack of ethnic dining options in the area, and it was always pretty good. Apparently there are new owners and, in my opinion, the food has suffered because of it. The flavors are much more generic and bland, almost like the Thai version of Chinese restaurants that use ""Chef's special brown sauce"" for 40 different dishes.   If you'd like something Asian that's a little more exotic than Chinese in Ballwin, I'd go down the street to Monsoon Vietnamese Bistro, they're usually pretty good.  Edit: Oh, and regarding Rachel's comment about the peppers, the way it works is that 1 pepper is sort of like the default level of hotness. Then, if you want it hotter, rather than the waitress trying to interpret what you mean by ""Extra hot,"" you say ""3"" or ""4"" or whatever level you think you can tolerate.  Related to this, and as a fan of extra hot food, I wouldn't recommend going much over 2 on most dishes because they do make it nice and hot, but as I noted in my review, the flavors aren't that strong to begin with and it's easy to overpower them with the heat. At that point you might as well be eating hot green chiles dipped in fish sauce, that's what the experience will be like.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The decor is great. The shakes are delicious. The music is fun. Having said that, this place is crowded and the placement of tables doesn't help. Our food was all passable, but everyone's fries were ice cold. My tater tots were hot , but I think the rest of our table suffered while waiting for those. We ordered a bowl of fruit we never did receive and, when we asked for a fancy shake, the girl making the shakes actually came out to try and sell us on a simpler one because she was the only person making the deserts and the large shakes take too long. Our server forgot everything from refills, to bussing the table to that fruit bowl. We won't go here again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Large menu and options, but I thought I should definitely try pancakes and ended up with the Austrian apple walnut pancakes. The taste was ok, but it was smothered in apple cider compote, and whipped cream, so much so that it was dripping off my plate. Not a very appealing appearance. The coffee was also not very good. Maybe it was just my pick but it wasn't very impressive-definitely not for all the hype we had heard or for waiting in such a long line.

The chicken chow mein (picture included) was so greasy. It's like they covered it in oil- absolutely disgusting. I've had the same dish from another Smilies location and it was good so not sure how they manage to mess up such a simple dish.

"La Chancla is a traditional Taquería that specializes in tortas (sandwiches). I really want to like this place. I can walk to it from my place.

I've gone through all the standards (tacos, burritos, enchiladas, quesadilla) and it's all bland to me. Admittedly, I haven't had a tortas because I'm not truly a sandwich guy, but I'd expect you to hit the staples right first. There's a million Mexican places in Norristown.

"Visiting in the area and wanted carry-out fish tacos so compared menus from a couple of restaurants. Liked the sound of the Mahi Mahi street tacos here because they came with a crunchy slaw and you could get corn tortillas. (The other place served theirs with lettuce, cheese, and flour tortillas). Here, you can also request cilantro and onion as sides. However, when I returned home with my order, I was very disappointed to see that my tacos did not have the slaw (only onion and cilantro), small pieces of fish, and were on large flour tortillas. The taste was okay but the minimal filling was overpowered by flour tortilla. Given that I filled the order out online (which prompts you to specify exactly what you want), my expectations were high that I'd get what was ordered. (Btw, my daughter ordered pork tacos on flour tortillas, and hers came on corn tortillas.) My suggestion to others is to check your to-go order before leaving the restaurant!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"We went on a Sunday night. It took ages to get our food and it was fine. Nothing special I'd return for. It was too busy for any customer service to speak of, and after waiting forever for the sushi, we had to wait just as long for the check. Too busy for refills or to check on guests even once. A glass of wine would've helped the wait but sadly I didn't have that option as the server never came back to our table. There were a lot of other frustrated diners there like us- hire another server please!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Went here on a Friday night, 8:30 reservation for 3. The restaurant design and atmosphere is basically the only positive thing to say about CO-OP. The bathrooms, huge lounge area in the next room, and seating area are all really nice looking.  Unfortunately the service was terrible. It took about 20 minutes to get our first drink and they did not have the Kombucha cocktail (though they still charged us for it on the bill). After sitting around for about a half hour the waiter (who was probably new) took our order. We got the Brussels sprouts and the calamari for apps. The ""Crispy"" Brussels were not cooked and nearly raw, the sauce was decent. The calamari isn't anything special.  For entrees the 3 of us got the Wild Striped Bass, Scallops, and Cauliflower Dukkah. The Cauliflower was definitely the best of the 3, it was hot (comes in a cast iron dish) and tasty enough, though again a bit undercooked. The Bass that I had came out barely warm - it comes on a bed of wild rice and ""roasted seasonal vegetables"". The vegetables were literally raw - the carrots and I believe parsnips were barely cooked, and the broccoli was more cooked but not very good. Very disappointing, and raw parsnips left a bitter taste in your mouth. The bass itself was ok, it had crispy skin but again it wasn't warm enough so it wasn't very appetizing to eat. The scallops came out cold, on a bed of spaghetti squash something or other, and the whole dish was cold. My girlfriend is much more vocal than I and she complained and they sent it back to be ""warmed up"" not remade...so yeah it came out again like 3 minutes later and it was lukewarm. She ate it basically because we wanted to get out of there.  When the bill came it was over $200 and like I said they charged us for the kombucha drinks which we didn't get, so we took the bill to a manager. Really the only other positive thing was the way they handled it. They reduced our bill by about 50%, took off those drinks we didn't get and brought us out a slice of cheesecake and chocolate cake, which unfortunately weren't good, but it was a nice gesture. Thanks to the manager for trying to make things right. Won't be going back for food but may go back to check out the lounge some other time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Service was friendly and quite good, which is the minimum you would expect from an over priced steak house. Once in a while the waitress would come by with the table cumber (the metal crumb scraper thingy) to clean the table a bit. That's always a nice touch. The menu was decent in terms of selection. I eat out a lot (way more than I'd like or more than I probably should) and I'm no cheapskate. Still, even for me $40+ for just a mediocre steak is a little hard to swallow (figuratively and literally).  And that's just for a plate with a cooked meat of some kind on it. Sides? Those are extra. If the mean was phenomenal, then I wouldn't bat an eye...  We all decide to go with the combo meals (AKA pre fixe menu) rather than order everything a-la-carte.  We sent back the bisque because it was way to salty. The steaks came out OK, but they were not really rubbed or seasoned from what I could tell. At the risk of sounding immodest, I prepare a much better steak on the grill at home. A nice rub, some simple salt and pepper, after cooking let sit a few minutes with little bit of butter melted on top. Anyway, I ordered the salmon. It was cooked perfectly and tasted very good. I tasked the steak and it was just, meh.  Also, the inside could use a really good cleaning. The floor coming/going from the kitchen area into the main dining hall is well worn and grimy looking. It's not super well lighted (like most fancy steak houses) so I did not really check out the rest of the place for wear and tear.  I don't know - maybe it's must me - but if I'm dropping a couple hundred dollars on dinner, I expect a little more attention to detail and better food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The best way I could describe this place is a little coarse or crass. From their choice of miso paste which was very coarse instead of the usual smooth paste to the almost crunchy quality of their wasabi, very course and crispy and devoid of taste or heat. I enjoy the upgrade of the space and the youthfulness of the staff, but I feel these changes have lead to a distinct loss of refinement one usually expects at a sushi restaurant. The waiter was a bit crass, I was taken aback by his stance and conversation style he didn't really want to explain too much. Even with his handling of other customers, he wasn't backing down on his correct naming of dishes, the table near us tried to order Unagidon or eel and rice bowl and he kept correcting them, ""you mean Chirashi don"" which sadly was incorrect. I ordered the Omakase to get a feel of the chef and menu, and as each plate came out there was no description, no explanation. I would have welcomed some sort of explanation at least so that I could order the same dish again if I came back, but I may not. The menu looks playful and so too do the platings but they lack substance to shoulder their beauty. I'd love photographing this food, but I'd rather hit up the sushi bar up the street. It's the youthful invigoration I feel that takes the taste a little lightly, even the soy sauce at the table lacks body and taste. I'm happy to have tried the place so I can mark it off as a place I can avoid.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

It was mine, to say the least. She kept telling me that if i was lying she was going to kick me out. That is no way to treat a customer.   The service is horrendous. The servers are NEVER happy and don't even come over to check up on us to see if our food is good. It took forever for us to even get our food. We had about 3 different servers with taking our order, giving us our food, and giving us the check. None of which were happy or friendly.

"My husband and I dined at la casa Della pasta tonight with a Groupon coupon.  The Groupon site states that an automatic tip of 18% would be added to the total bill before any discounts are taken.  This seems a bit high anyway and certainly considering the poor service.  Anyway when the bill came it included a charge for a bottle of wine when we had only one glass of wine.  We informed the server who returned with a corrected check.  What we did notice was that the first Check had a tip of $20 included (much higher than 18% of that check total I  might add). The tip was not adjusted down on the ""corrected"" check making it much even greater than  18%!!!  The check was $51 and change. My husband  gave the server $52 and she did not bring back his change.  He was owed less than a dollar, true, however when they gave themselves a huge automatic tip it didn't seem very ethical to us.  The manager or owner was not friendly either.  The food was okay. I ordered a ceasar salad. The romaine was not fresh and it was discolored. I had the risotto with mushrooms. This was not particularly good.  It was average and I am almost certain they used canned mushrooms which don't have a lot of flavor.  My husband enjoyed his ravioli with lobster however.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
So we had gotten gift cards and were looking forward to going since there are 6 in our family we don't always try something new but we thought since it is New Year's Day we wanted to celebrate.  They sat us in a table maybe meant for 5 even though there was enough room to sit us where we each had a spot at the table.  The refill of chips was great.  We went through 3 baskets before our food.   Food came but we had to wait for napkins and utensils and then the tortillas.  I thought since I had fajitas it should have come relatively close together so my food wouldn't be cold.  I tasted my fajitas and the first bite was I thought a little burnt.  I have always ordered fajitas when I go somewhere new because I never thought you could mess up a fajita.   I asked the server why the steak was so thin.  He said it was because it was carne asada.   I have never had a fajita with meat so thin.  It wasn't brought out sizzling so don't expect that.  It was in a bowl that had all the grease so don't expect it to be healthier for you.  I didn't want it but in other restaurants they try to fix it or offer something else.  I don't normally complain but it was 17 dollars of something I didn't like. My husband thought his carnitas were dry.  I gave it 2 stars because 2 people in the group were happy with their food. Before food came I went to the bathroom.   There was paper towels all over the floor because the garbage was full and little papers everywhere.  I let them know.  My daughter went sometime later and it was the same.  My husband said it was probably because it was the end of the night.  We did come in at 7:30.  I feel though if a customer brings something like taking out the overflowing trash you should just do it no matter the time especially since there was nowhere to put used towels.   At the end we were given the bill and were not asked if we wanted dessert.   I was a little bummed because I wanted dessert since we never really do this and we had some money left on the gift card.   We waited for the server to ask.  Finally we left the gift cards and tip because got tired of waiting.  My husband noticed the other server checked our bill to make sure we paid.  Wished the customer service was better.  Service was ok but not customer service.  My kids convinced me that we would not have liked the dessert anyway.   I didn't mind leaving the small amount on gift card as I will not be coming back here and will talk to Costco about not doing gift cards there.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I hate to leave a bad review here because this place has good quality food, but they seem to get my order wrong 70-80% of the time. I've been using the online ordering function found on their website for many months now. I don't know if it's a problem with the website or if the issue is occurring at the store, but this has happened way too many times for me not to say something about it. For example, if I check the box online that says ""No Cream Cheese"" they still give me cream cheese. If I check the box that says ""Extra Sprouts"" they won't give me any sprouts at all. When they get it right, the food is great, but that doesn't seem to be happening often enough for me to continue going there. Shame on me for giving it so many chances I guess.

The fish in each roll was cut up in more of a tartare style before being rolled which I wasn't really impressed with. The taste of each was similar, and I have to wonder if I got 2 different rolls or 2 of the same. No veggies in either roll.   The staff was friendly, and I didn't have to wait long.

When we walked in we got that same feeling of charm.   The menu is very limited, but it's pizza, we're not picky. We got a small, thin crust veggie pizza. It was $14 with tax, so not a bad deal! But I just kept thinking about how I could get the same size custom pizza at Pizza Rev for $8!   The boy working the register was honestly the worst. I asked how the cheesy garlic bread was and at first he just stared at me and then he said ""it's alright."" And then I asked what customers say about it. He said ""some of them like it, some of them don't. I think it's good."" He had no personality and really couldn't answer a simple question. He also seemed so confused when we asked for cups for water. Just a very slow employee with no opinion.   After we got a table we seriously had to wait a good 20 minutes for our pizza. There weren't even that many people in the restaurant. I know they had deliveries but REALLY.   The pizza itself was actually good but the crust wasn't THAT thin. It was fine for me but I know a lot of people order thin crust to eat healthier and I would have been upset if that would have been the case for me. There was also so much cheese on the pizza.

He even placed two cups of soup at our table, right after we sat down mistakenly, at first acting like it was something we ordered, then he hesitated on picking them back up, probably realizing it looked bad and he decided not to bring them to their correct table. We had complimentary turtle soup and gumbo - both were good, so thanks.  Very disappointing overall. We might consider on going back, just to sit in the beautiful courtyard for a cocktail but we will wait until Tourism picks back up and things are operating fully. Maybe service and food will get better.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This restaurant needs to focus less on having an army to serve you, and more on presentation and flavor of the food.   We started with the Ahi, which was dry and lacked flavor; my salmon tasted burned and appeared to be swimming...in sauces. It was hardly edible without the sauces, and even those required a hearty squeeze of lemon juice to be appealing. My husband's duck, while cooked well, was fishy and unappetizing.   On the topic of service, I find it highly obnoxious to be assaulted for my drink order before receiving a wine or cocktail list, especially when the young lady requesting the order seemed so put off by my request for a wine list. I felt as if we should have known what wines were available simply by setting foot in the restaurant, and it definitely set the tone for the rest of our meal. Otherwise, service was impeccable to the point of being overkill.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I'm so irritated and conflicted. The wings are amazing and the managers are always accommodating when my order is wrong (which has only been a couple times in the many years I've been eating there), but I have had it with the rude attitude of the girl at the cashier counter. I don't know her name, but she is by far the worst part about the Wing Co experience for me. Went there for lunch today and I almost turned around and walked out when I saw she was working but I really wanted wings. I somehow always get stuck with her and it's the same bulls*** every time. Rolling her eyes, barely speaking up enough for me to hear her, look on her face like I'm ruining her day, rushing me through my order, and not willing to help me or my friends with recommendations or questions about a menu item. There have been times when I came up to the counter just to ask a question and she blatantly ignores me. I can't stand it.

"I was once told my an employee of TD to NEVER eat here.  With that being said, I can disclose that I wish I could eat the mini hamburgers here everyday. For many unnamed reasons, I'm sure I should not - but they're just that good. Not to mention, they are the closest thing you will get to a Krystal burger unless you want to go to Bourbon Street and spend an obscene amount of money on a tiny burger that shouldn't be priced at more than 50 cents. (I'm not driving to Lafayette for Krystal burger, would you?)   Their desserts, while still good, have gone downhill over the years. You can purchase better desserts at Robert's, SAMs, Costco, or one of our amazing local bakeries if you feel like spending a little dough (pun-intended).  I used to love their doughnuts, and I haven't found any other doughnuts quite like theirs. You should know that they're the thick kind, though. There's nothing wrong with that; people just seem to prefer the right off the conveyer belt, lighter-tasting doughnuts these days.  The employees aren't the friendliest in town, but it's clear they don't have to be. This tastee has existed on this corner for as long as I can remember. My neighbors - past and present - have kept this place a staple in their lives. If you're around and need a quick, well-priced breakfast (not just donuts and pastries), give it a shot. You may just love their stuff.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"DO NOT GIVE THIS RESTAURANT YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION OVER THE PHONE!!! IF YOU HAVE RECENTLY ORDERED TAKEOUT OVER THE PHONE FROM THIS RESTAURANT, PLEASE CHECK YOUR RECENT CHARGES!  My wife and I love this place. The fried chicken is great. However, my wife recently noticed that there were fraudulent charges on her card and the fraudulent charges were for other restaurants in Philadelphia ordered through Grub Hub, which we do not use. Looking at her statement we noticed that we had used her card to order ChiMc King over the phone right before that. This restaurant takes credit card information over the phone for pick up orders and we suspect that someone from ChiMc King is stealing people's credit card information!  I am writing this review so that the owner sees this and investigates what is happening at his restaurant.

Appetizers are half off and like their entrees, portions are huge. My wife really enjoys the patio and often asks to go there since she now craves crab cakes since trying them at Kemolls.  Food and service are still incredible and unlike any other place I've been too! In the past, we would go to Kemolls about once or twice a year, because we didn't want to go downtown just for dinner.

"All I can say is ""NOOOOOOOOO!"" I had such high hopes for this place. It's in one of the most notorious areas of Missouri, surrounded by all wonderful places.   My girlfriend and I came here around 1AM on Thursday, I will star off by saying that this place has the SLOWEST service ever! There were literally 4 other people in the restaurant. We waited over 25 minutes for us to be asked what drinks we wanted, then an additional 15 minutes for what we wanted to order. It took almost an hour for our food to come out even though there was barely anyone eating in here. The food was not good at all. It seems like everything we ordered was either pre-made  and just heated up in a microwave or frozen and thawed. We ended up leaving this place past 3AM!!!

"Cute little market in downtown Dunedin. It's kind of like a mini Whole Foods or Fresh market. It offers a small variety of natural/organic/non-gmo foods. My husband and I had a coupon for $5 off of $30, and we were able to spend that easily. The items here seem a bit overpriced to me.   I'm pretty content with my purchase though, because I got a Dr. Bronner's soap. It was the first time I ever purchased the soap, and I'm loving it!  They were lacking a couple items I thought they'd have, so that was disappointing. Out of the many varieties of kombucha, they didn't carry the Humm brand. That's one of the only brands I enjoy. And they didn't have much selection of the Beyond Meat products, which was also a bit surprising to me just based on the vibe of the store.  The market has a pretty decent section where you can order prepared foods, and sit and eat them. They also have a couple tables outside, so maybe I should've ordered breakfast or lunch and had a more gratifying experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"You know what?  Binkley's is an awesome spot.  As anyone who reads my reviews can tell you, I can be harshly critical; but, I can't find much wrong with Binkley's.  Usually, in reviews, I leave the worst for last, but this time, I'm just going to criticize first.  Binkley's has a large parking lot for the area of town in which it sits; however, the lot clearly isn't big enough.  I practically parked in someone's yard during my last dining experience.  However, a crowded parking lot says a lot about a restaurant.  When is the last time you had trouble parking at Applebee's?  Now that the ""bad"" is out of the way, it's time for the good stuff.  Binkley's is full of the good stuff.  It is a warm, homey establishment, especially in the winter.  It has the feel of a down-home neighborhood eatery, but with a bit more class and panache.  The staff is always extra-special friendly, and they cater to the customer's every want and need.  More than being friendly and delivering great service, they treat the diner, well, as a homey establishment should: almost like family.  If I ate there on a more regular basis, I'm confident that they would remember my first and last name--at the very least.    The Americana-style menu at Binkley's is large and impressive--as are the portion sizes. Whether you are looking for a burger, cold sandwich, pasta, soup, or salad, they serve it. I am particularly fond of their burgers, especially since bison meat can be substituted for beef at a nominal charge.  I've likewise been very satisfied with pasta dishes and salads that I have ordered in the past.  Binkley's also has a full bar, and has a wide selection of beer, wines, and spirits.  The bar always carries locally brewed beer, and the service staff is quick to boast about the wide array.  With their large menu of appetizers, Binkley's is a great place to watch a game, or to have a pint with your mates.  The prices at Binkley's are very reasonable, especially considering the quality of food that is served.  While they do offer some more expensive entrees (like steaks and salmon), they do not vastly exceed the $20.00 range.  However, it is entirely possible to have a meal that is equal in price to one that you would have at an inferior restaurant--like Applebee's or T.G.I. Friday's.  You'll never remember a meal at a lousy chain restaurant, but you're not likely to forget the one you had a Binkley's.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I've had the drum at almost every NOLA restaurant I've been to and this was the worst.  It could have been good (i.e., nice preparation), but overcooked fish (it was almost tough to chew) just doesn't work for me.  And it wasn't just me.

"My husband likes hamburgers. I like gourmet restaurants. Zinburger to the rescue!   The place was clean, and the decor was super funky and updated. I loved the outfits on the wait staff...Chuck Taylors!   We were greeted quickly at the door and sat at a hightop table near the bar. The waitress was super friendly and helpful in explaining the menu.   The burgers were anywhere from $9 for a basic to $15 for Kobe. This wouldn't be so bad, but the fries/sides were all priced separately. Again...which wouldn't have been SO bad, if the only options for sides served two. I wanted the zucchini fries ($5), and my husband wanted regular. ($6). It seemed kinda silly to get both for just the two of us. Especially given how much the burgers were. So, we just ordered the regular fries to split.   I liked the variety of different combinations on the toppings, but was disappointed to find that none of the options included blue cheese. I ended up doing a la cart with $9 for the base burger, and added mushrooms & goat cheese. I was disappointed that for $1.25 per topping, I only got like 4 pieces of mushroom.   The flavor was pretty great. I enjoyed it. I ordered it medium, which I typically do. The fries weren't anything special, but they were pretty good. My husband enjoyed his too.   The worst part of the experience was the end of the meal when it took us forever to get our check. In my experience this is where most wait staff really drop the ball. It's like they forget about you because they're done serving the meal. I ended up going up to the bar and getting the check from the manager. Disappointing.   It wasn't a bad lunch experience.

"I used to go here often.  But haven't made it back in a while. Looking over the Yelp reviews, it seems like it has gone downhill.  But for my birthday I received a gift card so I thought I should check it out again.  I was surprised that the parking lot was so empty.  I was able to pack on the first row, never a good sign.  I was seated promptly and the waiter showed up, was friendly, and took my order.  I was wanted so BBQ chicken for a while, so that's what I ordered the rotisserie chicken.  The food came out pretty quick, but it was not delivered by my waiter.  Could be a good / bad sign.  They dropped it off and quickly disappeared before I could ask for some BBQ sauce.  So I continued to wait to flag someone and finished up my salad.  After about 5 minutes, I flagged my server down and requested the sauce.  He was obviously unhappy.  About 10 minutes later with my good going cold, I walked up to the prep station (manager was there) and asked for it.  He apologized.  About 10 minutes later, the waiter came by, attempting to apologize I guess, and said ""My manager said you were unhappy about having to wait."".  That was my apology.  I want to think that this was a one-off experience, but reading the other reviews it seems systemic.  They used to be stellar.

"The oceans are empty and I am full, result of a successful sushi trip.  Continuing the less than original naming tend to name a sushi place after the street it is located on is Sushi Cortarro.  Walk in and you will see a few semicircular booths backing on to the window for dates,  then many tables that can be moved to accommodate even large groups, a bar and of course a sushi bar.  Sit down and the great service begins, your drink order is taken and delivered in seconds. There were 4 or 5 servers for this store front sized location.  The Sushi menu has all of the usual favorites and some unique specials. There is a orange menu for a $20 All you can eat deal. The all you can heat has a few limitations, no more than 5 rolls per round per person, and if you have left overs you are charged an additional $5. There are some apps on the all you can eat, nigiri, rolls and some specialty rolls. The quality of fish was quite good as was the craftsmanship of the rolls.   I was quite pleased when my ship of sushi arrived, boats are just fun! I really liked the large amounts of avocado in the rolls.  Another great thing about this establishment is the picture menu's.

They feel like family.    But I cannot say that I enjoyed my food all that much...I feel so bad saying it, but I just didn't.  I got the mussels as appetizers - they were good and all, but was not impressed.  The sauce was the best part.  You get about a pound for the order.  I then had the pork chops for dinner - this was totally unimpressive.  The pork chop was quite flavorless, and a bit overcooked.  The piece was small, I'd say less than 8oz, including the bone.  And finally, the risotto that it came with was bland and watery (causing the pork chop to be doused in that liquid).    My friend's ravioli with meat sauce was pretty good, but you'll only get about 6 -8 raviolis.  My other friend's tilapia was totally uneventful.

I discovered Jimmy's thanks to a Philadelphia Magazine article four or five years ago and have been going there pretty regularly (2 or 3 times a year) since then. I've NEVER been disappointed and have come to the conclusion that it is the best BBQ anywhere in Suburban Philadelphia. Never had a bad meal there and everything is simply incredible. Can't recommend it highly enough.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Inviting atmosphere,  dim lighting,  good for a variety of meals (family,  date night,  girls night etc).   The waitress was attentive and shared a variety of specials. Drinks were prompt. Menu offered a good selection of different foods.    We ordered the crab cake app, which was visually appealing.  It wasn't bad,  but it wasn't to my liking due to liking the east coast preparation of crab cakes. Didn't care for the bread on the table either. It was not so great.    The entrées win good feedback. My dad ordered the pork special, and I ordered the petite filets. Both were great. My steak was cooked perfectly medium rare as I asked.

"I've only been here once, but am excited for the new addition to Irvington! Was here on a Thursday about 7 and they had a few tables available. They have some tables of 4 ( as well as a bar) and a few other types of tables, and we were sat with another couple. We had the pain killer drinks (good, but not cheap), the shiitake mushrooms with were sliced and fried with a light batter (maybe tempura?) and served with 2 sauces. Those were absolutely amazing. I can't believe they were only mushrooms! Honestly! We also had the poke fries, which were solid, but not as good as the mushrooms. I also enjoyed the atmosphere. Cons? Servers seemed really busy, would have had another drink if id have been asked earlier. Also, the hallway in the  back was crazy dark. My friend had to use the flashlight on his phone to find the bathroom ( the people at our table had to as well!), not sure if that was the norm or the light got burned out. Lastly, I asked about their hours and was told 5-12. Forgot to ask if they were open 7 days a week! But we will definitely be back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
Came here because I knew the horchata is really good but the food doesn't live up to the drinks here.  The watermelon agua fresca was one of the best I've had.  The best things here were the #16 especial the homemade torillas.  The peppers and the cheese in the #16 give it that extra layer of flavor which I loved.  Not bad: Sopas de Pollo Guac  Would Skip: adobada tacos: they were dry and had absolutely no flavor rajas tacos: its just cheese with green peppers and onions  For being a small taco shop this place isn't cheap but that didn't stop the massive lines which they constantly had.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Unfortunately the reviews & hype are ALL LIES. Spending your money here for the experience is a design in idiocy; expecting superiority in all aspects is a fantasy. First the one star for the reservation being honored. We were seated at 1pm.  Second star only got the waitress. She was honest but severely overwhelmed. This owner is greedy & a grifter. The waitress told us that there were THREE PEOPLE IN THE KITCHEN TODAY. Unreal that a place with so many patrons operate as such & have the audacity to continue operating at full capacity. Most people will understand why Black people do not support Black businesses when patronizing Willie B's. They make you wanna just quit supporting altogether.   After we were seated our waitress, the beautiful dear, told us: the food wait will be bad, she was HONEST. True to her word, we were seated at 1p, ordered at 115p, & didn't eat our appetizer until 230p. Drinks were a hit. I tried to tip her prepay and did. We still only saw her every 30 mins at our table. She was everywhere!  So for two lushes like us, one drink an hour is below subpar AGAIN OUR WAITRESS WAS ERRTHANG. Overall save your coins. For the prices not worth the hype. For the LACKING IN ORGANIZATION & experience NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. ALL tables around us were cussing & complaining from minute one. But hookah was overflowing.   Unreal, overhyped, & shotty as hell.

We also ordered a truffle pizza, which would have been great if the crust hadn't been burnt (and I'm a HUGE fan of the thin, crispy crust- just not the one with blackened edges) and if there had been any truffle on it.

"I have lived outside NYC for 15 years of my life. My husband was born and raised there. We know NYC pizza. I also know Ohio pizza. This was more Ohio pizza than it was NYC pizza.   Went to this place after a 6PM comedy show. It was us and a few other tables, so not full. There were 6 of us.   It was recommended to us from someone in our group. We went in thinking we were going to get the special they offer on the website, with 2 slices, a soda and a garlic knot each. The other folks looked at the specials then decided to get pies.   I asked the waitress about the special but she tried over and over again to get us to order a pie. Then I saw her talking to the owner and she came over and tried to offer us a deal in splitting up a huge pie between the table evenly in the bills. But we all wanted different toppings, so it wasn't going to work.   No one was really impressed with what we did receive. The garlic knots were hard inside. The pizza wasn't great. Good cheese can be told by the amount of oil coming off the top of the pizza. If the cheese is melted and there is oil dripping down your fingers, you have good cheese. If you have no oils, and the cheese is clumpy, it's crap. This wasn't crap, but there wasn't oil leaking off either.   Both of my slices hardened almost immediately which means that cheese was old. My toppings were flavorless. The husband wasn't impressed, and he's the one who will eat most ""NYC"" style pizzas without a lot of complaints. But the major problem was that this crust wasn't NYC style.   For those of you who don't know, NYC style pizza has to be folded in order to eat it because the crust is so thin. I wish I had remembered to take a photo, because this pizza held itself up with any issue. No folding required.   If you want REAL NYC style pizza - go to Eddie and Sam's in Tampa. You can hardly get into the place at mealtime, sometimes you even have to stand. But they have really good NYC style pizza! They have great toppings, mild sauce, oily cheese and crust you have to fold! Trust me on this. It's the closest we've found, and the only thing that keeps my hubby happy here in our current home.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Was THAT what all the fuss was about? Did I eat at a different place as the rest of the people reviewing this place? I saw NOTHING special about my SEVERELY over-priced, anorexic sandwich. The best thing about the cheesesteak was the bread. The sandwiches are literally just a few slivers of meat on a big bun. And for that, you will pay over $9. Want fries and a drink? You're looking at almost $20 for your lunch....AND, you have to go to 2 separate windows to order it all. For 2/3 of that price, you can get a meal with fries and a drink, or at least a sandwich with so much meat that you need an extra bun to eat it all. My food shouldn't be on a diet, and that is why I will NOT be making a return trip to Steves. Not recommended.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Wow Chick-A-Bombed. One of the worst chicken sandwiches I've had. Came across this place on Instagram and saw that they claimed ""best sandwich in America"". They need to take a visit to California or anywhere else there's chicken sandwiches and try those before they claim that.  I'll start off by saying it was pretty dry in there, completely dark all around, no music playing, looked like a graveyard in there. I saw they used to have yellow walls and that was a lot better before atleast a lot more vibrant.   When it comes to the sandwich itself, it was a mess. Way to much sauce, with the combination of the bbq and boom sauce. It would be better if they coated the chicken instead of shooting the sauce on. When it comes to the chicken itself. Unfortunately it was pre cooked. The chicken was tense, and I can tell by the Instagram videos that the chicken is cooked in big batches.  Also with only 3 fryers there's no way its cooked freshed. The fries were whatever as well, majority of the pictures on Instagram they are waffle fries. I got more of a Arby's style fry wasn't much seasoning on it.  Strawberry lemonade was good though, but they are premade.  Overall pretty dissapointing and for the price wasnt worth it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Perhaps my expectations was too high after reading and seeing the photos on Yelp. I was thinking this is a special occasion place since we couldn't get reservation on our last visit last year so we make a point to try this place on our last trip to Santa Barbara last weekend  I was debating between here and the Sushi bar at Montecito Inn since I wanted an upscale and special experience and decided to go here to check off my list. Let just say I was disappointed when I entered since the restaurant wasn't even half full literally there were 9 people eating the entire evening all were in the 4 booths and the rest of the tables on the other 2/3 of the restaurant was empty.  You know what they say about empty restaurant on a Friday night right, mean food won't be as fresh since not enough people to consume what they sell.  They could dim the light perhaps to make it a bit warmer it just feel empty and cold. Even with the effort of a small tea light candle on the table Anyway so the ambiance was a bust but we were there to eat food so it was fine. Next came the menu price somewhere on the site I saw $85 for 7 courses but when we showed up it was $125, if I would have known I would have for sure chosen the 17 courses for $125 at the sushi bar at Montecito.  So oh well right, it's $40 difference which is fine if the food was outstanding. There were 2 waitresses they were polite, prompt but for sure at time they look bored.  Again may be my expectations is higher for the caliber and price of food. Came the food, beef tasted old and over cooked everything else was either bland or sweet not balanced  Fish and sashimi were good, they were fresh but they tasted average fresh sushi, I don't have complaints but not wow. Everything else again was sweet or ok again nothing to rave home about.  The only one thing I like out of the entire meal was the Uni but for $12.95 a box at Santa Barbara fish market I can get the exact same Uni though so for that reason I don't think the ambiance and price worth the experience I was expecting. Nice presentation of food but something is missing for sure so don't let those photos trick you, if you are looking for a special and wholesome experience this will not be the place.

Let it be known that the tacos are quite basic but they have Kid Cudi top hit song names for example day and night the pursuit of happiness the commander.   NO where on this Tuesday special menu did THE MENU mention a trio would be three of the same damn tacos.  I mean with 6 options I surely would like to mix and match.

"I have been a regular at Mugshots for a while now but have been frequenting this joint more recently with my inability to focus on school work at home.  One would think that a noisy coffee shop would be counterproductive, but MugShots is relatively quiet during the day with a very laid back feel and free wifi, and the coffee is strong enough to keep me awake.  What I don't particularly care for is the price of their food.  For $8.50 I feel as though I should be getting more than a soup bowl sized serving of salad.  Don't get me wrong--it is absolutely delicious and I order it every time I walk in there (I'm a major sucker for the Alcatraz salad.  That dressing is to-die-for).  But it is a little bit outlandish price wise.   I also used to love their Curry chicken salad wrap, but as of this week it is no longer on the menu.

"There are holes in the wall, and then there are... walls. Just four thick concrete walls, little windows, an oasis of hot food in a sea of industrial wasteland. Gas stations, tractor-trailers, vagrants... and delicious BBQ. Sure, why not drive 2 hours each way? In fact, I drove 2 hours to try new ""exotic"" meats (muskrat and raccoon), only to find out that you have to order ahead for those, because they trap in limited numbers and reservations quickly tap out those supplies. So I ordered ahead, drove home, and prepared to return ANOTHER 2 hours each way, just for those meats. And here I am leaving a 4 star review. I have to put this out there: This place knows how to BBQ. Period. The raccoon was one of the top BBQs I've ever had, up there with mutton in Kentucky, pork in Georgia, beef in Texas, and ribs in KC. It was fall off the bone tender, full of flavor, perfectly sauced, very dark meat. Huge portion for a reasonable price - an entire haunch plus. The muskrat was slightly breaded I think, which made it extremely messy (-1 star). The sauce was tangier, still the right proportion. The meat was harder to find among the bones of this small mammal, but that's not Sunset's fault. My one friend who's ever tried muskrat said she found it uselessly chewy. Here, it had the consistency of broiled chicken. Again, this place knows how to BBQ. Now, the first time I came down, I decided to still get dinner anyway, and the woman (it's a husband-wife team) recommended the pork chop. I should have had the pulled pork. The pork chop was breaded, but had been sitting out for a little while and so the breading was soggy and the chop was chewy. Not something I'd recommend, but it's not BBQ. This place doesn't have ""fried"" in its name. Just saying. Sides are hit or miss. Let me guide you. Collard greens: OK. A little vinegary but not overly imbalanced. Black eyed peas were good but basically just peas with a bit of salt/seasoning. They were far better as rice&beans when you can mix it with that flavorful yellow rice. Potato salad, not really my thing. Too much mayo sauce - maybe some mustard making it yellow? - but not really my flavor/consistency. Mac&cheese was bleeeh. Lima beans (really broad beans, I think) were amazing. That is a dish I would get every time. Will get every time. I'm coming back every year for some raccoon.

We came in on Memorial Day to a dead restaurant, which was surprising.   Our service was exceptional, but the food was forgettable and overpriced. I ordered the spaghetti and house-made meatballs and the better half got some rigatoni dish with a cream sauce and chicken. The fresh bread that used to be good absolutely sucked, and the calamari was whatever. Had it not been for the gift card I'd have had no reason to come in, and I certainly have no reason to come back. Butternut squash ravioli for $21?! That's hilarious.

"I had high hopes for this place after several locals told us it was a good joint. I wouldn't say I am a sushi snob, but I can definitely tell the difference between a quality place and one that just throws rolls together. I called ahead to place an order of 5 rolls. The first disappointment was presentation. None of the rolls had any sauce drizzled on top, or any thing making them stand out. The second disappointment was size. The rice covering the outside of the sushi wrap was so thin, that it barely covered the sushi wrap itself. I also ordered a bowl of miso soup which in total had two, tiny pieces of seaweed and one tofu cube. I definitely got the impression that this place was either too busy to care about quality and presentation or they are trying to cut corners.  This is a place I wouldn't return to. I felt that the price of the rolls does not justify the quality or size. We will continue to go to our ""usual"" sushi place from now on.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

First, the omelette was EGGS when I twice stated that it HAS to be egg whites because of a yolk allergy. The nice gal confirmed this earlier so the kitchen screwed up.

It was so delicious and succulent, I wanted to go back there for more. As an English person, you don't quite get the popularity of fast food in the US, primarily because the standards of such fare aren't particularly high here. But sometimes in the States, even though it's mass-produced, it still tastes so good.

I work in the food industry so I know how to treat people, these people don't care about anything, and just assume you're a stupid tourist, order and PAID for to go food, I went to get it and got re directed to 3 different people (all had awful attitudes) then finally I get acknowledged at the bar and am told with the most snide and awful attitude by and older lady ""I have no idea what you're talking about"" after I had been patient and asked nicely for my food ($80 worth), I was like ok well the app told me it was done and I paid so... and she just looked at me with raised eyebrows so I had to walk away, even if I had somehow gotten confused with the app or something I wasn't offered any help or any "" hey let me help you figure it out"" like I would have done if it were one of my guests.

"I feel like this may be my FIRST harsh review, so bear with me.  My current thought is why did I just spend hard earned money on that? I'm looking for some gum so I don't smell like bad fish! That was by far THE worst food I've ever had. The quality of the fish was terrible. The options are slim, there are like 10 lunch rolls and 10 dinner rolls.  Not all the appetizers are on ""AYCE."" Not even my beloved mochi were AYCE, like most places.   I hate when places charge you extra for something you don't like. You guessed it, this place does! I ordered some ""volcanos"" and I seriously had to try not to gag instantly and guess who paid extra for stuff I couldn't even swallow? Me. The fish was awful! The muscles were dry. ( you can only have one order of muscles, but after one I don't think I could have stomached more)  The only reason I gave this place two stars is because the staff was really nice. I always had my drink filled and they were really prompt with everything. Also, the cheese wontons were really good, I'm glad that those were edible. I'm not sure you could talk me into going back though.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The food is good, but the service leaves something to be desired. I've ordered from the app several times and only once was my order ready at the time it said to pickup. Today, I actually arrived a few minutes late expecting to wait and stood by the cashier instead of waiting in line - one of the bennies of using the app. The cashier completely ignored me until I finally had to ask if my sandwich was ready. It wasn't. So it took more than 30 minutes from order to pickup. Not ideal for a fast food sandwich joint. They may not survive if this keeps up. Management needs to take some action and get the staff up-to-snuff on proper customer service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"If I could give this place zero stars I would. We walked into this restaurant and wasn't seated for 5mins even though the workers in the back could see us and we could see them. Then when our egg roll appetizers came the server spilled some of the sauce on the table and some of it splashed onto me. The server didn't even apologize and when I asked for napkins the server just pointed at the utensils wrapped in ONE napkin so I asked for extra napkins and he huffed at me. When I got my entree there was hair in my food to top it all off. Mind you there was no other customer in the restaurant besides one other family. So there was no rush or anything. So unprofessional and rude. The customer service was HORRIBLE! And the food was mediocre at best, I recommend just walking down the street to Pho Grand instead.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

There were five of us dining and two of us got our food in a reasonable amount of time but were finished before the other three of us were served.  The place wasn't that busy (10 min wait) and full tables around us had ordered after us and received their food.  It took roughly two hours to finally get our food.  The food was just mediocre, charbroiled oysters were good, seafood platter was just ok (my daughters burger was better), my son had a pasta dish he couldn't eat.  Nothing at this place was worth our bill of $150.  Keep in mind that with a party of 5 or more you will be charged 20% gratuity, which isn't uncommon, but you will be forced to tip for average food and horrible service.

"Moved to the area a year ago. Not sure if they changed chefs, but I feel that the food quality has gone down a bit, with increasingly smaller portions and a move away from choice cuts, so going from pretty good to mediocre in my book.  I am docking a star because I did not have a great customer experience recently. I ordered takeout and when I went to pick it up, lo and behold, they had never filled my order.  They started making it after I arrived. Turns out that they had ""lost"" the order. An hour and 45 minutes later from my call for takeout, food was done.  I recently also had another experience where I called to order food and the call just kept ringing and ringing. It was 9 pm on a weekend so maybe they were busy.

"I have been to this Steak & Shake at least four times and this time is the last.  I will drive out of my way to go to a different Steak & Shake.  I ordered on line thinking I would save some time.  My order should have been ready at 12:55.  I went in at 1:00 told the person at the counter that I was there to pick up my online order.  She went over to the back counter where several bags were sitting but indicated that my order wasn't there.  I sat there for another 15 minutes thinking they were preparing my order.  Finally, I asked another person at the counter to see if they had even received my online order.  Guess what?  My order was sitting with all the other orders on the back counter.  My Patty Melt was cold and disgusting by this time.  I ordered an ice cream sundae and threw it away because the ice cream had freezer burn.  While I was sitting there waiting, another customer came in and ordered a peanut butter/chocolate shake.  Guess what?  They were out of peanut butter.  Someone couldn't go to the grocery store up the street and pick up a few jars of peanut butter?  I went to this Steak and Shake another time and waited in the drive thru for twenty minutes.  When I reached the window I ordered a hot fudge sundae.  After sitting there for 10 minutes the person at the window informed me that they were out of vanilla ice cream.  Does anyone there know how to handle inventory?  I wish I had bothered to read these reviews before.  Each time I was there I assumed that the bad experience was a fluke.

But, after downing a lot of hot fresh chips and an AWESOME salsa - made of tomatoes and finely chopped onions and jalapenos - I was not so ravenous and STILL enjoyed my meal immensely.  I had the seafood enchiladas.  They were covered in a white creamy sauce.  It was great!  Was it the most authentic Mexican meal I'll ever have in my life?  Probably not, but I would go here in a heartbeat after my mediocre experiences at Las Palmas on West End AND Rosepepper in East Nashville!  Sorry 'pepper...  Man, the salsa was awesome.  And a lil' hot, so if you're sensitive, beware.  Cozymel's has one of those frozen drink machines you see in New Orleans, except instead of daquiris Cozymel's has several margarita choices.  We had the mango, it was great.  It wasn't Margaritaville's.. but no margarita is...  I have expressed my love for beans in other Yelp reviews.  I loved 'em!

"I'll start off by saying that the pizza is very good. Absolutely no complaints there. The thing that makes me hesitate to go back there is the god-awful wait time. Even when there's hardly any customers there, the employees are extremely slow and almost seem to intentionally take their time. On top of that, snap Pizza attempts to pressure the customer to add a tip when cashing out. Why on earth would I tip someone who's getting paid minimum wage or more simply to ring me up or make a pizza? Last I checked tips are for bartenders and waitresses etc who are performing a service, not simply doing a job that they're getting paid for, paid for by the expensive prices I'm already paying for the pizza.  In response to the gentleman that replied to my review from snap, if you re-read my reviews sir you will see that I did not write that employees are pressuring customers for a tip, that it is snap pizza as a company that is doing so. Why are you asking customers to tip your employees Who are not making 2.75an hour, such as a waitress or bartender? If snap Pizza is not paying their employees a respectable hourly rate, then do not expect customers to make up for that. We are already paying enough for high-priced pizza",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

For an entree my wife ordered the special, Risotto with shrimp and asparagus and the only thing she said was it could use garlic (she is a garlic junkie).

Curiously, our waitress had much the same attitude: seemed to project a very distracted and rushed air though the restaurant was 90% empty. The menu had a few vegetarian options, but this restaurant -like many others in New Orleans- adds grilled meat to just about every otherwise palatable dish on the menu, presumably to justify the inflated prices.  Our appetizer was good (feta & mascarpone cheese broiled in marinara with toasts). The wine was fine. Our meals left much to be desired, though. I could go through and nit-pick every place where their chef (presuming there is one and not just a boil-in-bag factory in China) went wrong, but I'll let the rating speak for itself.  ...and to think we chose this over Byblos III: home of the best chicken schwarma in the South.

"We had an appointment in this area so decided to give them a try.  Located in a strip mall just west of the River Rd. and Camobell intersection. This was an early dinner for us, roughly 4 PM.  Smallish place with modern decor but still piping in mariachi music.  Outdoor seating also available.  Counter service for ordering food with table delivery.  I ordered the barbacoa quesadilla with calabacitas, my wife got the chicken taquitos with the smashed beans.  The entrees came out quickly and piping hot.  My quesadilla was a large corn tortilla filled with lightly spiced barbacoa, cheese and the house Seis sauce, plus a serving of the medium hot salsa.  The medium hot salsa is basically a souped up tomatillo sauce, but it had a nice flavor with just a hint of bite to it.  The calabacitas only contained zucchini and yellow squash, but they do tell you that on the menu.  It was o.k., but nothing special.  My wife's chicken taquitos were lightly fried and tasted decent, but again nothing special.

I was solidly the only one who knew that song, and I totally made a fool of myself. Anyway, this is a legitimately Mexican Restaurant. MEXICAN. Not Dominican, Cuban, Guatemalan, .... How can you tell? Real homemade tortillas and corn tortillas too. Go to any spanish restaurant and try an enchilada, and you'll know if they're half assing. This is real Mexican food.  They. Do. Not. Play. It makes me reminisce of my home state and I wish my friend were still around so we could go there more often for the occasional 2 for 1 mojitos and margaritas.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I had high expectations for this place that is so highly coveted. My family and I came on a Saturday morning around 9:30. The wait was around 15 minutes so not too bad.   Once seated, our order and drinks were taken and delivered very quickly and courteously. The meal arrived shortly after so kuddos for fast service.   Now on to the meal.  My wife and I each had the Eggs Benedict.  The portion was as expected with some fruit as garnish. The eggs were perfectly poached. The Canadian bacon was, in my opinion, too thickly sliced. It dominated the dish. The hollandaise was borderline broken and the English muffin was greasey.  Overall, we were both very disappointed.   Our daughter had a single pancake. It too was a very decent portion as it covered the entire 10"" plate. Alas even this was a let down. A nice crust was present but the texture was flat and again overly greasy. There was also a flavor of a well seasoned flat iron. Normally this would be fine but when it becomes overly powerful, maybe its time for a scrubbing. If I wanted a burger aftertaste, I would have gone to their other location.   Lastly on to the donuts or Bubs Holes. When the waitress asked if we were interested in some, we had a bit of a pause until we realized what she actually said.  ""Butt holes?"", my wife inquired after our waitress left.  We had a small laugh about that and the unfortunate name these fried dough balls were given. Not to sound like a broken record but again these were overly greasy, overly sweet, and extremely dense. The only good thing about them was the fact they were fried to order. The truth is, we ate two between us three and tossed the rest.   All in all we consider this breakfast a waste of $48 after our meals, two coffees, and tip.  There are several better breakfast spots in the area that we will just stick to from now on. The hype for this place is a shame. As my wife stated, they should stick to what they are good at, and that is delicious burgers.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I'm a Dewey's fan allllll the way, and after having lunch today for the first time at Pi I can say that I wasn't super impressed. What's up with all the hype?  Maybe I went to the wrong one, but this location wasn't what I was expecting. I can see how the patio would be a nice option, but we opted for inside. Four people at a four top was pretty cramped, and my elbow was against the edge of the windowsill. The servers were nice and attentive, but the dining area was pretty small so even at half capacity it was on the loud side.  Drinks. I went for the Schlafly Hefeweizen after trying a sample of the Bell's Two Hearted Ale, which was not my speed. How about some Bell's Oberon? Also, my go-to drink, ice tea, was nonexistent because they only have mango infused tea. What place doesn't have standard unsweetened tea? On the bright side, Schlafly lovers can unite here because Pi is REPRESENTING with like seven Schlafly options. Anyway though the Hefeweizen was $4.50 for a pint, which is reasonable.   I split the small Bada Bing salad (dried bing cherries, almonds, gorgonzola) and it was very good. The field greens were fresh and it was tossed in an okay raspberry vinaigrette (a tad oily, maybe?). For $6 it's big enough to split and they even give you some tongs to dish it out, which is a nice touch.  We went for the 9"" deep dish, half Western Addition half Castro for $18. The 9"" is a good size to share with three slices each, and we didn't even finish it all. I wasn't a fan of the Western Addition, but the Castro was good. The tomato ""sauce"" was the major flavor hit to the point that it almost overpowered the other ingredients, and the cornmeal crust was pretty tough to cut through and not all that tasty.    What I learned:  -You can do half and half on the pizzas -You can do the thin crust pi options in the deep dish form -Go small, because it's a lot of food -I'll stick with Dewey's",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This place has so much potential but a lot of work to do! We started at the bar where the bartenders were nice as could be but still learning drink recipes three weeks in. Unfortunately when we sat down it got worse. It took us 20 minutes to get a drink, our food came out 2 minutes later. I ordered the Jidori Chicken and the mashed cauliflower was freezing cold and it was missing the black beans. My fiancé had the enchiladas and thought they were good.

"Been here many times but our last visit left us feeling disgruntled, mainly due to the service.  We arrived after the lunch rush for the day and the restaurant wasn't very busy but our server, Lexani I believe, was not very attentive.  She was also working the bar this day and was more interested in completing her busy work requirements in order to end her shift.  I had a clear view of the kitchen and could see the first part of our order sitting up at the pass-thru for almost 15 mins before she brought it to us.  The manager on duty walked by our food sitting up there multiple times, ignoring it.  At one point he was chatting with someone on his cell phone. Eventually I finished my drink and wanted a refill.  The cup sat empty for over 10 mins before I asked a server that wasn't our server for a refill.  Our salad plates and my empty cup sat on our table for over 35 mins until our main course came to the table, via the manager this time because our server was still too busy for us.  The manager cleared our dirty plates, one of which had a dead fly on it that I killed, because they were flying all around restaurant (See pic) Our food this time wasn't as good, but I'm sure some of that was psychological since we weren't happy with our service. For the record, we did leave her a 16% tip but are used to tipping much more for good service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"""It took 5 phone calls, 2 emails, and 25 days to receive a $20 check (not even the entire amount I was overcharged).

Like I said, the music was good and the place was cool,  but Nashville is eaten up with cool music places.""  The place is cool. The music was great. The food was bad. The service was horrendous, and then a few days later I saw where I had been overcharged for more than $20.  And, when I say horrendous, I mean nearly 30 minutes before we saw a server (the place was not busy). We saw her when the food came, but never saw her again. We had to flag down someone else to ask for another beer and water, though the water never came. Then, we waited a good bit at the end of the evening trying to catch a glimpse of her to get a check, eventually just going to the front of the place and asking for it.   Then, of course, charged $50 on a $24 bill.  I talked to a manager by phone who sounded pretty aggravated to field the call. Their calls roll to their personal phones. Service industry don't live in the office... It wasn't the attitude you would expect on calling to report an overcharge, and there was even a tone at one point like I might be making this shit up or something.  I didn't hear back from him for 5 days, at which point I contacted the owner.  He was sympathetic and accommodating at first,  and agreed to refund the entirety of my bill.   I waited for 2 weeks, but the check never came.  I contacted him again and he was less than caring. A reply email that he meant to mail it 2 weeks ago; but had an emergency; but actually did just run across it yesterday and it was on its way.  The check did arrive after another request, but not only was it not for the entire bill, it was not even for the entire amount of the overcharge.   He did include 2 tickets to get in the door; like I would want to experience this again.  Both of these guys double-talked so much they couldn't keep it all straight, not for some schmuck like me. It was palpable when you talked to them and evident in their actions.  It took 5 phone calls, 2 emails, and 25 days to receive a $20 check (not even the entire amount I was overcharged).

"Make no mistake, this is a bar that serves bar food. The decor is more that of a Sports Bar than an Irish Bar and I am pretty sure there were still Christmas decorations up.   I read the Yelp reviews and decided to try it after not having been there in many years.  It was crowded on a Friday night which I thought was a good sign.  We were seated after waiting only a few minutes then waited 10 minutes for our waitress.  We ordered drinks and waited 10 more minutes for them to come.  We were given menus and when she eventually came back to take our order we waited another 20 minutes for the food.  I had the driest salmon ever,my husband had a greasy cheese steak and one of our dinning companions had a chicken sandwich that was all bread.  At this point our waitress disappeared.

"I've heard amazing things about Paladar 511, and finally got a chance to grab brunch with a friend at this beautiful location right past Elysian Fields on Marigny St.   The location is beautiful. If I could live in it I would. Tall, communal tables with fresh flowers, large booths for big groups, what looks to be a private dining area upstairs, and comfortable upholstered chairs. Vampires beware, a ton of natural light, open kitchen, and beautiful chandeliers.   Their brunch menu is simple, with ten items and a choice of some sides. Our waitress was extremely patient with us since my friend was struggling to choose between various dishes (a good thing, in my opinion).   I enjoyed the Bloody Mary. Freshly-made with horseradish, but not really spicy, just a solid drink with a celery, lemon, onions and green bean garnish.   We ordered the yellowfin tuna crudo ( $14), korean steak and eggs ($14), and the spicy breakfast pizza ($14).   The Yellowfin tuna crudo's flavors were bright and fresh (running theme here). Fennel, navel orange, avocado, and chunks of tuna with roasted pistachios and a very light cumin-lime vinaigrette.   The Korean steak and eggs was a generous portion that I gobbled up. Braised short ribs, shiitake mushrooms, rice, and fried egg with chives, red cabbage, and sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I would say snap your pretty pictures, and then mix it all together so that you get a bit of everything in every bite. I did need some more spice to it, and they have every complementary version of hot sauce you could ask for: Crystal, Tabasco, Cholula, Sriracha... I went with Sriracha and this worked best for me to bring out the flavors! Every bit of this dish was delicious and paired incredibly well with the other ingredients. I picked through the rice to finish off the bits of shiitake mushrooms.   I was probably hitting full at this point and tastebuds shutting down, so I don't know if I can give the best rep of the spicy breakfast pizza. I didn't feel like it was spicy, but the tomato sauce had this sweet, homemade deliciousness to it. I'm not a big egg-on-pizza person, but again, I didn't eat much in the way of the pizza since I was killing the Korean steak and eggs.   What I gather from this location is that they're not going to over season anything, and want the ingredients that they're using to all be able to come out on their own without blanketing them with one particular part of the recipe. If you like more kick, or spice, ask for it.   This brunch menu was just a tease.

"Food = Excellent (reason this is 2 star instead of 1 star)  Service/Experience = Terrible.  This was my second trip to Chuy's Nashville.  I was there a few months ago (Christmas) and the service was slow but not ridiculous.  This week, was another story!  I took colleagues out for dinner.  Here is our 2 hour experience as succinctly as possible: -  Arrival good, only had to wait 10 minutes or so. -  Arrival bad, no silverware - hostess advised she would bring some out shortly (she never did) - Server (""JC""), really terrible.  He was slow, acted like he didn't want to be there, and when he was asked what choices of beans they had, his response was, ""I don't know, look at the menu.""  Seriously JC?  Aren't you supposed to KNOW what beans you have? -  Appetizer plate and queso order took more than 30 minutes - Dinner order took almost an hour!  We were in the restaurant right at two hours, it was ridiculous.  Even more ridiculous, the lack of professionalism.  After waiting for entrees for ~35-40 minutes, we asked for a manager - he didn't arrive.  After a few minutes more we asked to see the manager a second time, he didn't arrive (we were told he was in the kitchen helping with food).  A few minutes more, we ask for manager a THIRD TIME.  JC responded, ""do you want him to come out here or get your food?"".  The table next to us had a similar experience - waiting a LONG time for food, their kids were crying that they wanted to go home, it was a joke!  Finally the food and the manager arrives.  Basically he said they were busy and, ""having one of those days"".  Then, for the really odd part, when the check comes, JC dropped it and walked off.  I take a peak and see that all of our meals were comped.  While this was a nice gesture, I found it SHOCKING that JC nor the manager said a word.  No, ""sorry this happened, allow us to comp your meal"" or ""please give us another try later"", he just dropped the check and walked off.  Very strange and unprofessional.  BTW, JC really is a terrible waiter - he had to be ""flagged down"" to come to our table, would disappear for 20 minutes at a time, had to be asked multiple times for everything from drink refills to salsa, napkins, etc.  He was curt, had attitude, and had to rely on other servers to help him out.  At the end of the day, the food here is really good but I have to seriously question the management at this location.  I've had SIGNIFICANTLY better experiences at other Chuy's (i.e. - in Knoxville).  Like the front of the door says, ""If you've seen one Chuy's - you've seen one Chuy's"".

"Came here today during my lunch break at work. Surprisingly, there was no wait today! Definite plus.  Atmosphere here is bright, friendly, and welcoming. I love the space they've created here. Service has been consistently attentive, and I've never run out of water here. You can tell that they pay attention to their customers.  I either get the tonkotsu or aka ramen, depending on the feels. It's hard to find a place with good Asian soup, and I've found other asian noodle places in SB/Goleta rather disappointing so far.  The broth here is good! I've had better, but in terms of flavor, I find myself craving it every couple of weeks, and I keep coming back with new coworkers.  Unfortunately, I have a few points that keeps me from giving this place a higher rating.  Price. You're paying $11 + tip/tax and $11.50 + tip/tax for the tonkotsu ramen and aka ramen, respectively. It's not a very large bowl, and compared to places I regularly frequent while visiting friends/family in LA and the OC, it's frankly overpriced. For the quantity you're getting here, I'd expect the price to be lower. They don't really give you a ton in terms of toppings either. You really need to add extra toppings to your bowl if you want more.  Noodles. Previously, I said that the broth is good. I stand by that, but the noodles are sloppy. Some days are better than others, but today was especially bad. Definitely felt overcooked and had a slimy and mushy texture.  If this place used larger bowls or gave an option for small/large bowls with small bowls being a bit cheaper, and improved their noodle quality, I'd happily give Nikka Ramen 5 stars. Until then, I'll just savor the broth.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

So she is thinking I'm getting soup and anchovies but didn't miss a beat, brought the soup and a side of anchovies.  The misunderstanding was quickly resolved and we both enjoyed our salads.  We also got some wonderful bread and seasoned olive oil dipping sauce.  On to the mains, my wife got the pasta bolognese and I got the chicken pizziaola, she raved about the pasta and the chicken was incredible.  Chicken breasts cooked perfectly with fontina cheese, an incredible light tomato sauce and capers rounded it out, perfectly seasoned and I love capers.  We had enough for leftovers, but I have to admit, after getting home from the show, I finished the chicken.  Tremendous experience all around.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Service was good, being a Monday and knowing there are staffing issue around. Food was great but the fries were cold. I asked for warm fries and they replaced them. The fries that they brought were overcooked and seemed like they throw in old fries and heated them. My sons tater tots were way over cooked as well. Fix that and I can get you a higher score.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Ever since leaving sunny California in August (2018) I have been on a search, scratch that on the prowl for a burrito to satisfy this California native. Don't get me wrong Nashville has decent burritos but I was coming to terms that one, I might have to lower my standards and two- Chipotle might have to be that standard (shudder). While having one of those burritos cravings naturally I turned to Yelp! Taco Mama came up, I noticed my fellow elites had great things to say about Taco Mama and those pictures....those picture were giving me FOMO! I literally scream at the fam to get in the car its a burrito emergency!  There are paid parking spaces but this girl wants to save on parking so I can enjoy a margarita so we search high and low and found free street parking. Aside from saving on $$ when you park a few blocks away there are some other perks. For starters parking far lets you walk off your meal, even better you get to bookmark, window shop and explore   (maybe even shop) the chic boutique shops they have along the way.  Right away the menu might seem overwhelming but take a deep breath in they have easy items you can order or customize as well as build your own burrito/bowl what ever your hungry heart desires. Honestly, for the price you pay you get a hearty full meal! Taco Mama has restored my faith in burritos in this town! They aren't your traditional authentic burritos but at the same time they are game and have elevated the standard. I ordered the steak and the meat was an explosion on flavor with the tenderness of mama's love. Hubby had the al pastor (he loves his al pastor) and he is a bigger snob than I am - he could not get enough!   I have to give a huge shout out to the team at Taco Mama, they are friendly, attentive and truly care to give the optimal customer service. While I will continue to explore Nashville's burrito scene Taco Mama is definitely going be my burrito go to joint!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Pancakes were decent and I had a chili Verde omelet that was good, but the home fries were mostly burnt.  Wife had an ahi sandwich which she said was under seasoned.  But oh my goodness was the service terrible.  Had to ask 4 times to get water for kids.  Waitress brought out the food over such a long period of time, some of us had finished our food before others even got to start on theirs.  She was so discombobulated that she put everyone's food at the wrong spot, so we just had to keep passing it to the right person.

"Let me start with the positives. Friendly, attentive staff. Wings and fries were tasty. After that, everything else went downhill. Ordered nachos as appetizer and on the surface they looked wonderful. When you start digging into them, you realize that there was very little substance to them. Everything piled on top instead of layered throughout and there was barely any chicken on the chicken nachos. Overpriced for what we received. Kitchen needs to do better! My friend ordered the filet mignon. It took longer than usual for us to get our food. Here's my theory: they didn't have a filet that wasn't frozen so they had to pull it out of the freezer, defrost it and then cook it. When it finally came out, what is supposed to be the tenderest piece of meat off of the cow was extremely tough and hard. I actually think they didn't defrost it all the way tried to cook it partly still frozen. We told the manager about it who seemed genuinely sorry and concerned. He offered to make good which was expected but nice. Bottom line, the kitchen needs an overhaul. Hope they can get it together.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Tried the two new sushi rolls that was revealed yesterday: the Snowstorm Roll and the Super Alaskan Roll. Really enjoyed the Snowstorm roll because of the tempura shrimp inside.

"My friend and I meet monthly for breakfast.  We've been attempting to try new places.  This is a tiny restaurant with no public restroom.  You order at the register then your food is delivered to the table.  They have a small, yet unique menu.  Depending on what you're looking for, it's a bit expensive.  I paid around $20.  Elsewhere, you could get a huge breakfast for less.  The meal was okay.  I had enough to eat from it two times.  My friend joined me and ordered based off the appearance of my meal.  Mine was packaged to go so the sauces weren't on the platter.  When my friend's arrived, her entree was sitting atop two sauces.  Neither of us like spicy foods so she was disappointed.  Hers was delivered as an eat in meal.  They did replace the meal.  I didn't hate it but I'm not excited to return.

"This is a deli style restaurant with counter service. Order your food and the server brings it to your table. The featured item seemed to be the gyro so I went for it. It was $5.99 for a small gyro, drink and fries. Not a bad lunch deal at all. The gyro was average--it had good flavor but was on the very greasy side. While I was eating the gyro, the extra grease dripped into my already greasy basket of fries. The fries were your run of the mill, frozen, crinkle cut fries. Nothing exciting.  I read from other reviews that the sweet potato fries are delicious. I wanted to substitute my regular fries for the sweet potato and was willing to pay an extra cost if need be--but the kid behind the counter so no way. Oh well.   For some reason, the tzaziki sauce comes on the side and so I had to add it to my gyro. The problem is that the gyro is stuffed to the gills so I could only add the sauce to the top. Maybe I am being picky but I hate eating food where there is sauce on the top half but no sauce on the bottom half. Its kind of like when Taco Bell squeezes all of the sour cream into the bottom of their burritos. No sour cream in your burrito until you get to the end. And then there is one massive glob of sour cream and you don't want to eat it.   It's ok for a quick lunch time bite but I have definitely had better gyros at Little Greek or Louis Pappas.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
Finally made it in to the oink for breakfast! Don't get breakfast out often.  You must try the flight of bacon.  My favorite was the pumpkin spice bacon. The only part that could have been better if the bacon was served greater than room temperature.  The french toast was basic thick cut egg battered no excitement there.  The pork confit omelette was better than a plain omelet.  There was not enough of the confit pork to make it special.  The eggs overpowered everything. I was hoping to taste the special cooked pork more.  The coffee was tasty and hot but had to ask for refills each time.  Wife had a cappuccino and she loved it.  I would say it's a novelty breakfast definitely worth a try.  Di the bacon flight I hope yours comes hot not room temperature.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I thought it was so cool when i first walked in, they tables had tons of chop sticks and Asian spoons with hand full of sauces. I really didn't know what to order started off with egg rolls that were damn good, better then most egg rolls i have had before i wanted a bag of them to go lol. My wife ordered some kind of lime drink that came with a bottle of soda water then she mixed with some lime juice concoction, it tasted good a little tart for my taste but still pretty good. The food came out really fast, and holy Devil balls hot. I burnt my tongue on a 200 degree piece of broccoli. Not there fault i wasn't paying attention and instead of testing the temp i just popped in my mouth. The fried rice was very good i eat it so fast my shirt had rice all over it. Can't remember the name of the dish but it had beef chicken & Shrimp mixed with veggies stir fried and everything i had was great. My wife ordered some kind of rice noodle with chicken. Don't know what they did to that chicken to taste so damn good and still be very tender. Everyone at my table really enjoyed there food. I can't wait to go back and try something else. While i was letting my food digest my wife went over the the bakery side, they had some cool things, i got some peanut candy that was great.

This option was already in thought when we went, so we made a reservation and reserved a booth.  Reserve the booth if you haven't - it's a great view.  There's all of 3 of them.  Facing the all glassed in kitchen.  Very nice kitchen.  Clean, neat, watch your steak get grilled.  So my husband had the Cowboy ribeye.  WOW it's pricey.  Not his favorite cut because it's so fatty.  It was good, but he wouldn't do that steak again. Nice touch with the huge bone and his initials carved into it.  But he'd go with a strip steak next time.  My porterhouse was nice.  A little too much fat on the strip side for me. More leftovers for dinner 2 nights later....  It was good, but I wouldn't get it again for that price (everything is a la carte like a lot of steakhouses, but not all....)  My Mom got the pork chop milenesa.  Now.  This was FABULOUS.  I had some of it for leftovers 3 days later and OMG it was WONDERFUL and one of the less expensive entree choices on the menu.  Seriously spectacular.  We had a shrimp cocktail  It was 4 jumbo shrimp.  For $18.  Really?  They could have done 6 shrimp and at 3 bucks a piece would have still made a killer margin on them.  They were good, don't get me wrong, but not worth $18 for 4.  The cocktail sauce was awesome!  We had the lobster bisque.  I split it with my husband.  It was really good.  Top of the line.  One of the best, flavor-wise.  It was just a tiny bit loose.  Overall, very very good.  And we would get it again and split it!  We all 3 split one salad.  It was definitely enough.  We all split a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  They were good.  And we all split the tower of onion rings.  They were oily and don't reheat well (even broiled).  Overall, we'd go again but we wouldn't get those steaks and wouldn't make a special trip. Now that we have experienced quite a bit on the menu.  We still have to try the seafood side and we will order much less food!  We didn't get to try dessert - will have to save room next time.

"Went for the New Year's Buffet. What a joke! The buffet was $30 per person and so, so not worth the price. The whole experience was just wrong.   First of all we had to take a shifty elevator up to the second floor, together with the frantic servers and bus boys. Then, the food was right there, in a small alcove right in front of the elevator! Upon getting off the elevator, we bumped into a few patrons who were getting the buffet food, because the space was very narrow and awkward. Then, I noticed one of the bus boys sneaking some of the food off the buffet and earing desperately, huddled by the elevator.  The food itself was cold; the flimsy little serving tray warmers were not sufficient to ward off the cold air people were bringing in via the elevator. Honestly, the presentation of the food itself in that buffet looked like a make-shift continental style buffet you see at those hotel training seminars.   I can only say that the food, had it not been cold, was actually quite good. Very good food.  To add to the experience, somehow Champagne was sold only by the bottle, their Chai tea was all 'out' at 9pm. And the waitress we had was so busy that we were long done eating before she came back to bring our Coke, and tell me that Chai was all out and they were done making it for the night.  I must have had high expectations, because even décor upstairs seemed drab and a little creepy. There was no artwork no the walls, our table was one of the outdoor ones. I kept hitting my shin on a metal bar underneath.   I can tell you, honestly, that was one miserable experience for the both of us. And the final bill of $79 was absolutely a slap in the face.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Heard this place was good and decided to drive for 45 ming and give it a try on valentines day, which was a bad decision! Buffet was priced at 17.99 which I think was overpriced for the quality of food. The food itself was not spicy and did not have enough flavors. Meat was under cooked, which we complained to the manager who apologized and said he would replace the curry, which never happened. There was no meat in the chicken biriyani and no eggs in egg curry, when we complained about it, the representative was very rude and said ""we are too busy now and trying our best to refill as fast as we can, please bare with us""!!!

"I was there not too long ago for a special event.   One would think that if they were having a sold-out special event that could potentially introduce a large group of people to their establishment they would step up their game a little bit.   It was a terrible experience. I don't think I'll ever go back.   I waited for about 20 minutes for any service whatsoever. Finally being impatient, we asked someone if we could see a server. About 20 minutes later after checking in with this person a number of times we got a server and placed our order. And about 20 minutes after that we got our order.  And of course when I got my drink it wasn't exactly what I ordered. But it was close enough so I dealt with it. (I wasn't going to wait another 20 minutes to find a server and wait for another drink--the show would have been over).   I had ordered a margherita pizza--which, by the way isn't really French. This was no margherita pizza It was the kind of doughy pizza with cheap cheese that you got at your elementary school cafeteria but with one little bit of basil on top. My friends ""cheesesteak rolls""--also not French--tasted as though they were bought in a supermarket frozen food aisle.   Well that very not French, not very good food gave us food poisoning. We were both sick for days--I fared much worse than she did.   In addition to that we had requested separate checks from the very beginning which of course we didn't get and had to wait for them to re-do the check.   And are they really trying to be French? The food wasn't very French and the servers (when we saw them--which was rarely) kept saying little French things like ""merci"" and ""bon jeuer"" but kind of half-assed the way that customer service people on the phone are forced to say things like ""it is my pleasure to help you today.""  I did go to the bar to get another drink because I certainly wasn't going to wait for the server. I paid in cash and was surprised to see they got my change out of a metal box behind the bar. No cash register. Is that how French people do it?  God, I hated this place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

This place just opened up down the street from my place. This is my first post on yelp simply because I was so frustrated with the service and food that I was compelled to write something  First off I came I and all I wanted was a gyro sandwich. I saw the meat cooking on a spit and rotating like you usually do and expected the meat to be cut off and put on. Sandwich with some veggies. Boy was I wrong.   I sat in the restaurant for 45 waiting for my sandwich seeing that no one touched the meat yet and even at one point another group to dine in came after me and were served before. Finally someone started on my sandwich 40 minutes after I ordered it!!!! That's a lot of waiting for a sandwich that was ok at best.

"I am so glad this place is here! Bryn Mawr certainly isn't on anyone's list of cuisine destinations, and being vegetarian or vegan can be hard if you're looking for places to eat - and not just in Bryn Mawr, but on the Main Line and in the Philadelphia suburbs in general. So, now there's a casual vegan place 5 minutes away from my house. And since I've been home for the winter holidays, I've already been there three times. The restaurant is bright, inviting, and very clean. The people there are always pretty friendly.  So far, my sister and I have tried the veggie cheesesteak, BBQ Seitan, Bahn Mi, and the creamy kale soup. The sandwiches all come with kale chips, but not that many, so you're better off ordering a side of them. The kale chips are tasty, but I wish you got more bang for your buck because I could easily go through a lot.  The first time I was there I had the BBQ Seitan on a whole wheat wrap. It was so delicious and it had caramelized onions and a hearty amount of sautéed kale. I did add a little ketchup for extra zest, but my sister had one the second time she was there and said she liked it the way it was. She had the Banh Mi and said it was really tasty, but that she wouldn't order it on the bread again, because while the bread was good, they cut it kind of thick and it's really filling. The veggie cheesesteak was also pretty good, kind of like the BBQ Seitan, but it also has some extra veggies: mushrooms and peppers. The use Daiya vegan cheese, which is okay, but I can't say I'm a huge fan of the flavor. It added a nice creaminess to the cheesesteak, but I'd rather go without it. I had the creamy kale soup with the cheesesteak and it was very tasty and filling. I'm excited to try their chili and the falafal next time I'm in town.  I haven't tried the desserts, which I heard are from a local baker, but they all look delicious.  Also, I was delighted when I found out that they compost everything except the bottles and cans! The cups and silverware are made from corn. Vge doesn't fry anything, they don't use canned vegetables, and they're ""organic when they can,"" which is good. And the bathrooms are really nice, which is a HUGE plus in my book.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

But the food quality and flavor were terrible.  The chicken was hard and dry and bitter and consisted of tough cold chunks.  The lettuce was limp and the flavors very odd - sour and bitter - a scary food combination.  One bright spot was the perfectly ripe fresh avocado.  But overall, it tasted bad/spoiled/inedible.

"Went for Sunday brunch to meet a friend who lives in the area. Neither of us had been before. We both had reviewed the menu in advance and were excited to try it. The interior is nice. Bold wall colors and everything looks pretty new, cool outdoor lounge seating.   My friend and I both started out with the Mimosa/Bloody Mary bar. Unlimited, make your own for $10. Your server brings you a glass and you get started on your own. They provide ice, booze, mixers, and garnishes. The mimosa bar had sparkling wine, several types of oj (mango oj, pineapple oj, etc) different berries and syrups and liquors for mix-ins. I enjoyed my mimosa and my friend liked her bloody mary that she jazzed up with shrimp, pepper, pickles, olives, etc.   We returned to the table to find our basket of  ""fresh baked pastries"" (according to their menu). These pastries were sad. There was a small scone, a mini cinnamon wheel, and a raspberry danish. All looked like the standard pastries you would find at a hotel's continental breakfast. I would be shocked if they weren't from Costco or the like. The first basket is free with brunch, seconds are $6.   Soon our brunch arrived. My friend ordered the Mediterranean omelet and I had the Quiche Lorraine with fresh fruit (instead of potatoes). Their Quiche Lorraine contained 3 kinds of diced bell peppers (not mentioned anywhere on the menu and not traditional to Quiche Lorraine). Well, I can't eat those so I asked for something else. The manager quickly came over and I asked for scrambled eggs/the traditional breakfast instead. He apologized and brought the dish right out. A dish of heaping scrambled eggs. Nothing else. Whatever. I ate it, they were fine but when the bill came they still charged me for the quiche. The waiter told me that the traditional breakfast that I got was the same price so he left it on. I then inquired what else came with the traditional since I only got eggs (and the side of fruit I took off the plate when they took it away). He told me that it also came with asparagus but I didn't want those (when he was taking away the pepper quiche he did ask me if I wanted to keep my asparagus to which I declined figuring they would be re-plating a new meal for me, not that  that would be my only option for a side item). Ugh. I didn't feel like fighting with the waiter about the price but he went to find the manager. Nobody came by and he then dropped my check with a charge for a side of eggs and a side of fruit. Fine. I paid.   During this debacle, we went back for seconds on our drinks. My friend works in the restaurant industry (in corporate) and I worked in the industry for almost 10 years. My friend pointed to the ice bucket next to the bloody mary bar. It had a plastic to-go bag inside which held all the ice. She then, noting that plastic to-go bags are NOT food safe, went to the bartender to get a fresh glass and fresh ice. I appreciate the service staff's ingenuity but it shows a lack of training on the management side that something like that would be allowed.   In a nutshell, meh. I probably won't be back.

The sushi was that good and the price just right. Well yesterday I witnessed the most unprofessional behavior from any manager I've ever seen that ensures I will never step foot through their doors again.  As I was ordering and things getting dropped off to me, I saw the table next to me try twice to get the servers attention, but she didn't see them. They stopped another server and said they had a roll neither of them liked, but they weren't finished, could he take it. He went and got their server, a lady whom I've had before and she speaks terrible English. Next thing I know, I hear her raising her voice at them. Then Joy, the manager, comes over. Seriously ... within a minute Joy is yelling. She told them they have no common sense and they should have gotten a server immediately if they didn't like the roll (apparently they were talking ... plus I saw ... no one came over!) The girls at the table explained they didn't like this one, they still weren't finished, but they're not paying $1 a piece for a roll they didn't like (we're talking $5 here) . The phone rings, Joy SCREAMS across a restaurant for someone to pick it up. She's yelling at the table. Told them they shouldn't have ordered so much. She threatened to call the police. She told them they act like they've never been in a restaurant before. She walked away to get their check and could be heard across the restaurant talking about them!! She kept saying she talked to the owner about this and when the table asked for him, she disappeared and never got the owner.   It was deplorable. And I sat 2 feet away with my 6 year old while she belittled this table! I get that they have a policy, but it's poorly marked on the menu and not once has anyone ever told me about it when I ordered. Regardless, I've never seen a manager treat someone so poorly. She was rude, loud, aggressive and flat out mean.   When I said she was chatty before? I stop in while my little girl is at a club for a few hours every week. Since I'm alone, and always bring my Kindle, apparently that still means come talk to me. I've heard about this managers kid, that she gives her boyfriend supplements to assist with his libido, etc. One day I got an earful about her thoughts on the owners wife, who stops in the restaurant when she's in town ... and I don't know these people! She keeps a cordless phone in her back pocket and stops taking your order to answer and makes you wait while she's on the phone!! At your table!! SO unprofessional.  Until she's gone, I won't be back. Which also means the family I stop in with on special occasions also won't be back. And the friends I've brought in also won't be coming.

"Ok, there are a few elements to South to be reviewed.   First is the ""club"" side, which you will get after 9 on Fri and Sat.  I am not one to typically like dancing and the trash that usually follows that music, but I was really pleasantly surprised with South at night. The crowd is upscale, there is a small cover and dress code, and the music was fab. A lot of 90's early 00's hip hop mixed in with some of the catchier recent hits. Kept the ladies dancing all night.   I have also been here for food. The food itself was well above average. I had the fish and chips, made with catfish. I am not one to normally enjoy catfish, but I was told I had to try it and it was delish. Problem occurred about a bit later when I felt like someone had stabbed my stomach and I projectile vomited everywhere.   I don't want to pass final judgement on the food until I go back, because I have good friends who eat here frequently and have never had an issue. It may have just been a bum piece of fish. If the food sits as well as it tastes next time, I will drop 5 stars on South, as everything else is spot on.

My family and I dined at Veekoo tonight. Recently my sister was diagnosed with a moderate allergy to gluten. When ordering her food she made sure to note that she had the allergy and asked that her food be made gluten free with gluten free soy sauce. When our food arrived we all dived right in and shortly she noticed that her sushi had a crunch like there was tempura mixed in. My mom tried it and sure enough there was. Within minutes my sister had bright red hives all over her neck. We called the waitress over and asked her if she had made sure that the sushi was made gluten free and she seemed confused. Turns out she didn't really understand what it meant and never relayed the allergy any of the chefs and or managers. After the food was returned the manager came out to apologize. We tried to explain the severity of the situation. That in this case my sister would be uncomfortable but she would live but someone else with an allergy might not have been so lucky. The manager although apologetic didn't seem too worried. I felt like the situation was treated the same way a manager would treat a customer that had been served an over cooked meal.  I would not advise anyone who has an allergy to eat there.  I'm really disappointed that they don't take things like this seriously because like I said to the manager someone could really get hurt.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"This restaurant came with high recommendations from friends.  Let me start with what I liked: The chimichurri sauce was amazing and the skirt steak.  Now onto what could be improved: We had made a reservation 4 days prior, because we had 6 in our party.  When we arrived the hostess said she didn't have any reservations.  It turned out not to be a problem as we were seated quickly.  Once seated, our server, Donte, took our drink order - which we had to repeat several times.  After some time, he comes back to confirm the drink order, which was incorrect then leaves. I would say it was about 10 minutes for us to get 2 waters and glasses for white sangria.  It was an additional 10 minutes for the last person in our party to get their coke.   After he delivered the beverages we placed our orders, we had 2 appetizers and 6 main courses. We watched as other tables ordered after and received food before us.  The waiter came over to apologize for the delay in the kitchen (even though the place was not nearly at capacity).  Finally the entrees arrived BEFORE the appetizers.  The waiter came over and started with, ""Guess what happened.""  I responded with ""Our empanadas went to another table."" He said yes.  No asking if we still wanted the appetizers or not, but the entrees were already there and were hot, so we wanted to eat those while fresh.  After a few minutes of us eating our entrees, the appetizers come out.  At this point we really didn't want them, but they were put down.  Both appetizers, the empanadas and melted provolone, were not very good. The melted provolone dish, I imagined sat there while the empanadas were being made, as it was just a moderately warm disk of provolone.      I had the rib eye, I was supremely underwhelmed by the taste and preparation.  The bit of skirt steak I had was delicious.  After we finished the entrees, the waiter came over to tell us that dessert was on the house due to the service, which we didn't want because we had dessert plans already.    When the bill came, there were no comps, no discounts, and no management came to our table, even though they had been visiting other tables that night.  I would not come back to this place nor would I recommend it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Well, I wouldn't call these burgers ""giant,"" but I certainly call them tasty!  I really should eat here more.  This place serves up no-nonsense, good, old-fashioned burgers.  The burger itself tastes like it came right off Dad's grill, the lettuce, onions, and tomato are crisp and fresh, and the whole thing comes wrapped in white paper.  Throw in a bag of their AMAZING fries, and you're good to go!  Don't come here looking for a big selection or a great place to sit and eat--although they do have some tables inside and a few tables outside--this is mainly a place for good take-out.

My most recent visit was a little disappointing...maybe it was the multiple hand grenades I had consumed prior to all my previous visits that made the food better.

"I was very excited to try Starr's new restaurant recently, but was sadly disappointed with the underwhelming and over priced food. My husband and I ate here recently and were really impressed with the decor--totally hit the mark with the ""Nantucket"" feel--and their superb service.  What we weren't impressed with was their ""ok"" food at outrageous prices. Don't get me wrong, I am definitely willing to drop a pretty penny for some amazing food....but $200 for a few boiled shrimp, a few raw oysters, 1 lobster and 1 soup....it's a but much, don't you think? (also a cucumber salad and fried clams...but still). The seafood stew which I was very excited to try was very disappointing--the tomato broth was super rich (not in a good way) and one dimensional in flavor and the seafood all cooked down to one flavor.   I am a big fan of most of the Starr restaurants but this one was a ""no-go"" for me....sorry Stephen :/",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
First time here. I am not a huge fried-chicken fan so I ordered a chicken salad sandwich along with parmesan fries and a drink.   The parmesan fries had a lot of Parmesan on them and were skinny and tasty! I also liked their craft sodas with my favorites being black cherry and creme.  I absolutely did not like the chicken salad sandwich. I did not even finish it. It wise dry and very compacted like the chicken was shredded down way too much.

"I'm not one to go out of my way to write negative reviews but after our service tonight I felt the need. I understand they just reopened for the season and the wait staff is new but the place was basically empty, our waitress had to have only 4-5 tables and we had to wait nearly 15-20 minutes for her to even approach us to see if we wanted new drinks. There were times when she would walk past us right to the back without even looking in our direction or not even be on the floor, for more than 10 minutes at a time.  It became so frustrating we decided to go up to the bar and order, which was half empty and we were completely ignored. My sister finally got the bartenders attention but his response to her asking for a drink was ""Can you move over you are standing where the waitresses pick up drinks."" Just rude.   Additionally we thought we saw on their Facebook that Coronas were $4, it was Cinco De Mayo and all. We asked the waitress and her response was ""Yes."" We received the bill and first, we had food on our bill when we only ordered drinks and the Coronas were priced at $5.50. I'm not one to fret about $1.50 but considering the waitress told us the wrong price I felt I needed to speak up. We asked her about it and she tried to pass it off as tax? Ummm no. She got the manager and he came over to inform us we read the page wrong, which we did, it was Coors not Corona. The manager should of just given us the special since the waitress told us wrong but he didn't seemed concerned about bad customer service.   Honestly I have some family coming in town next week and was planning on taking them here for dinner but now I have no desire to come back. Bad service all around on a non-bust night and being treated rudely by management and staff.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"First all- let me say- I love Husk brunch! We like to come sit at the bar, get Bloody Mary's and have delicious food.  We had not been for dinner at Husk in a long time with all the new restaurants everywhere (we are Nashville locals). So we wanted to check out what they were doing for summer dishes with all the great veggies in season now.   We had the Crab Rice, Catfish, and my husband had the steak.   Crab Rice was by far the best part of our meal with crispy pieces mixed in and good flavor- decomposed crab cake. It was pretty good. It was on top of a tomato jam- and I love all things tomato in the summer!   The catfish on the other hand was very bland. It had a Rice grits and zucchini with it that really didn't do much for me. I usually think of catfish with a bit of spice to it or expect Husk dishes to have some pizazz... and it wasn't there.  My husband's steak was severely undercooked based on how he ordered it. He likes his steak medium-well, and the steak he got was rare/ medium-rare at best- very red to the edge and bloody. The grilled okra was nothing to rave about. I make better at home.... again not much flavor. We brought the steak home and had steak and eggs this morning-- quality of meat is great.   A lackluster meal- unfortunate in the great dining experiences to be had around Nashville.  Overall- we will stick to brunch for Husk.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"So....For some reason my husband and I opted to eat here last night.  We hadn't been to a LJS in years.  For starters, there was some sort of power tool noise happening behind the line.  Because of this, it took a little bit longer than it should have for someone to realize we were there.  Once there, the young gentleman was friendly and took our order.  We ordered the family meal to split as both of us were pretty hungry.  Our order came out hot and fresh.  We ended up with a TON of onion rings.  Man oh man.  There were enough onion rings to feed a small army.  Our fish and chicken were the typical Long John's fare.  We took our cole slaw with us as we couldn't finish our meal.  Everything was super greasy.  That is to be expected here though.  It was okay.  The sound of the power tool continued during the entire time we ate there.  It was really loud and annoying.  The young people behind the counter also apparently became bored and started to horse around.

"If you want to have authentic Japanese food, then you may skip Mizu.   We ordered ramen, and the ramen turned out to be, most likely, made from instant noodles. I traveled to Japan frequently and have had real Japanese ramen for at least a couple of dozen times. I also frequented Japanese restaurants in the US a lot (in Boston, New York, San Fransisco, SoCal and other restaurants in St. Louis.) Never have had a ramen tasted like this one. The texture is not at all al dente but rather way too soft, just like the instant noodles from Maruchan. The broth tasted like made from the seasoning packets of, again, Maruchan. The toppings are strange combination: cucumbers and other unidentifiable vegetables. It just tasted like something I could make in my kitchen, not from a restaurant. (And I'm a bad cook) It is not extremely bad, but I wouldn't spend a penny to eat that in a restaurant.   We also ordered other food from the menu: sushis, agedashi tofu, etc. None of them are close to Wasabi or Nobu's in St. Louis. The sushi rolls were wrapped in nori which seems too chewy (due to humidity??) to enjoy. The agedashi tofu is the biggest I've ever had, which make me unable to savor the crunchy outside and creamy inside at the same time.   The service is okay, but the food is beyond acceptable to an Asia-born, Asia-raised, Asian food lover. If you are okay with Americanized Asian food, nevertheless, it's probably still an option.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Stopped in yesterday for a very quick bite for lunch. All I wanted was a small or personal size pizza. I was the only one there, so it seemed like they weren't used to actually having customers inside; it's more of a pick up your pizza kind of place. (You could use actual napkin dispensers at the tables, by the way.)  So twice I was asked how I heard about E. Milano before I even ordered (it's not Emilano's). I said ""Yelp"", which was true. I was on my way to the airport to fly home but I wanted just a slice or so of pizza, and not a burger through a fast food window. I opened up my Yelp app and I was on the Donelson Pike and there it was.  So let me tell you: these guys have perfected a delicious small pizza, made to order, with rich, delicious tomato sauce, pepperoni slices crisp, and nice jalapeno slices that complemented the flavor. Nice and piping hot, and also full of flavor. Took them maybe 5-8 min to make it; took me just about that time to wolf it down. Fantastic! Now I know where to order pizza next time I'm in this wonderful city ---and wonderful too because each meal I had during my 3 day stay was superb all around.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I generally stay away from downtown ""name brand"" restaurants, because I'm generally always disappointed...but I decided to give Drago's a second chance. My first visit had been over 3 yrs ago, and I finally decided to give it another chance. My overall view of the place? Over rated. To me, it's A notch above Red Lobster. Most of the dishes are made with frozen seafood. I had the stuffed lobster tail that came out tough and cold, and the lobster meat said ""look for me!"" The charbroiled oysters are just ok- and the lobster Mac n cheese is about the best item on the menu.  The restaurant was PACKED, however. There was an hr wait when we went, but we avoided that by grabbing a table in the bar area, which is first come, first served. I actually like the ambiance of the bar itself, and the dirty martini was pretty decent.   All in all, this restaurant (in my opinion), is highly over priced and over rated.

Stopped in here last Saturday (7/28/18) afternoon with my 5 year old for lunch after passing this place too many times to count over the last few years, due to the location and parking situation. We opted to sit downstairs, which is order & pay upfront, self serve drinks, utensils, and seating, etc. Ordering was simple and it was nice to see the pizzas being made right there. The fountain drink selection is lacking, but I was able to make an Arnold Palmer, so that was good. The ambience was pleasant. The decor has a southern twist to it, along with country music playing, which I miss after moving back up here from NC a few years ago. What I didn't like was that all the tables were sticky and it didn't seem busy in there at all, which just tells me it was a lack of attention.   FOOD: I ordered the tater tot nachos (pic attached) that come with brisket, smoked cheese sauce, avocado cream, and pick de Gallo. I wanted to love this because I was craving comfort food with a twist, BUT the sweet potato tots were waaayy too sweet and didn't go with the rest of the dish at all, the cheese sauce wasn't all that warm and the texture was a little chalky, the pico was lacking in portion and flavor, and the brisket was only so-so. Overall, it wasn't the worst thing I've eaten, but definitely not close to my expectations.   My son had the kids chicken fingers and fries, which he really enjoyed. These seemed better than your average frozen fingers. His only complaint was the fries being too soggy.    I'm not sure if this was an off day or if we just picked the wrong food.

I opted for the pulled pork and at the recommendation of the woman who took my order, I added the sharp provolone and sautéed spinach. There was enough spinach for a salad. The meat was flavorful and very well prepared - and I enjoyed the combination of the provolone and the spinach. It was a big sandwich, but didn't make me feel overly stuffed.

"This is a review of an outdoor event that Velvet Cactus put on for Cinco de Mayo.  So, usually I don't like reviewing a place based on an event experience, but I had food and drinks here, so here we are. I was here last week for the Velvet Cactus Cinco de Mayo celebration. This is a 3 day out door party that consisted of food, drinks and different bands.  On the day I went, it was packed. The Molly Ringwalds were set to play and they had a huge stage set up in their parking lot. There were different booths where you could get food, margaritas, beer, and soft drinks. The main reason I wanted to review was because of how they handled the crowd. The place was PACKED and the staff got people through the lines quickly with barely any wait.  While I was here I tried the frozen margaritas and the pork tacos. The margarita was delicious and the tacos were outstanding! For $9 you got three tacos that were PACKED with delicious pork that was spiced perfectly. I had never really had any desire to go here, but after trying these tacos, I know I will be back for more.  Another thing that impressed me was how clean they kept the indoor bathrooms. I don't use port-o-lets if I can avoid it and the staff was cool with people coming in and using the restrooms inside. They stayed on top of keeping the area clean and stocked with everything you might need- it was great.

"We have been to Villaggio's about half dozen times and after eating there again last night I wanted to write a review.  They consistently provide a high quality meal with friendly service, reasonably priced. Besides the great food, one of my favorite things about this restaurant is the acoustics - you can actually speak to the person(s) you are dining with without yelling - it is a large place, tables rather close together (not my favorite thing), but somehow the noise level is tolerable.  I typically order the pappardelle bolognese and it is perfection - homemade pasta is simply the best.  Great place for a dinner out with friends or family.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Sad about this review. First off: the food was good. My wife got the breakfast burrito, I got a club with fried, and we both got some wine. It was Sunday at lunch time and they were busy, but not swarming. The problem was with the service. Took a very very long time. When it came out, I got the complete wrong sandwich and the wrong side. They replaced it after a bit, but then lagged in bringing me the requested condiments until I was half done. When the bill came out, I was surprised to see a sub charge for switching house made chips to house made fries. Sub charges are fine, I guess even though it was another dollar on top of a 12 dollar sandwich to change it from one type of fried potato to another type of fried potato. Anyway my gripe isn't with the charge alone, I was just taken aback that they included an extra charge when under similar circumstances, other restaurants would comp, discount, or offer something extra to make up for the poor service and incorrect order. Wish I didn't have a bad taste in my mouth because the place itself was nice and the food was good, but alas.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"So, we have been here several times since their opening on Gravois.  At first, we had good experiences and the food was delicious. The service, however, seems to be declining. We have brought several large groups of people to the restaurant to try the food. Unfortunately, the last two times, our server was horrible.  It happened to be the same server both times. They do add an automatic gratuity, which is reasonable if you have a large group, and we had 7 people. The female server must have known she would get her tip, and did not care.  One person was without their food while everyone else had been served. We literally had to ask another server to help us for additional drinks and for missing food. There is a male server at the restaurant who is much better. My husband is acquainted with the owner, so he got up from the table and talked with her about the poor service. He requested the check directly from her.  We really hope she does something about the quality of the service. I think everyone would have a much more enjoyable experience and not question the pricing if the service improved.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Christopher's, on most nights of the week, is the restaurant equivalent of spending 2 hours at the tot lot from hell while simultaneously flushing money down the toilet. In fact, if you asked for the 35 dollars in one dollar bills that it costs for 2 people to eat average-tasting food, you would probably enjoy yourself more by flushing them one by one.   Allow me to elaborate...  During my visit, my friend and I were squeezed at a deuce (a table for two, for those of you unfamiliar with restaurant terms) behind the hostess stand. Seated behind me was a man of such hefty girth that I was allotted approximately 2 inches of room to move around. Next to us was a proverbial zoo of kindergarden ages hellions who kept whacking their yellow balloons into our entrees. Also, because Christopher's is essentially one giant open room, every table's conversation echoed louder than ours and I had a hard time hearing what my friend was saying.   When the bacon cheeseburger that I ordered arrived, it took the waitress about 10 minutes to locate me some ketchup. My 9 dollar cheeseburger had essentially no flavor, even WITH the bacon, and instead of fries they gave me chips. This is dinner, people. I shouldn't have to pay an extra 2 dollars for a handful of fries on the DINNER menu. Lunch I could understand.   The only people that should ever spend money at Christophers and expect a relaxing time are the deaf, blind, extremely patient or those that themselves contribute to the zoo of children in the restaurant every night.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

I don't know where to begin the experience was negative right from the start,  the girl at the counter had the personality of a rock or even less than that.  I asked for the special and she had to ask me twice what sides I wanted.  we also got a second meal for our next door neighbor .  The service was fast however that was the only good thing .  The tortillas didn't even seem like they were cooked.  I have seen bigger pieces of chicken on cornish game hens and it was burnt.

"One sad thing for me when I lived in the mid-west for school was that it was impossible for me to get good Japanese food unless I was in Chicago.  Been here three times not because I wanted to come, but because my friends around this area loves this place.  I'd have to say that the food here sucks and it's expensive!  The hibachi steaks here are too damn salty and the ambience is nothing Japanese here.  Nobody in this restaurant even knew how to speak Japanese lol.  The owner comes to me and says, ""The food here is better than what you had in Japan right?"" Me being nice, I said yes, but inside I was dumbfounded that the owner seriously believed that this restaurant actually serves good Japanese food (all the workers here needs to take an road trip to Japan).

Very average food! So we thought we'd sample a new restaurant and were sorely disappointed. We ordered the pad Thai (pretty decent) and a curry. Firstly this is the only Thai restaurant I've been to that doesn't customize the spice level - you've got to take it like they've prepared it! Their service was decent but they have a mandatory 20% tip. Overall I'm surprised this restaurant has survived in Delmar which is famous for its international cuisine.

"The white sauce is not vegan-friendly  I ordered The Halal Guys through Grub Hub. My food came fairly quick which was nice. I order the regular Falafel Platter with extra sauce and the small Falafel platter. I have eaten the Falafel platter so I was familiar with the taste. I have always ordered but never gone into their establishment so I do not know how their customer service is. I was disappointed to learn that their white sauce is made with egg so I had to pass on it. The red sauce which is hot sauce is very hot for my taste. I enjoy eating their falafel, my only complaint about the falafel is that is a little on the tough side to break into. I feel it was also kind of pricey for a small platter. I did not take pictures of my photos to show the size difference between the small and regular. It is a big difference with the small having 4 falafels while the regular came with five.  While, I enjoyed my meal I was saddened to learn about the white sauce because the platters sauce I feel help make the dish moist and not just rice, lettuce, tomato, and falafel and the red sauce is extremely hot to me. I am not sure I would order again from Halal Guys but I would not discourage others from ordering there if they were not vegan. Also I am concerned about people saying the pita in the store is next to the meat",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I ventured into Pie in the Sky as it was recommended by the hotel staff and within walking distance of my stay.  While the expression ""Pie in the Sky"" may refer to heavenly things...one thing is for sure is that the prices for pies here are through the roof.    Atmosphere - Modern, clean, black, neon-purple, concrete, busy, dim, night club-ish, friendly  Food - I did not eat in the establishment as I walked in and placed my order to go.  Upon reviewing their menu, I noted that they have a lot of choices and that you are probably better served, value wise, if you order a specialty pizza.  As I was not in the mood for something too crazy, I opted to create my own.  I ordered a small (traditional crust) with pepperoni and kalamata olives (see pic).  I was excited that they had this option as I think the kalamata olive is the Best on pizza.  When I arrived back to the hotel, the pizza was still nice and hot.  While being a small, the slices were decent.  The sauce had a good, slightly spicy flavor and, despite other reviewer comments, mine had the appropriate amount.  The dough and crust were great.  It was soft, yet crispy in the right areas with the correct amount of oiliness from the pepperoni.  You could tell they use quality ingredients in their pies.        Service - The girl at the counter/ register / hostess area was great.  She was cheerful, helpful, and added to the interaction.      Price - Here is where you come down to earth.  A small with two toppings came to $11.97+tax...ouch!  It all just seemed a few bucks too high.  I recently went to the city of Charlotte's version of Pie and their two topping 10' pizza was just $8.95 on their menu.  See, I am not crazy.

As with all Indian food buffets, a) the food tends to be very rich & heavy and, b) I tend to eat too much of it. But with Coriander, the food is actually good so you do thoroughly enjoy the process of over eating.  I've been here a few times and they change up the menu, which I like. They don't go over the top with different options, but they usually have few very good vegetable and meat dishes and with one or two desserts. Also, instead of just stacking a bunch of naans, they'll get you your own basket fresh out of the tandoor.  I highly recommend if you're looking for a lunch spot whilst in SJ.

"Wow, tough to make a decision about this place based on the Yelp reviews.  They're all over the board from 1 to 5 stars.  (Spoiler alert:  This is not a 4 or 5 star restaurant)  I had a server at the Capital Grille in Houston recommend it to me for the crab cakes & BBQ shrimp so I went.  First thing you'll notice is the line down the street to get in.  However, if you'll eat at the bar you can bypass the line.  I did.  Abita Amber 16 oz. draft for $4.50 served by Meghan.  Really nice server, thumbs up, personable & attentive.  Decent price for a beer on Bourbon Street.  The crab cake appetizer is two crab cakes topped with a spicy sauce & some crawfish tails.  It literally took 2 minutes from order until it showed up in front of me.  I thought it was tasty, the spicy sauce gave it good flavor.  It was warm, not hot, and I'd say the sauce helped cover the fact there was a fair amount of filler besides crab in the cake.  However, I'll give this dish between 2 & 3 stars.  If it had been served hot & fresh it'd be 3 stars.  The BBQ shrimp appetizer is 5 large shrimp.  That's a fair enough deal for the price.  However, I put my finger in the sauce and if it was 90 degrees I'd be surprised.  I've had warmer baths than the BBQ sauce.  The bread served with the shrimp is totally bland.  They took a baguette & sliced it a few hours ago.  Not heated, buttered, seasoned or anything.  Dried out, white baguette.  I peeled the shrimp & this is where it gets bad.  The shrimp were so overcooked you had to fight to get the shell off.  Literally every segment of the tail shell had to be peeled off the shrimp.  You should be able to pinch the tail of a properly cooked shrimp & have it pop out of the last two segments.  You couldn't pinch the tail and get the meat to pop out of the fan at the very back.  In short, horribly overcooked & very difficult to peel.  The flavor?  One overpowering note - Worcestershire.  BBQ shrimp sauce should be a blend of butter, Worcestershire & spices.  This dish was 1 star, had it been served hot I'd have given it 2 stars & if the shrimp had been perfectly cooked it might have gotten to 3 stars.  The ambience of the restaurant is totally touristy.  People lined down the street to get in, setting at the bar looking around I didn't see a lot to convince me that it was particularly clean.  It looked like it needed a good scrubbing.  I liked my server; she was good.  I saw several managers doing actual work & they checked in on me twice to make sure I was doing ok.  The service was good from server to management.  My conclusion?  I don't see why anyone would wait in line to eat here.  The BBQ shrimp at Deanie's are much better.  Then again, this is a restaurant at the corner of Bourbon Street & Conti Street in the heart of the tourist trap Bourbon Street.  I should have known better.  It's not awful but it's a long way from special.  If you've come to New Orleans looking for spectacular food this isn't the place.

"Gourmet pizza has finally found its way to east Tucson.  Dry River is a sleek and laid back little pizza joint. A brick oven stares you in the eye from the center of the restaurant as soon as you walk in the front door. A couple of televisions are in the bar, basketball is the sport of choice. And a can of Four Loko peeks out from the top liquor shelf?  The tap list is short but tasteful. Don't miss out on the Isolation Ale from O'Dell while they still have it. It's my favorite winter seasonal brew.  To begin, I chomped down some of the potato, bacon and cheddar pierogi. The little buttery, tender dumplings were served with caramelized onions, topped with sea salt and fresh-a pepper. This Polish dish is out of place on the menu, but I won't object to having these addictive comfort food niblets available.  I ordered the tomatillo pizza with chicken, caramelized onions, cheddar and jack cheese. The pizzas here are made Neapolitan style, so they have a thin crisp crust. The tangy tomatillo sauce balanced out the rich cheeses, while the sweetness of the onions rounded it out.  The restaurant uses counter service, but the staff is both professional and hospitable. Young ladies keep an eye on your plates. Guys in the bar that would fit Archer's visual description of an anthropology student are always there to answer your questions.

Although they offered to seat us (all customers after us were turned away... Even with reservations) we declined to pay the prefix for no entree options. We will never go back! Please ignore the previous reviews when managed under the original owners. Those great aspects of this place no longer apply.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Who can go wrong with such an adorable name? That's at least what I thought when diving into the special of the day, the Creme brûlée stuffed French toast. Sounds amazing, right?  It was good, don't get me wrong, but it didn't blow my mind like I thought it would. And I've decided why. I think it would have done much better with a brioche bread. I just wasn't digging the baguette. It didn't absorb the egg and flavors that I barely tasted. It wasn't horrible, it just could have been so so much better.  What was amazing was my double mimosa.

"Visiting from out of state and decided to do take out.  So we were looking for a great tavern burger. This is not the place! We ordered three different burgers and that came with fries.  2 of the burgers were supposed to be cooked medium and 1 well done. All three were well done over salted, not lightly salted but salt poured all over it drowning out any seasoning that was on the burgers! The buns were all burnt! Yuk!! The home made fries were also salty, but not as bad as the burgers, but the fries were soggy and not good many over cooked. Sad to say the food went in the trash. Wendy's would have been a much better choice.  Such a shame, we were looking for a great pub burger and not the kind of crap we got.

Unfortunately customers have their masks off and are talking &talking and coughing .  The only place that was not available for sitting was at the waiting area in front of the hostess stand , which is nice to keep them safe.  So it was a full house tonight even though I came in at five which is usually pretty early to eat, the place was packed and ready for a hockey game and that's probably why there were so many people in the restaurant.

"Meh. Looked up Chinese because we wanted something new and this place came up, close and had top reviews.   The space they have in the shopping plaza isn't all that big for dine-in but I tell you what would help.....a little color. That place looks like a prison cafeteria. All white, dated, dirty, paper placemats and plastic cups.   We decided to not dine-in  We tried a few different things. Paper wrapped chix for an app, I got small egg flower soup, he tried the won ton. He got the Mongolian Beef entree, I got Pork egg foo young.   Egg flower soup  only reason? They put corn in it. Corn? That's all I tasted was canned corn.   Won ton soup, he said kind of bland but ok.   Paper wrapped chix  where's the meat? I get more protein from my eggs.   Pork egg foo young... this was GOOD. Good amount of pork, not too many onions and the egg itself was made poofy not flat omelet  style. That was appealing.   Mongolian beef  had heat but was lacking sauciness? Other places the beef has like a caramelized sauce on it, this didn't. Had heat but lacked actual flavor. Steamed rice with it was old. Ewww.   Overall, I will NEVER dine-in this place but I will give the food another shot as we are fans of chow mein (which did get high remarks) and fried rice. I'd like to try a few other apps too.

"Best things about this place are the toilet seats and ambiance. The toilet seats are heated and are Japanese luxury seats with duvets and such. Service was slow. The table wasn't greeted until maybe 15 minutes later, & I asked where our server was. Server seemed annoyed by me when I would ask for something. Guess I was deemed needy, but she was away for long periods at a time. I added lobster tails to our dinner for $10 each. They were the size of a shriveled shrimp. I guess I got what I paid for, but I can get a full lobster tail somewhere else for like $25. The NYE dinner was alright. Wouldn't pay $85 a person here again though. Wagyu wasn't that great, & dessert was just a bunch of mochi that I didn't care for. Serving sizes are tapa sized portions. Even for the entree. My boyfriend was still hungry so I ordered a pizza from Gino's East to be delivered to the house when we left here. I'd go back here for drinks and the fancy toilet seats, but that might just be it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The biggest red flag for us was when we were boxing up our food; the server dropped the container tops on the floor, putting them right back on our table. We highly suspect this place does NOT use sanitary best practices. Apparently, the health department already had to close this place due to an infestation and lack of cleanliness!! Wish we saw this before we went.   The food was also not impressive. I got a veggie curry, asking if the vegetables in it were freshly cut and not frozen. She lied. They were definitely frozen.  I won't bother describing the rest of the food - bland. I've been eating authentic Indian for many years, and the food here tastes as though it came from a jar and was heated up.  The service was also just generally poor. She didn't bother to check on us while we ate, or ask if we wanted our check....and thought dropping food containers on the floor was ok.

Sbraga caught my eye not just because the food and setting looked great but also the price for four courses seemed really reasonable ($55). We had a table of four and had booked the week before but got in no problem for a Saturday night. We were seated straight away and looked after superbly, the staff were attentive without overbearing and gave us a thorough run through of the menu.

The waitress we had our last time was there again and as usual doing nothing besides chatting with patrons at the bar and stuffing her mouth with food, while occasionally refilling a drink. Luckily we had a different waitress who was good, unfortunately she was picking up the load for the other waitress who must be the owners relative, because if she worked for me she would be fired. Ok now on to the food, sandwiches are smaller and less meat. My counterpart had a wrap and it was falling apart. The buffalo waffle fries/chips were about half the size they use to be. The condiments that use to be on the table, peppers, extra horseradish, etc are now all gone and you have to request if you want something extra.

"Ooof.  Came in this past Friday at about 5:45 to get dinner before a show at Bridgestone.  There was only one other table plus a few folks at the bar, so we assumed getting dinner in a timely fashion wouldn't be an issue.  When the server was taking our order, he mentioned that they had a new menu.  My friend ordered a steak salad and I ordered a burger.  About 10-15 minutes later, her salad came out, and the server asked us if we had ordered anything else.  Ummm, MY food?  He got flustered, made another comment about the new menu, and said he would go find out.  For the next 20 minutes, he walked in and out of the kitchen, but didn't come over to update me on the status of my food.  I had to get up and go ask him, and he said it would be another few minutes.  He babbled about the stupid new menu again and said it wasn't sent through to the kitchen.  Great whatever.  Please get me my food.  The burger finally came out, about 25 minutes after my friend's salad.  When the check came, another mention of the new menu.  The burger was delicious, which is the only reason they're getting 2 stars.  I worked in the service industry for a very long time.  I understand that mistakes happen.  But COMMUNICATE with the hangry customer who is watching their friend eat.  The fact that he didn't come back over to update me was infuriating.  You can lie to me, blame it on the kitchen, I don't care, I'm not going to go in there to check.  Acknowledge the issue instead of ignoring it.  If there was a new menu, maybe being proactive about making sure that orders are transmitting properly to the kitchen would go a long way, especially when the restaurant is approximately 4% full.  No sort of money was taken off our bill, nor were we offered any kind of compensation.  The staff needs to get their act together.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I walked in hoping to get a teriyaki chicken meal to go (like from the gazillion teriyaki spots in the Pacific Northwest).  No luck.  I finally decided on chicken yakisoba -- noodles, chicken, veggies all mixed up with tangy sauce.  I opted to add bean sprouts for a bit extra.  I took it to go and the package weighed a good four pounds.    It was just okay.  The flavor was decent, but overall, I was disappointed because first, the meal is 95% noodles -- no nutrition in that.  Then, with the noodles being so prevalent, the chicken was cut too small to see or easily capture.  But, worse than that, there were so few ""veggies.""  A few bits of bell peppers, exactly two strips of what was supposed to be cabbage, a couple strips of onions, several tiny carrot strips -- and that's it.  No broc, no zuch, and worst of all, I didn't receive the bean sprouts that I specifically asked and paid for.  I picked out the chicken and veggies and had a couple bites of noodles and still have nearly four pounds of noodles left that I don't want.    I had about 15 minutes to peruse the menu while waiting for the noodles.  They have a ton of sushi and other foods that I'm not adventurous enough to try.  Most of the prices seem fair -- the noodles were $8.50 (with tip) out the door.  It's very nice inside -- not fancy nice, but casual nice.  Full bar.  Pleasant employees.

"Not too shabby... definitely a lot of food and a decent place to get a steak. Came here tonight to get my Fat Tuesday fix... and yes - I definitely feel fat afterwards =P  (1) Started with Oyster Shooters - not too bad... but it seemed like there was a bit too much in that little shot glass to take down comfortably. My buddy liked 'em though.  (2) ""Bar Prawns"" - I was expecting some jumbo cocktail shrimp, but these were fried. Pretty damn good for being fried, though. I liked the cocktail sauce (surprising 'cause I usually don't) 'cause they added a bit of horseradish in it. The tarter sauce was pretty good, too.  (3) Porterhouse w/ Onion Rings - also came with salad and a roll. I'd say the salad was so-so (looked like something out of a bag) - but the sunflower seeds were a plus.   The onion rings were AMAAAZING. Crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside. MMmmMMMm... and the porterhouse, definitely a nice hunk of meat. I ordered it medium-rare and it came out just right - maybe a bit more rare than medium, but I liked it. Definitely a good replacement for the Prime Rib that ran out =/ haha  Other plusses - Great service! We never had an empty water glass and the server was checking in just enough for drinks and all.   The minuses - No cracked pepper - none for the salad and (more disappointing) none for the steak. Sad day...   Overall... I'd give it a mid to high 3 sort of rating.

"""This isn't really a bar. It's more of a restaurant with a bar."" - our super awesome waiter who was also the bartender. That's exactly what it is. You can tell the food is a priority from the taste...  Our waiter had a great personality, which made this an even better experience.  They made a Patron margarita for us that wasn't on the menu ($11), and it was super potent. There had to be at least 2-3oz of tequila in it! The German beers were a little expensive ($6-7 for 10oz of the good ones I would've wanted, but they had others that were regularly priced for a pint that I wasn't interested in, the heffeweizen and the bock). They have rotating beers of the day (and I think cocktails and whatnot of the day), too.  We had the kielbasa dip as a starter, and it was great. It was cheesy (maybe cream cheese?). I loved it. The grilled bread wasn't burnt, like I've had elsewhere. I personally had the ""three onion soup"" (their take on French onion soup, but I guess that would be frowned upon, since they make German food). That was great as well.   We shared the wurst/sausage platter and the pork schnitzel. Everything was amazing, but each of the plates could probably be split between two people. I honestly think the sausage was better than both German restaurants I've been to in Philly...   The plates are HUGE! You could split one plate or the wurst platter between two people. Trust me when I say this, but you'll only need to order half the amount of dishes you usually order (because they're twice the size)... unless you brought the Rock or the Hulk with you...  I know everyone thinks ""there's no good food in the suburbs,"" but this is the equivalent of a ""great city restaurant.""",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
Horrible food. I wanted grits and eggs. It was water. I was told it is normal. I asked for extra olives and was told I put one extra olive in my bloody Marie. My meal had no flavor and the worst grits I have ever had. The waitress discounted $1.40 off a 75 dollar meal. Will never go back EVER!!!!!!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

They have the best fresh burgers but the fries are terrible when they serve you just the bits and pieces.

It was a cold day and I was excited to see Clear Sky's take on it - mistake. It needs to be removed from the menu. The ramen can only be described as an abomination. The broth was flavorless water, and their spin on the vegetable additions tasted like eating coleslaw in a bowl. The fried egg in EACH of the three ramens our table was over cooked and did not have runny yolk.

"A truly resplendent dining experience. I think the Petruce Brothers have absolutely nailed it here, and have been three times in a month. The plates are so thoughtfully constructed. My one tip is to make sure to get a fork/spoonful of each piece of a plate to get the full experience. Every dish seems to offer a triplet of textures (creamy, crunchy, chewy, etc.) and a triplet of flavors (sweet, savory, sour) but you have to make sure to get it all together. The food based around a simple wood fired grill somehow ends up totally surprising as you go from dish to dish. I'll be bold and say this is my favorite restaurant in Philly.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Being from the D.C. area I've become slightly accustomed to exceptional service at nicer restaurants, that being said when I make a reservation I don't expect hosts to hand me a buzzer (that everyone without a reservation touched) until my table is ready. It should be ready upon arrival, hence reservation!!!!  However, the restaurant in itself is beautiful!  Our waitress Samantha was very young and struggled to open our wine bottle. She was super sweet though so it wasn't really an issue. We also noticed other waiters struggling to open bottles as well so it seems to be management and training issue versus a staff issue. Definitely no fault of Samantha's. Although she did forget to bring out the chiller until we had practically finished the bottle.  The food also took a while to come out, again no fault to Samantha because when we received it, it was hot. I ordered the Chilean sea bass, it was not good compared to Joes Seafood in DC where I originally started ordering the dish. It needed more sauce and to be cooked a little longer to form a crispier texture to the outside. The quinoa and mixed vegetables were delicious!!!  I also order their French pressed coffee which was exceptional!!!  Personally I wouldn't go back but I can see how it would be recommended is such a small, rural area with no other fine dining.  ALSO I was told that it was ""fine dining"" so I wore a dress and Louboutin's, and surrounded by men in t shirts and flip flops. Personally I don't want to see a mans feet unless I'm at a Friday's or McDonalds. So they should enforce a dress code to be considered ""fine dining"".",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"2.8  We have been spoiled in the Bay Area. This place looked adorable from the curb, and was close-by to the Sheraton for a nice evening stroll. But, for us, the place looked better than the food tasted.  Cute and charming, small space, but done warmly, and well.  Ordered agedashi tofu and 2 specialty rolls that averaged about $15 each. Believe the names were island and double spicy tuna roll. Rice not fluffy enough and the pieces were sliced unevenly. Overall taste was just average for the price charged. As well, agedashi tofu could have held much more flavor, and had a more delicate fry and fluffiness to the protein.  Don't think we would come back for another visit, cuz we are here for a bit. For $40, just a bit disappointed overall in the quality of the food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"1 star doesn't even cut it. It has been 3 times I have been here for the good food that the service was terrible. Today, my family and I went at about 45 minutes before closing time and our server barely acknowledged us. About half way through our dinner, the staff started to clean the restaurant up. Normally it would be okay to simply sweep the floors or wipe off tables, but when the staff is yelling across the restaurant, moving tables around and pretending we weren't even there, that's where I have a problem. As we were leaving, we walked by probably all of the staff, and only one buser said goodbye. OUT OF ALMOST 20 PEOPLE! My daughter tried to push the door open, but couldn't. Hm. I wonder why? Maybe because we were locked in! Previous visits to this restaurant weren't very friendly either. About 3 months ago, we were with this male server and he should NOT be in the restaurant business. We never complain about servers or waiters, but this night we yelled about this man to the manager. Believe it or not, he still works there to this day, yelling across the restaurant about a party he was going to later that night.

"Terrible experience, don't waste your money or time. We visited Loui's wine and Dive on a Wednesday night and the service was great however the food was awful, yuck. I ordered the Fish and Chips and the fries were stone cold, told the waiter and he promptly ordered me a fresh batch which was warm. The Fish was lukewarm, certainly not as hot as it should have been. My wife ordered the Tuscan Roasted Chicken with a side of Patatas Bravas and it was also Luke warm, additionally the cauliflower the toasted cauliflower on the chicken was essentially non existent, as it consisted of tiny tiny crumbles of cauliflower.  After all this we decided to sweeten it up a bit and ordered the Apple crumble, terrible mistake. Our night was about to go from bad to terrible. Upon arrival of the apple ""crumble"", a dish that could best be described as a soup from hell landed on our table. There were zero crumbs on this ""dish"", instead there was some liquid with a scoop of ice cream floating in the middle of it. The Dish was served in a cast iron which we thought was weird, upon tasting the dessert  we realized the ""chef"" had probably perhaps mistaken the sugar for the salt.... this thing was as salty as tasting sea water, it was disgusting. What a terrible experience, get it together or get out of Mass Avenue Louie. Never again.  All that said our server was great and took care of the nastiness that was that dessert and the cold fries by comping both of those dishes from the bill.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Decent Thai food and charming little spot -- but one of the strangest experiences I've ever had with a server. The waittress simply walked away right in the middle of taking our order -- actually mid-sentence. I thought she had something pressing -- like a fire in the kitchen. That would've been understandable. I then realized she was simply in outer-space; checked-out.  There was one other couple in the restaurant. It sounded like the same waittress was trying to sell them something (like Avon products?) and this occupied 90% of her time while we were eating dinner. Pretty good food. Absent service.

"Three stars for their handling our group of 100+ very well. First, this place is kind of built for that, what with a huge open room with a bar and space for a buffet. So for our group it was roomy, plenty of tables. It is a nice space. The bar in that part of the restaurant is not huge but the service was very attentive and fast. Again, they seem really oriented to the group thing.  The food buffet was decent. I will say I was not expecting much as it was a buffet in a place for groups (and apparently otherwise tourists not seeking the better joints), so they actually surpassed my expectations.  They had live music and room to dance and that was nice.   So I cannot judge based on sitting down for dinner, but for a business event was absolutely fine.

This was not the case, The plate cost more than the entrees and the catfish isn't even offered as a entrée . I was kinda surprised when my food came out in three small bowls and not a plate of food. The waitress told me after my food came out that if I had wanted a plat of jambalaya that I had to order it as a entrée and not as a PLATE. The menu doesn't show this anywhere.

"It was a Sunday and I wanted to try somewhere new, so I checked my Excel spreadsheet (yes I have one) of places to try in the Tampa Bay area. Pane Rustica got great reviews and I've heard a lot about it, so off I went!  We came into the restaurant -- which, by the way, is WAY bigger than it looks on the outside -- and one of the employees gave us the rundown of what the ordering/seating process was like. You stand in line, check out the menu and then give your order to the cashier THEN you go find a seat. I don't think I have been to a place with this seating concept before, but maybe I have and I just can't remember.   Anyway.  I ordered the special burger of the day and asked for it rare with a warm center. My boyfriend, feeling far more adventurous than I, ordered the ""shut up and eat."" We snagged a small table and waited for our food.   My burger came out and it was overdone. Well done, actually. So unfortunately I had to send it back. Burgers are probably my favorite food so I want them cooked correctly. I was kind of mad that it came out so well done. Then I checked the receipt and the cashier put medium rare instead of rare, which was sort of irritating because that's not what I asked for.   Nobody came by to refill our water either, so I was pretty thirsty throughout the whole meal. So...service was really disappointing. I know they were busy, but I felt kind of ignored.  When my burger did come back out, it was pretty good. It had pepperjack cheese and some avocado aioli (not good, at all, no flavor whatsoever). It wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but the menu changes daily so I would probably go back to try another one.   My boyfriend's meal ended up being some kind of Asian shrimp pasta, which was very good, though small. There were only two pieces of shrimp, which is kind of weak for $14.   I did leave the restaurant still feeling a little hungry since all I got for a side was fruit and there were not that many pieces of fruit for the side. My boyfriend echoed the same sentiment.   The things that looked the best were the pizza and the other sandwiches. There was a chicken salad sandwich that I wanted to dive right into, but duh I wouldn't be rude and grab some random person's plate and start eating their food.   I will probably go back to try some of their other items, especially their flatbread pizza and the different burgers they offer. For a first visit, it was okay.

I was excited to try Ciccio Cali after hearing a lot of hype from it. Sadly, I wasn't overly impressed with Ciccio Cali in St. Pete. Food was decent, nothing with a wow factor. I got the Thai bowl with shrimp, and my friend ordered the olé tuna poke. I appreciated that I got a good amount of shrimp in my bowl, but was disappointed that my carrots were completely undercooked. For the portion and quality, I feel that the bowls are a little over priced, but I expect that for a trendy restaurant in St. Pete, and a restaurant of CRG. I would say their higher-side prices are worth it at their Tampa restaurants, but Ciccio Cali missed the mark for me. They are definitely going for the trend of ""healthy bowls"" which makes up the majority of their menu and I could see this being a ""crowd-pleaser"" place to grab a bite with friends - but it was really nothing special. $15 for a small bowl and a drink- not worth it to me. Plates are hard plastic and give a cheap feel. Decor was also boring and felt that no effort or thought was put into it. I wanted to love this place, really- but I just didn't.

"Time for an update...I was really surprised to see Carmelitas down to 3 stars, until we stopped tonight. Hopefully, Jose, the manager reads this and makes some changes before they have no business at all.  This has been a twice a month stop for the last two years.  Although we have seen service slip a bit over the last six months, I thought it was just a bad spell.  But it has gotten so bad, I'm not going to waste my money here despite the decent food.  Service is slow, but on a Wednesday night with two guests in the restaurant it shouldn't have been this bad.  While our server sat at a table in the other section we waited and waited and waited and waited.  She was more interested in watching TV and drinking soda, she truly neglected her job.  We observed a gentleman come in and be seated.. He waited nearly ten minutes by himself.  The rude server told him that he could not get the fajita special for some reason...but that he could pay full price.  As he got up to walk out, he commented that he understands why there were only two people in at dinner time.  He will probably never return, over what?? a $2 difference??  Dinner was ok...I asked for raw onions on my taco salad...apparently that is an extra...50 cents extra for 6 to 8 small pieces of onion...and there was no lettuce in the salad.  Dinner was still tasty Carmelitas style which is why they get the two stars.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The service is great. The servers are really professional, nice. The ambiance is clean and kitschy/modern. The restaurant is so big that my boyfriend and I were joking that people could throw a wedding in there, like, the wedding AND the reception. It's huge! So many tables- too many tables!  The food was bland and not the least bit memorable. Almost dumbed down for a non-adventurous palette, who has either never been to Thailand or just wants more western-style Thai dishes.   Both my boyfriend and i were very disappointed with the food.   The prices were also really high in relation to the quality and quantity of the food. Really NOT worth it at all. The food was sub-par, a few notches below mediocre. Not really Thai at all.   Two stars for the great service. Unfortunately i came for the food first, service-second; and the food was a huge disappointment.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"My wife and I + 2 younger kids stopped in for a Friday night out.  We arrived after 8 pm and we were among 3-4 other groups there.  It took us a while to get the kids settled but our server was understanding and didn't rush us to order.  I had the lasagna which reminded me of some of the ones I had in Europe, less of a tomato slurry and heavier on the meat sauce, all of which was delicious.  My wife had the pesto pasta and added chicken, which was not on the menu but was handled without any hesitation.  I don't know if I hadn't asked, if I would have gotten any, but when I did manage to sneak my fork over and taste it, it too was excellent.  Prices are in line with what I expected but the food quality was great.  We most certainly will be back and would recommend.  As noted on their menu they are a Northern Italian fare, so I did notice there was NO Pizza on the menu, I just mention that in case that is what someone would be expecting/craving.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Carlito's Way or the Highway? Take the highway! Our plans did not include coming here, but several places we thought of going to were inexplicably closed. This place is laughably bad, given that it is SO overpriced and so tasteless. I could easily stumble upon ANY Mexican restaurant in my hometown and they would all have better tasting food than this place. Yes, this includes Del Taco and even Taco Bell. A Taco Bell soft taco would kick this place's ass, like Nunes vs. Rousey kick ass. It makes me wonder if ANYONE is Santa Barbara knows what good Mexican food should taste like.  Anyways, the specifics...I guarantee you that they just pour the beans out of a can on the combo plates. For $18 a plate you could do more than that. The cheese enchilada was covered in random crap to make up for the fact that the cheese was this gross, inauthentic off-white tasteless cheese. As someone else said, they overcompensate by putting Mexican flags in their ""food."" The beef taco, was yes, a beef taco. No more, no less. For that price, it better be the tastiest god damn beef taco I've ever had.  It's so easy to get good or great Mexican food for half the price of this crap. I hope that Santa Barbara has better to offer than this place, for the sake of the Republic. If they don't, California should kick them out!

"We called in our order last night and were told that they had a rush and therefore the wait time would be 41 minutes.  That was a bummer, but they were upfront about it and I can appreciate that.  We arrived 41 minutes after calling, and paid for our order.  The guy assisting us looked on the shelf for our order and not finding it, went into the back to see if the cooks were working on it.  It didn't appear that he found our ticket, but said that our order was not ready yet.  My son and I sat down on the bench facing the registers to wait.  After 14 minutes, my son asked if our order was ready yet.  The gentleman seemed surprised and had apparently forgotten that we were sitting there.  He disappeared into the back again, going down the line checking tickets.  It was apparent this time that he did not see our order.  He began whispering to the other employee who was running the other register.  She said to keep helping other customers.  After the line had dissipated, I got up and asked about our order again.  By this time, it was 26 minutes after the time that it should've been completed.  He apologized for the inconvenience but could not yell me when it would be done, and when I asked if they had lost the ticket, he avoided eye contact and appeared to be looking for the other employee for assistance.  We left with no food, having paid for our order.  I will never go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Plus three of the four of us sampled a variety of beers from the tap. The drink menu was just as inspiring as the food menu! Our table of four sampled quite a bit from the menu, and everything was simply fantastic. The brick chicken was probably everyone's favorite! We actually did have one plate that was not great, and the head chef, Tony, made it right. He brought out another steak for my husband, and it was incredible, and in line with the quality of everything else.

"My family has been coming here since 2013 when we bought a house nearby. It is an almost weekly event to go for kids eat free mixed with $5 wings with my daughter. Sometimes the wings are amazing but on these days they can't keep up with the volume.   Throughout the COVID 19 pandemic we have continued support when they started takeout and tipped full price. They were very conscientious with spacing, etc. This week they opened up outside seating and with a five year old we still didn't feel comfortable and ordered take out on Wing night. They didn't tell us until we picked up the food that they weren't honoring their specials for takeout anymore.

"Unfortunately, pagoda will no longer be receiving my business. I really did like this place a lot after moving to old city and got take out at least once a week.   New Year's Eve my friends and I ordered food for delivery. 2 hours later, no word from them at all and no one picked up the phone when I called. I get it, it's a super busy night of the year. Decided to walk over and pick it up - they hadn't even started the order. A warning or heads up about the wait would have been appreciated. They did give us a discount after I insisted, so I'll let this one slide.   The food. Anything with shrimp, they're never deveined. Really started to gross me out, especially in the dumplings when you can't really see what you're eating unless you open up and investigate.

"Never been to this location, which is huge on why I left such a poor review (which I hat doing, but hopefully this can be constructive). I've been to many Scottys locations in the past, where I know the majority have closed. We went here before a Butler show, hoping to get a quick bite to eat and a drink.   We were seated at 7. We ordered drinks and apps all at the same time, as we knew we were on a time crunch.   It took rather long to get our drinks (3/4 were draft beer from the tap and 1 mixed cocktail). It probably took every bit of 15 mins to get our drinks.   We ordered ONLY appetizers, as we wanted something quick. We ordered 2 orders of the buffalo chicken dip, the garlic bread knots, and a chicken wrap. Knowing that the bread wouldn't take long, nor would warming up chicken dip (which, let's face it, we all know that is what they do). The wrap only had a small about of cooked chicken, which again wouldn't take long.  By the time 30 mins rolled around that we were waiting on what we thought was relatively quick food to prepare, we began searching for our waitress. Our waitress, along with all other wait staff were not in the restaurant. We couldn't find anyone to check on our food. We went up to the bartender as a last resort to figure out what was going on, to tab out for our drinks only, and to tell them to forget about the food, as we are now going on 40 mins. We wouldn't be able to eat if it took any longer really, due to the specific start time of the show.   By this point, you can see our apps coming out to our table, 40 mins after ordering. We figured if it was already out, we could eat a few bites quickly and leave... however, all of our food was not even hot and I wouldn't even say it was warm. You could definitely tell it had been sitting out waiting to be picked up by our waitress, that was no where to be found. The dip was not as any of us remembered, tasted like melted cheese-wiz and barely any chicken. The garlic knots were as good as cold bread would be. The wrap seemed to be the only thing that was decent.   The restaurant wasn't even packed. We didn't understand how this could happen because they weren't busy.   The bartender ended up coming over and talking to us again, after we went to him originally with our concerns. He ended up comp'ing our meal, which was nice of him to do, but we were left really unsatisfied.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I came here last night after seeing a lot of great Yelp reviews, and it actually was really good! We ordered a bunch of slices and a calzone & everything was really satisfying. Regarding the ""giant"" slices, however: these didn't really look like a normal slice of pizza scaled up to be jumbo, rather just a very elongated, somewhat skinny slice of pizza. The ""giant"" slices are cut from a 28"" pizza, so they are pretty big, but mostly just long. The slices were kind of annoyingly long that you couldn't really pick up the pizza without it flopping all over, so you had to slide the pizza off of the tray into your mouth. And the tray they serve each slice on is the size of a full-size pizza tray, so if you order more than 3 slices at your table, the table isn't large enough to accommodate all of the slices. While nitpick-y, these minor annoyances affected the pizza-eating experience.  Complaints out of the way, let's get to the taste! You can order any toppings on individual slices which was nice. Just pick your toppings at the counter & it seems like they toss the toppings onto a slice of plain cheese, and top it with a little bit more cheese before reheating in the oven. The crust itself wasn't sturdy enough to support the entire slice, as previously mentioned, but had a nice flavor and wasn't too salty like some pizza dough can be. The calzone was the standout though! It was fully cooked through without any lingering wet dough & they put some sort of garlic butter spread on top so it tasted like a breadstick :) The topping to dough ratio was spot on as well! Overall the price you pay for each slice and the calzone is extremely reasonable. A good spot to stop in before the movies if you want a filling & relatively cheap meal that is also highly satisfying!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Last night I tried out South Howard's newest addition, Bar Asia. It was the soft opening so there were a few bumps throughout the service, but I will give them the benefit of the doubt and return once the full menu is offered.  The good: I loved my meal! I started off my meal with a glass of Italian Cabernet. It was a lighter Cabernet, very drinkable, and reasonably priced at $7 per glass. For an appetizer we selected the crispy spring rolls. The rolls were lightly fried and paired with a tangy fish sauce, cucumbers, and carrots. Once I saw several of the tacos were not yet available on the menu I decided on the Fresh Bowl with Shaking Beef and a sriracha aioli, served over vermicelli noodles. The bowl was huge and packed with flavor from the pickled onion, crushed peanuts, fresh cilantro, and crunchy vegetables.  The bad: I have a sinking feeling that the indoor/outdoor wraparound bar is going to make the restaurant miserably humid in the summer. The menu prices were all over the place ($4 tacos, $15 bowls, and $17 to $38 entrees). The sushi prices are on the high side, even by South Tampa standards. While the food was delicious I didn't feel like I was in a high-end restaurant and I think the restaurant is going to find that most diners are not looking to drop $50 for dinner in a bar like atmosphere.   I won't dock Bar Asia a star for offering a limited menu and no printed cocktail menu, but both of these issues need to be immediately addressed if they wish to be successful. I'll give Bar Asia another chance once they are running at full capacity. This restaurant has a lot of potential.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

This time we went and I made the mistake of saying that I wish they had better salsa to go along with the good food. Instead of taking 5 minutes for our order it took 30 minutes (and it wasn't busy), the food was burnt and I am now suffering the consequences of something 'added' to my food that has made me sick.

Since I prefer to pay cash, this leaves me stuck waiting 30 minutes or more for an order. The final straw for me was the cashier commenting on not getting a tip for a takeout order.

The spicy broth was layered with sesame flavors.  Fried shrimp app and spam musubi and Inari sushi were also delicious!  My son also says this is the definition of a Food Wars final food. High praise indeed.  Service was impeccable, everyone was so nice! Make the trip, wherever you are.  We are in Carpenteria and now that we've found this place will happily make the trip.

I ordered the St. Roch Seafood Pasta it was ok the shrimp was salad size shrimp and the noodles were very thin spaghetti noodles so it was a lot of sauce ans not enough pasta or meat.

"We've ordered from this place a couple different times. I usually try to order in time to get their lunch items because the price is very reasonable & we all know that any Chinese food place gives you way more food than you can eat in one sitting. I've tried probably a handful of different dishes on their menu and enjoyed all of them. (Sorry, can't remember exactly which dishes except for the veggie Lo Mein, which I love). Their food is not overly salty which is a nice change from some Chinese food.   All in all, the staff is friendly, delivery is prompt, prices are reasonable & most importantly, the food is good.

"The food is fine if you don't get the donuts, but the service in this place is awful particularly if you order to go.  I walk in and my drinks will be ready and 75% of my food order, but then you always have to wait unless you are a regular or an UberEats driver.  I just waited over 30 minutes for a single food item in a two item order as multiple people came in, ordered, and were served as I was continuously told they just had one more thing to grab for me.  My hot coffee is cold and my cold coffee watered down.  The other food is cold and all I got was a half hearted apology while they took care of regulars and UberEats orders out the door in front of me.    This was extremely frustrating.

"The idea of steak and lobster lured me to purchase the Living Social coupon.  I ordered the 2 lobster entree and was disappointed because it was flavorless.  Even the melted butter was watered down.  My partner ordered the combo, steak, lobster, and shrimp.  He loved his steak  but was also disappointed with the lobster.    Our entrees came with one side.  Mine was creamed spinach, yummy!  My partner's was loaded potato, very good!       Because the lobsters were flavorless our experience was so-so, but we would return to the restaurant again to try other menu items that sounded appetizing AND because the staff was very friendly and efficient.

"Stumbled across this place on Yelp a while back, but never had the chance to go. I'm so glad I finally did though because it's pretty amazing!! HUGE portions (and I'm used to eating..A LOT for this little body of mine!) Very decently priced for what you get.   Swamp fries: We ordered this as an appetizer and it was great to share! Comes out piping hot and covered with delicious gravy and roast beef. Rib eye steak: We ordered 2 and they were very good for just $15 each. It doesn't come with sides, but I didn't mind. Usually would use A1 sauce on the table if the steak was bad, but none was needed in this case. It was perfectly seasoned and JUICY. Crawfish étouffée: Delish! Perfectly seasoned. The garlic bread that came with it was also really yummy. Shrimp and catfish platter: WOW is all I have to say. Really big serving (yeah yeah, you get the idea. Everything was huge!) Comes with fries on a bed of greens. Served with tartar sauce and horseradish ketchup?? (Not entirely sure, but that ketchup was amazing)  Great little hole in the wall type of place! Love the art pieces on the walls. The kitchen has a glass that you can see through, which is great!  I've been recommending this place to several friends already.

"Not a typical Indian restaurant,  no Bollywood movies! In fact the chefs aren't classically trained ""Indian"". If you are looking for gourmet INDIAN real deal? Then turn around and leave NOLA because I don't believe it exists.  I would say an Asian 'style' menu inspired mostly by Indian type dishes. It's a great bar scene, good fairly priced wine list. Good bar scene for the neighbourhood goin' on. WINE LIST = fair pricing.  Our group of three enjoyed our choices, which accommodated both gluten free ( Celiac) and dairy free. Flavours tamed down to cater for N. American palates, generous portions of good food. (Indian style, no tandoori oven stuff, it's Americanized okay?)  Muted big screen TV had a great old black n white film playing with silent captions making conversation easy peasy in the clean tidy comfortable room, great murals and ambience.

"Some things are simply not as good as your remember . . . hence is the case of returning to Charlie Brown's for the first time in perhaps 10 years.    Still beautiful inside plus the nice historic aspect but the food wasn't as good.    Props for the Yelp check in offer - the chipotle shrimp app was sooo good.  So much so that my daughter asked if she thought we could find the recipe online!    The salad bar was still as good as ever.  They still have the yummy liver pate too :)     Our waitress was a bit ""squirrley"".  I mentioned how long it had been since I'd last been to CB's.  No reaction.  My daughter was like ""she doesn't care mom!""   I asked her to take a picture of us.  She drudgingly did so.  She must have really wanted to choke me when I asked for a re-take b/c I didn't like how I looked! haha!   Onto the entrees.  My daughter ordered medium-rare sirloin and a baked potato.  The steak was in two long pieces????  It was pretty good but no Outback (or Bonefish)  - sorry CB's!    My son got a cheeseburger and liked it but he's 13 so who knows.  I didn't try it.  We brought the burnt pieces home to our spoiled dog.  I had the crab stuffed flounder.  It was decent, but I prefer how they served it much better years ago.    My steamed broccoli was actually good.  I ordered it just to stay w/in my low carb dinners and was pleasantly surprised.    The desserts were BANGIN' good.  I didn't order one but the kiddos did.  Alex's skillet cookie sundae was DELICIOUS, as was my son's cheesecake.  He didn't like it b/c it wasn't the type (creamier) that he's used to.  It truly WAS good though.  I'm super picky about cheesecake.    Our waitress was MIA and I needed to leave to make a meeting.

"So Monday's are half priced burger days/nights at the Brewpub.  The normal burger, 12 dollars is half priced.  I ordered it medium rare, with smoked gouda (which is the cheese for the Prof burger, a higher end burger made with wagyu, and with a ton more toppings.. ). The burger came out medium to medium well, on a Le Bus roll (how 1990s,) and the cheese might as well have been just out of the fridge as it had not melted at all. Gouda does not melt at the same temperature as other cheese, like cheddar or American but considering they have a top of the line burger with it, they should have known how to melt the cheese. Epic Fail. The fries were fresh cut fries, and the whole pub had one bottle (half filled) of malt vinegar. The staff acted as if they were doing me a favor actually allowing me to use it.  .. And then there was the beer. Blueberry Berliner Weisse.. lacking the sour of a BerlinerWeisse, the TYPEA IPA .. mediocre... the Double IPA..drinkable .. the Burning Everything Rye porter .. as good as ever, and the English IPA .. used wrong hops for the style.

"My family has been coming here since I was a little kid, but unfortunately I just came in and saw the woman behind the counter wearing a face shield and no face mask. (If you don't understand why this is a problem, scroll to the bottom.) so, unfortunately we will no longer be eating here, at least until after covid is actually over.  Explanation of various protective coverings: A face mask does not protect you, it filters the air you breath out and therefore protects the people around you from you.   A face shield protects you and people you are talking to from large spit particles coming from your and their mouths.   While a face shield is effective personal protection from viruses that are transmitted through large spit particles, covid is transmitted via aerosolized particles as well which a face shield does nothing for. Wearing a face shield during this particular pandemic is the same as wearing no protection at all, unless worn in addition to a mask.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"As a restaurant, Dooky Chase rates about 3.5 stars.  As an institution it gets 4.  This is definitely a place for power lunches in New Orleans and the history is pretty amazing including its role in the Civil Rights movement.  The walls are entirely filled with unique artwork and the atmosphere is actually a bit nicer than I expected.  The food isn't seasonal but it's comfort food and that's why you come here.  The buffet is a main option for lunch and at $17.95 per person it's not cheap.  However, it does include a drink as well as peach cobbler for dessert which makes the price seem much more reasonable.  The options must change every day but when we were there the buffet sadly didn't include any gumbo - instead there was a small salad bar followed by a soupy bean & shrimp dish served with rice and also with some nice spicy sausage on the side which was great when eaten together.  The other dishes included a stewed salmon with great spices served with a nicely done pasta.  Cabbage casserole was very good and the green beans & potatoes were actually decent - not mushy or rubbery as I expect from a buffet.  At the end of the table were fried catfish and chicken which were even quite good despite being on a buffet.  The catfish probably scares some people being served on the bone with tail and fins still visible but if you don't mind picking meat off the bone that's the best way to do it because the catfish was still moist and tender and tasted great.  Fried chicken was very good and the breast was nice and juicy although the wings were significantly overcooked - I personally wouldn't say it's the best in the world but it's very solid.  In terms of the dessert, peach cobbler was just as expected with canned peaches and a fairly standard texture which was definitely not earth shattering but an okay way to end the meal.  If you're looking for upscale, seasonal cuisine don't come to Dooky Chase.  If you're looking for fast, attentive service this isn't your place either.  But if you're looking for very well done comfort food in an amazing local institution you've definitely found the right place.  If you're from out of town though please keep in mind that you probably don't want to walk from the French Quarter so just splurge for a cab.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I haven't had the brunch here but would like to use the space as a place to sip coffee, blog, and do other work.  One Shot could be ideal for this given the ample space and free wi-fi.  Northern Liberties has a shortage of coffee shops despite the high number of students and young work-at-home professionals.  Unfortunately, the place seems to want to drive away customers like me.    There is no wi-fi until 4 p.m. on the weekends because One Shot wants to turn tables over for brunch and doesn't want patrons to hang out too long. That's a legitimate business decision, but don't advertise free wi-fi when that's only true some of the time.  A sign actually relegates customers using any electronic device to a small section of the upstairs area, though I haven't seen this enforced.  There's seemingly no concern about patrons who sit at tables for hours talking or with a book or some other non-electronic device.  Management seems to have something against internet users for some bizarre reason.   One Shot may be a great place for brunch, but it's not an urban coffee shop by any reasonable definition.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
Super cute place and one of the few restaurants in Summerland. I called to see how long the wait and if I could make a reservation over the phone. Sydney asked were I was coming from and said she would put my name down for 2. When we got there the place was packed. Over a 30 min wait. I walked to the top and said I called ahead for a table and they could not find my name. It was a good thing I had Sydney's name. We were seated right away. The place is very charming on the inside with a very country/grandma's place feel. We were seated at a two person table right by the kitchen with a window overlooking the outside. I ordered the eggs Benedict and my husband had one of their omelets. They are very generous with their potatoes! Good size portions. Food was just ok. They have cute postcards on the table that you can take with you and a jar of lollipops on your way out. There is only 1 bathroom for each gender and there is always a line.

The kid taking my order didn't comprehend, gave me a puzzled look (""so you just want hot peppers and oil on the sandwich?

He acted as if he understood but when I got it home and went to eat it (hours later) the sandwich had banana peppers! Never mind the fact it was a WHOLE sandwich - approximately $25 of lackluster peppers.  Fast forward to yesterday, exactly one week later. Called ahead, ordered a whole sharp Italian + long hot peppers.  She said it would be ready in about 15 min. Show up 20 min later and she didn't even begin making the sandwich.

"After having gone to this restaurant many times and having no problems, I went today with two colleagues and had an atrocious experience.  The food was good, as usual (hence the single star), but we were treated very poorly by the staff.  My colleague ordered his ""usual"" lunch dish.  The server brought the wrong item.  He then told her it was the wrong item and asked for the correct item- minus the avocado (he said this both the first and second times he ordered and he is neither quiet nor hard to understand).  The server brought the right item- with avocado.  He (very politely) told her again that the order was wrong.  She reacted in anger and the two sushi chefs stared over at our table with daggers in their eyes for the next 15 minutes.  The server asked if any of us wanted the food that was the initial wrong order.  Assuming they were offering this because the food was already cooked and they'd have to throw it away anyway, I said I would take it.  My colleague finally received his correct order, we all finished, and asked for our checks.  The restaurant put the charge for the wrong order on my bill!  When I pointed that out, the server got angry and said, ""well, you are taking the food!""  I said, ""this was not my mistake, I am not paying for this.""  She got the manager who rudely snatched my bill out of my hand and took the item off my check.  Then the server walks back over and tells me to GIVE BACK the food!  Stunned, I said, ""well, I've already touched it when I put it in my to-go box.""  She went to the manager again.  They insisted I take the food out of the box (again, with my hands) and give it back.  After she took the food, the server came back over to lecture my colleague on how he should have told her he didn't want avocado in his dish.  We were astounded.

"I wish I could give 0 stars. Last night they ruined my entire birthday party. I called in and scheduled a delivery and it was sent to the wrong address. When I called originally, I didn't have to tell the young lady on the phone my address because it was on file. When i realized the pizza hadn't arrived I called to see were the miscommunication happened to get the matter resolved. The manager had the audacity to call me a liar. I came into the store to try and pick my order up, I gave the man my address to pull up my order and he said it wasn't ready yet, so i left. I've order here plenty of times because this was my favorite pizza spot, so they have my address on file (i know from past orders). The manager has no customer service skills or concern for the customers. There was clearly an operational error last night, but the manager insisted that I was lying and continuously questioned and tested my character, he was way over the line and disrespectful. He refused to remake my order or give me a refund, despite their mistake. The manager also had the nerve to tell me to go to the address his driver dropped off the pizza & get it from them. I will never bring any business back to this place, I can't respect a business staff with no integrity. I wonder if there would've been this much fuss if my skin didn't have any color",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
I've been going here with my family for years. The salsa is fresh and wonderful: subtly spicy pico de gallo full of garlic and tomato and onion and cilantro. I'd almost come just for the salsa! The chimis are good too--pretty cheap and mighty tasty. The other menu items are mediocre--but it's worth it for the salsa and the chimichangas.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Sultana is a fantastic addition to this neighborhood, and hopefully a marker of continued revitalization of an area of the Old Northside once destroyed by the highway that runs through it. Wedged in a historic building between that highway and a power plant, Sultana has its work cut out for it, but its expansive hours, broad menu, outstanding hookahs, and great service sets it up to be a solid neighborhood restaurant.  Sultana's greatest strength is by far its abience. The furniture, the art on the walls, the overall decor, and even the decorative hookahs give a feel to the restaurant that is hard to find in Indianapolis. The owners have put a lot of work into wrapping the culinary experience into a beautiful aesthetic package, and they were definitely successful at it. This carries over into the excellent presentation of the food.   As far as the taste, I couldn't complain, but wasn't blown away. I ordered the appetizer platter and was very impressed by the spanakopita. The falafels were good, though a little crispy for my tastes. All in all, I didn't find myself wowed by anything on the menu.   What I'd love to see on the menu are some Egyptian dishes that are more unknown to Indianapolis. On paper, the menu is very similar to other places serving food from the Levant. While the particulars are different and the presentation is exceptional, I'd love to see dishes like kushari and ful make it onto the menu, which I've only had the pleasure of trying at Egyptian restaurants on the coasts.   I can't wait to see how Sultana develops itself, and I'll definitely be back for the grand opening.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Very disappointed in Pizza Time.  We haven't been there in years, and on Sunday, Mother's Day evening, my husband wanted a cheesesteak.  Our usual go to place was closed, so we decided to get one from here to split.  He ordered a large with fried hot peppers and fried onions ON THE SIDE.  . (I can NOT have hot peppers).  Well after taking one bite, it was very apparent there were some hot peppers on the sandwich.  Looked as if they forgot to keep them off, and put them and the onions on, and then scraped them off and placed them in the little containers.  You could see pieces of hot peppers through out the sandwich and the containers had pieces mixed in with the onions too.   Thank God my grandchildren didn't want any!!!  What if I was allergic???  They obviously knew what they did  since they took them off after it was made but they  should have made a whole other sandwich instead of taking them off.  Needless to say, I couldn't eat it.

"I came here with some friends for a late dinner on Saturday night. We were seated right away. The restaurant was freezing though definitely glad I brought a jacket.   The waitor informed us that if we wanted we could go downstairs to the 21st Street Brewers bar to buy a beer and bring it back up since they had a larger selection (which is what my group did). You can also order the PW menu from 21st street and eat there if you wanted which I thought was a cool idea.  They only offer their pizza's in 12in size which we were told was perfect to share with two people. I was the odd person out in a group of 5 so the other couples got pizzas and I got myself a calzone with a side salad. Even though the menu is relatively smalled I did love all of the options in terms of crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings.  My side salad was sooo delicious and fresh I could have eaten that alone as a meal. Great balance of flavors and textures. I chose to get the shrimp calzone with the honey wheat crust. Simple fantastic. The crust was slightly sweet and very soft and fluffly, and the inside with filled with a generous portion of meat and veggies and so, so much cheese. It was huge but I wanted to eat the whole thing because how good it was.  I tried a bit of my friends regular pizza. It was also very good, nice char bubbles on the crust from the oven.   The service was also great. We ordered our food, went down to the bar, and when we came back my salad and our wings were already at the table. Before I was even finished with my salad the pizza was out. And our waiter was very polite and attentive.

We have a lot of artisan ice cream shops in LA so I was happy to come upon one in Nashville as well.  The people behind the counter don't even cringe when you ask to sample 5 different flavors so go ahead and ask.  Here is my five cents.  Salted peanut butter tasted too salty. More peanut butter less salt please.  Goat milk with red cherries is a little tart but definitely a good flavor.  Brown butter almond brittle has a good crunch to it.  Brown butter ice cream was also well received although it didn't make the final cut.  I like that you can mix and match flavors in your cup or cone.  The cone is a $1 extra I believe but you do get a small piece of the cone in your cup and its delicious.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The chicken was sent back because one side was burnt to shoe leather. .I waited for my chicken and nibbled on  a few fries which were still fresh and taste the way I remembered. Good.

I could have saved myself a whole lot of money by going to the Roadhouse and getting better quality food. The first time we dined here, which was literally less than a month ago, food was bomb!

"Do NOT go there for brunch unless you enjoy waiting for twenty minutes for terrible service and over-cooked and over-priced food. I had the crab and brie omelet and the eggs were dry and the sauce on top of it cold. There was only one tablespoon of crab and a slither of brie and two mangy asparagus, all for the lovely price of $14.00.

"Sorry for the lengthy post but im beyond ticked off. This store doesn't even deserve a 1 star.  I have had an issue here before and should have learned my lesson then but I try to give everyone a second chance.  The staff is rude and incompetent.  When I pulled into the drive thru no one would actually come to the speaker and so after 4 minutes I went inside (only because I was ordering for coworkers and I forgot my phone or I would have left then)  so I go inside. The chick at register (apparently her first day) had an attitude when I walked in. I guess I inconvenienced her by having her do her job.  She got ticked off at me bc after being told to slow down on my ordering, which I did, she then had the nerve to get mad bc I didn't tell her upfront that my 3 separately paid orders all involve chicken so that evidently messes up how they drop the chicken. Like I should know that bc it's not like it is a chicken establishment and one would think as such,  they would just be prepared to make chicken all the time.  Then when that was done and I waited 20 minutes for my meals, I told her she forgot sides. Instead of finding someone who can fix that or even better, go get it her self she tells me that if I open the box i would see sides. Wow! Hadn't thought of that before!  So when I tell her I had already she says ""well what do u want me to do. It's my first day and I don't know what to tell you""   um okay.  You can do your job or find someone whose even slightly more competent to do it for You!   That is just some of the experience.  Let's move to after work when I call to talk to manager or get a corporate number (franchise so didn't get a number) then was told by the rude chick on the phone that the owner is the only manager and I can't talk to him bc he is never there.  Really? That's the only manager for your entire store, is the owner?  Then she gives the phone to some guy and says she is about to smack this ""b**** thru the phone""  again sooooo professional.  The guy claims to be a manager and when I complain about everything and the girl I just talked to on phone and ask for someone over him bc he clearly doesnt care what his employee just said about me to him, he tells me that there isn't anyone to talk to. When I asked if someone over him can call me back he said ""he can write my info down my don't count on a call back bc his supervisor is a busy guy and won't call just to hear someone complain""  Don't waste your time going here!  This place is the worse place ever for service.  I have never actually been somewhere that every single employee is rude,  incompetent and lazy.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Average. We heard good things and wanted to give it a shot. Looks can be deceiving as from the outside I wouldn't even think of going in. But it is inviting inside, nice decor and clean. Service was a little below average, especially for a late lunch on a Saturday. Appetizers and drinks came quickly but we waited a little too long for the sushi. Portions were nice but nothing amazing in regards to flavor. Started with a salad (lots of mixed greens and head lettuce with too much dressing), miso soup (a little too fishy), pork dumplings (average), calamari (just the rings and a little chewy). My kids had the fried rice (yummy and a great offering on the kids menu), we also got a sushi platter (huge rolls, almost too big but nothing i would go back for). Overall you won't get a bad meal but you also won't leave super impressed.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I was at Flyte recently and must say that I was impressed. The menu is very limited but everything I had was excellent. I started with Flyte red wine where instead of a full glass of wine you get to taste three different ones. I kind of like this because I always have difficulty picking a wine. This way you get to taste 3 wines and then you can just continue with the one you like. I had the Flyte salad and the one with pears was amazing. it was out of this world. I would never imagine that a salad with pears could be soooo good. I had the lamb dish as an entre and must say that it was excellent.   The only place which could be improved at Flyte is the deserts. I had the coconut cake and while it was good, it was not as I would expect it to be because my expectations were very high after the wine, salad and entre.   Our server was very nice and knowledgeable. The service was great.  It is a little pricey but I definitely believe that you get what you pay for.

"GMG serves mostly very good food. I feel that some dishes contain vegetables that are not properly prepped, such as pieces of celery or another vegetable with woody fibers that should have been trimmed off. I have noticed this with the cashew chicken. That being said, I love the Mongolian Beef because it is basically well-seasoned beef, onions and lo mein noodles. The spicy heat is perfectly achieved and the flavor is amazing.  The moo goo gai pan is plentiful, wholesome and garlicky delicious. I also really love the orange chicken and wor wonton soup. The large serving of the soup is enough to feed a small family, and contains lots of meat, and stuffed wontons. The crispy noodles that are often served with sweet-sour sauce are addicting.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I might also add there were a fair amount of middle eastern types dining there the couple times I went in - always a good sign. The kibbe  -- something you don't seen on many menus -- was fantastic. Fattoush salad, also great. My friends had shawarma sandwiches and loved them. Bread was fresh out of the oven, and they graciously accommodated my zaatar request (for dipping). The only problem with the Vine is the lighting - way too bright and kills any potential ambiance.

"The service in this restaurant is unbelievably sad.  I ordered a Margarita and it tasted like water.  I signaled a waitress to have her come replace it.  She states, ""I will let you waitress know.""  We physically see her let our waitress (Ariel) know about the poorly made drink.  17.2 minutes go by without our waitress ever acknowledging us or even bringing the new drink.  A server ends up bringing our appetizer and I let him know my dissatisfaction with the drink.  He says I will get you another one, please note 31 minutes has passed by this time.  After a few more minutes the original waitress comes by and ask if Ariel has come by the table and we say ""no not at all.""  She let's us know she will go get Ariel and let her know again.  After 13 more minutes ""Ariel"" comes to our table and says we can't make you another drink it is against our policy.  Please note this is after an hour of sitting in the restaurant and none of the staff whom we talked to have stated anything of sort.  I ask why did it take so long for you to come to let us know this....she says the waitress never told her.  My wife quickly says that is a lie I sat here and watched her tell you twice!!!

Mike was a great server, giving us suggestions that we really enjoyed. We pretty much ordered whatever he suggested and loved it.

Water took forever to get to us.. didn't seem like a difficult drink order. We seem to have come during lobster fest, which turned out to be a disappointment.

I find that many other restaurants' menus still need updating as does the KGII. Everything is heavy bar food. And all the appetizers are the same price everywhere as the entrees, but you get less food. Why? My chicken wings apps were dry, not fresh. The carrots and celery that came with the wings were old not fresh. Calamari dish had more fried peppers than calamari. It was Happy Hour time.

"Beef Dip and Mac and Cheese  This place is all about the comfort food. Had the beef dip here cause my group chat was blowing up about beef dips. The BD had beef brisket, caramelized onion, russian dressing Got a good thick bread on it to absorb the dip. Good taste and while it's not the best i've had but it is far from the worst. Mac and cheese was on sale for 7 bucks that day too and tasted sub par. It was comprised of cavatappi noodles, sharp cheddar cheese, garlic toast. I felt the noodles were a bit tough to eat and thought that the dish should be called Cav and cheese for obvious reasons. Shout out to the garlic toast though. I've been here a couple times before and I'd suggest getting the Monte Cristo, it's really good. Also avoid this place if you want brunch, unless you want rock hard hash.

Also, they dont believe in properly heating the restaurant because it was probably under 60 degrees.  I'm pretty warm blooded and I had to keep my jacket on.  Then, it literally took 15 min or so to get water and menus. By the time we ordered and got our food - over 1:30 since arrival; completely unacceptable!!!  Thats where it really got bad.....after 4-5 bites of my wife's meal, she got almost immediately ill. Now my wife is a picky eater and always goes for very safe bets, so it's not like she went out on a limb. It was so bad that we had to leave, which took another nearly 15 minutes to get the check and close out - even after I told the clown waiting on us that my wife was ill.

"I have ordered pickup and delivery from this location for the past SEVERAL Years it has been open here as I live in the neighborhood adjacent to the location and never ever had a complaint... until now..... and I like steak and bloomin' onions.   I got delivery on 11/19/2020.. delivery was great... food was HORRIBLE... absolutely HORRIBLE. Ordered for two persons... Steak was supposed to be Med Rare... it was well done and tough, Bloomin' Onion was ""ok""... mushrooms smelled ok, but once in the mouth, the olfactory senses picked up an almost cadavar like smell from them.  Salad was fine... Sweet tea had no sugar.   Baked potato was over cooked and hard... the white of the potato had turned a hard brownish tan from being overcooked and the sourcream and chives were missing from the order.   At the point of delivery, I DID send a complaint to the corporate office.  They requested I give them the restaurant location to pass along to the manager.   I responded with the location and that my email is best to use as contact.   I have heard nothing since from the location manager or corporate.   I am to assume that the information either did not get forwarded to the location manager or either the corporate and location manager are not interested in my very disappointing meal and that they have lost a customer.   My bill for two persons totaled $64 and some change.   I should have just thrown that money in the trash... that is where the food went.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"We had a great lunch here, and I really appreciated the Middle Eastern inspired menu.   I am not a fan of meat substitutes, and I find that vegan/vegetarian renditions of American foods (bean burgers, tofu BLTs, soy hot dogs, etc.) are usually off. FYI: I'm a vegetarian because I DON'T like the taste of meat!  So it was perfect to have traditional dishes that are naturally vegetarian (spinach cakes, hummus and falafel)   Our waiter was very personable, and dare I say cheeky. I forgot an expensive pair of sunglasses on our table, and after walking back found him wearing them while standing in the sidewalk waving us down.  We definitely had a delicious meal, and good laugh afterwards.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Mehhhh...........drove all the way over from Hudson and there is 2-3 BBQ joints in my area that are better and then the waitress(younger girl) . It was 4/7/19 at 2ish and she was moody as f***. She only had maybe 4 tables and she gave us all kinds of attitude about getting me a refill after my drink was empty for 10 minutes,she wouldn't even make eye contact with us,my wife had to flag her down which is completely unacceptable. She NEVER came to check on us to see how everything was. I usually give waitress's a lot of slack because it's a tough job but she straight up sucked. To top it off she gave me my bill with a attitude and I STILL left her $7 tip on a $40 bill and she snatched the bill,money and tip off the table and I never seen her again.

"I ordered dinner to go online. The order was wrong (I asked for no peppers on the shrimp appetizer). I called and told them. She said she needed to talk to someone in the to-go area and put me on hold. Instead she hung up on me. I called back. After another long wait, she answered and said she needed to get someone who speaks Spanish. I told her I wasnt speaking spanish. She was confusing me with someone else. She said my online order said no peppers and that meant no red peppers but they always put jalapenos on the shrimp app (that hasnt been my experience) and if i didnt want any peppers I should have written ""plain.""  There was only one option -  jalapenos yes or no, and nothing said that was only red peppers and if i wanted no jalapenos I should write in ""plain."" Basically she said it was my fault for ordering wrong.  Terrible customer service. She said i should just give me feedback on the website and ""maybe"" their online ordering menu wasnt accurate. Bad move. Good customer service says ""I'm sorry how can we correct that error"" instead of arguing it's the customers fault (esp when it wasnt my fault at all). I clearly marked no peppers and it didnt say that was only for red peppers. So now that I am here, let me share about the rest of the meal. The shrimp were wet and soggy from the jalapeno juice. I couldnt eat them. The fries were soggy, drenched with the juice from the ribeye. You should put fries in a separate container. Seems like someone would have thought of this. The caesar salad had huge pieces of lettuce that should be cut or torn into manageable sizes for eating. The steak was ok but had alot of fat that couldnt be eaten, was rare or medium instead of medium well, and lacked the usual seasoning. I wasnt planning on complaining about all of that--just the peppers that I asked to be removed. But every part of the meal (except bread) was bad, and customer service awful.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I live within walking distance of Rocco's, and have been a regular customer since they opened. I've never written a review before because my experience (either very good or very bad) hasn't warranted it until tonight.  It's always just been ""good."" Tonight, a girlfriend and I went to celebrate something. We spent well over $300 when all was said and done. It wasn't worth a fraction of that. Service was super friendly, albeit extremely slow. Drinks came out fast, which was appreciated. But the main disappointment of the night was the food. We ordered the King Crab Legs, a pound. Being well versed in king crab, we expected two full size legs. Instead, we got two quarter legs, both with knuckles, and two knuckles only. Knuckle meat is not appropriate when offering legs. It's tougher and full of cartilage, a mouthful of which we both got. In response to our complaint about an inedible $55 entree, we were merely offered a free dessert worth a fraction of the price. I'm sorry, but if you're serving dishes of that ""caliber,"" you need to be able to back it up with product. Rocco's can't seem to keep up. On top of that, we asked our waiter for a bottle of cab, but not if it wasn't from a specific region. He sent us a guy who knew NOTHING about wine, yet tried to talk us into something we knew we didn't want. Just an overall odd and disappointing experience.

Fast forward upon arrival, there's no self parking. Only Valet. But yet they don't save spots for reservations? Also, they Somehow had NO idea of the reservation, even after my friend showing them the confirmation email.

Brought 2 friends for dinner here, pretty expensive experience for what we got - tried the biscuits with the chicken liver mousse; very nice.

Don't let the strip mall location fool you-the inside is nicely decorated like a fine seafood restaurant.  The space is not large but it was still split with a sound wall with aquariums down the middle and a ceiling design that cut nose down to a reasonable level on a busy night.   I had the side spinach salad  was a bargain.   The shrimp and scallops linguini in  a white wine butter sauce was good but it would have been better with less butter and a little lemon.

"After many attempts, I finally got a chance to dine at Khmer Kitchen! Got there around 11 a.m. on a Saturday (instead of waiting in a brunch line) - and no line! After looking at the menu and ordering, which took 15 minutes tops, every table in the place filled. Lucky me.   Ordered skewers that were on special, spicy papaya salad (Bok La Hong), and Cha Mussels. Papaya is SPICY, but the flavor is on par with most of the Cambodian papaya salads I've had. The skewers were tasty, but I feel like you can find the beef ones with a little more oomph at an undisclosed park nearby! We asked for the pork skewers to be re-grilled since they were slightly pink on the inside and it tasted much better since the glaze got a chance to get charred into the meat. The Cha Mussels were the star of the show: perfectly cooked, sweet, and tender in a super flavorful curry broth. It was perfectly balanced between sweet, salt, spicy, and curry flavor. I wanted to drink the broth.   By the time we finished, there was an hour wait outside. If you're not as lucky as I was, it's still worth the wait!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The dish had absolutely no flavor except for the chicken thighs, and the broth tasted like water that had chicken sitting in it for awhile.

I decided to try Lil' Dumplings again and get something different.  My second experience was a little better. I had the Pork Belly noodles. Like the other reviews, I think $19/$20 was a bit much for a half full bowl of noodles, but at least there was flavor in this dish.

So I ordered me a bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and mushrooms, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, ketchup, relish and mustard. I was definitely not disappointed in the burger. However the fries really aren't that great in my opinion, and at the time the coca cola needed to be changed as it had a pretty watered down taste to it. Like I said the burger was pretty good, but for the $17 price rage all told I think I could've gone somewhere that would've been better.

"I am baffled as to how this place averages four stars. It is entirely possible that our experience was atypical because we were there to carbo-load prior to running a marathon the following day. Luckily we arrived before the masses and were seated immediately, but the crowds lined-up minutes after we were seated. Inexplicably, the restaurant seemed surprised and unprepared for the rush and were turning people away. They were also terribly inefficient at turning tables as the waitstaff took far too long to deliver checks and cash out paid customers. For example, my party waited 20 minutes, credit card in hand, for the check to be delivered, and had to ask twice. We were anxious to vacate the restaurant in order to free-up a table for our fellow runners. Anyhow, we ordered the bruschetta and garlic bread for starters--the garlic bread was a waste of money, even at only $3, I have had better from the grocery store freezer.  The bruschetta was basically a few pieces of thin toast with a small bowl of cold sauce. That said, the sauce was absolutely delicious, even cold. Frankly, that sauce was ten times better than the one I had over my linguini bolognese--the linguini was clearly right out of a box. On the plus side, my daughter's eggplant parmigiana looked perfect with a small casserole dish filled to the brim with pasta, eggplant, and covered in a comforting blanket of perfectly browned and gooey cheese. The decor was kitschy with red and white checkered tablecloths and walls adorned with every conceivable imitation of the famous painting that is this restaurant's namesake.

"After reading other reviews that someone believes they got food poisoning from here, I thought I should share my story as well.   I used to love Soupremacy/Small Batch Soups and would order once a week for lunch. I know COVID has been tough on their business, so I truly feel for them and wish things were different.   When finally back downtown for work yesterday, I wanted to support a small business. I remembered Soupremacy and ordered delivery from DoorDash. For a cup of soup, a small salad, bread, and a can of Diet Coke, I paid $23 with tax. I had a $0 delivery fee, so that was not part of that price. I was in a rush so decided the price was worth it for a one time circumstance and to support this business.   The order arrived quickly. I noticed it didn't have the bread I paid for, but I was okay with that.   When I opened the salad dressing to pour on my salad, it was COMPLETELY covered in mold. I did not eat any of the ordered items because I was now concerned with their food safety practices - thankfully Door Dash provided a refund.  I sincerely hope they're able to get back on their feet as people begin to return to work downtown, but until then... buyer/eater beware.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This Maggiano's in Cherry Hill was not as great as the one in the Philadelphia or King of Prussia location. I mean.. the food was great but the service was bad. Which made the atmosphere bad too..  We went last night for my aunts' birthday, about 14 of us including kids. Once we got seated the server introduced himself and asked if we wanted drinks, we said ""no, water is fine."" Then, he asked if we're ready for starters since we told him we're going to have family style but we're still waiting for more people. We said, not yet since not everyone is here yet. Couple minutes goes by, then he comes over again and asked if we're ready for starters.. keep in mind that our party is not all here yet and it's still the same 6 people sitting at the table. He process and asked if we know what we want to order, he mentioned that he can just put it in the system as ""hold"" then once everyone arrives he'll press the button. Once again we all said not yet since not everyone is here and we want to make sure that everyone agrees with the order before making a decision.   Once the whole party arrived and we were able to order our food. Indeed, we ordered family style since it's basically unlimited food! There were a few items on the menu that I wanted to clarify but the server looked annoyed when I asked him questions. I asked him about certain dishes and sauces since we wanted to make sure we were getting what we liked and not waste food.  When our starters came out, we had to finish every single bite before being able to order more. The other two locations that I've been to, the servers ALWAYS always ask if we wanted more food when he/she sees that our dish is running low. However, this server did not ask us if we wanted more. We had to constantly ask for more and he kept saying we have to finish everything before he can put in more. So once everything was empty then he puts in more and guess what.. we ended up having to wait for another 15-20 minutes for our starters. Then next thing you know, our entrees comes out. BUT, he didn't even ask if we're ready for our entrees and then when we said we're still waiting for our starters and wanted more starters, he says it's too late once our entrees comes out we can't order starters. Like seriously? We didn't even get to enjoy our started or get refills then our entrees came.   So, same goes for our entrees. We were very hungry by this time from all this waiting and we asked for more pasta and meat since everyone was eating so fast. But, he wouldn't allow us to order more since we still had some food in the bowls/plates. My aunt wanted more shrimp scampi since there were no more besides the one that my uncle ate from the plate (literally ate from the big plate) and there was some pasta left from the other side of the table but no more shrimp. The server without asking or thinking, combines the two pasta together. He says to my aunt that there's more pasta once he combines them. My aunt said no she wants a new one then the server kept arguing with my aunt and uncle. Clearly, my aunt asked for a fresh pasta for a reason.. she didn't want to eat someones leftover. The server walked away with a dirty look.  The girl server/helper was much friendlier and attentive then this guy server. I could write more but I think everyone gets my point.  1 star for food and 1 star for the other server since it wasn't her fault and she was nice.

I would have ordered another glass of wine but was never asked if I'd like one, even though my glass stood empty.  The happy hour wine price ($7 versus $9 for the house pinot) was not a great deal.  We had the bedeviled eggs (wonderfully spicy), the wings (skin too flabby and not particularly tasty) and the crab cake appetizer (good but overpriced).  We would have possibly ordered more but, as I mentioned, we seemed to be uninteresting to the bar staff, although there were only a few customers seated at the bar.

"I wanted to go somewhere nice for my birthday, which was December 30th and my husband called to make reservations. When we get there we decided not to valet park so we just walked a block. No big deal. As soon as you walk in the hostess is there and since it was freezing everyone was crowded around there, making it hard to get in. We overhear her speaking to customers before us and she was extremely nice. Invited them to leave their coats, asked if it were a special occasion, and invited them to sit at the bar for a drink while their table was ready. I was impressed with this, until it were our turn. We got nothing except a ""do you have reservations?"" We were a little turned off by that treatment. I'm not sure what the issue was, maybe we didn't look as ""put together"" as the other people there? Anyway, we're seated at our table and the server was right over. He was really nice! We got toasted ravioli for an appetizer and they were ok. Nothing too spectacular. So then we were offered a soup or salad before our meal and we both opted for the salad. The house salad was good but please take note, there is an extra charge for this to the ring of $10 a piece. Had we had known this, we would have declined. So I had the chicken saltimbocca and it was pretty good and my husband had the chicken Parmesan. Maybe I'm spoiled at places like Zia's or elsewhere where you're given a side of pasta with your meal and at $25 a plate we hoped to have gotten a little more, but that wasn't the case. The atmosphere is really nice but a little too dark for my taste, but the food wasn't worth the $100 for 2 people and sodas to drink. I was more disappointed in how we were treated as opposed to other we observed around us. We will definitely not be back and this is mainly because of the service when we first arrived. I'd rather go somewhere else on the Hill if it were my choice.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Visited 8/26/2016 Staying at High Dollar Harbor View Hotel next door we thought this connected restaurant would be a good place for breakfast. Sadly we were mistaken. We walked in the front door and was treated by a young lady. We asked to sit on the Beautiful patio overlooking the beach.  She hesitated a moment But follow us out to the patio.  A few minutes later a young man Who wants to be our waiter came to our table and asked what we would like to drink.  He was very unfriendly and kept walking away like he had a chip on his shoulder.  Very unprofessional.  After another 15 minutes he showed up to take our order, still not the friendliest of people.  Guess we were interrupting his doing nothing time has he acted like it was such a burden to wait on us.   The food was just OK the eggs were a bit overcooked. Sorry We cannot recommend this place for breakfast. Perhaps it's better for lunch or dinner one can only hope. It's to bad sense the patio is a perfect setting across from the wharf and the beach with a great view. At least the young lady helping our waiter was nice and friendly and answered our questions.

"After hearing many rave and great reviews, we decided it was time for a try.  We began our meal with their popular lemongrass wings. I am not a wing person but that was some of the best wings I have ever had.   My girlfriend ordered the pork belly bowl while I had their signature Mo Pho.   The pork belly was crisp and savory but the addition of the fried pork skin was very odd. It felt off with having this added to the dish.  The mo pho was disappointing as it felt like a combination of ramen with pho elements. The mixture of cheese, greens, poached eggs and minimum noodles was not a good mix for me.   We concluded dinner with some of their ""dirty bubbles."" The coffee with Jamison and old fashioned were a great way to cap off the night.  Overall, the wings are definitely worth the stop but the pho was not one I was particular for.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"TWO SLICE SPECIAL REVIEW ONLY  The price at $4.99 for two large slices of pizza and a soft drink was excellent.  The size of the slices was also more than expected. The service was friendly.  The room was small, with only two tables for those who want to eat their pizza just out of the oven when it is at its prime. So, this is basically a take out joint.   We wanted a quick bite to tide us over until dinner. A slice apiece and sharing the drink was our intention.   I requested that the reheat be ""well done,"" in order to bring the ingredients back to life after sitting on display.   What we received were slices that were not hot in the center where the cheese was thickest. That was likely due to the excessive amount of cheese piled onto the pie, out of proportion to the tomato sauce which seemed sparingly used. The result was pizza that could not be picked up by the crust because it was too heavy on the topside.  The taste was weak because of the cheese/sauce imbalance, and perhaps the quality of the cheese and sauce themselves.  The crust would have been improved with a little salt added to the dough.    Not an impressive effort by Pizza Land.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"As a vegetarian, it was an awesome surprise coming here and seeing that their menu featured a vegan Philly Cheesesteak! I ordered this with regular cheese because I am not a vegan and it was AWESOME! Not many places have vegetarian-friendly cheesesteaks so I definitely would recommend this place if you are looking something basic and not too fancy. Also, it was a pretty decent size for the price. The cheesesteak was not the only thing I ordered, I also got their cut fries with cajun seasoning. These did not have as much flavor because the seasoning was not on all the fries but they were cooked well so that they were nice and crispy without being greasy.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I'm not sure why anyone would waste there time here if not for not for the raw and char-grilled oysters. The oysters were fresh, though they were rather muddy.

The venue itself is clean, and has two floors, not a bad date place as it's spacious and there's always a cozy corner to cuddle - but do you want to inflict mediocre cuts of fish on a date?

"The only reason why I am giving this place a 3 instead of a 4 is because of our seating situation.  I made a reservation months in advance for 6 people.  When we got to the restaurant, they sat us at a table which felt like we were in the middle of all the chaos.  It was right by the front door and where the kitchen meet so there were people constantly walking by and bumping into our table.  As for the food, everything we had was great.  First things first, the bread is addicting...especially the cranberry walnut.  Started off with Steak Tartare, Salmon Tartare, Tuna Carpacio and Charcuterie.  Salmon Tartare was by far the best with the Charcuterie board coming in second.  For the entree, we had the shrimp salad, Steak Frites, Trout Amandine, Salmon, and Steak Au Poivre.

"Dim sum has become somewhat of a hot commodity in the City of Brotherly love lately! As much as I like Dim Sum Garden, I didn't feel like taking out cash for this date, so we decided to try a newer spot underneath the Convention Center. It was completely empty when we walked in, which is to be expected of that location, so I wasn't too concerned.   We ordered pork soup dumplings, some chicken sticks, scallion pancakes, and sweet potato tarts. The soup dumplings were great, but everything else was just okay. If I was in a pinch and didn't feel like waiting, I feel like just getting a bunch of soup dumplings would be fine, but venturing outside of that might just leave you a teeny bit disappointed.  The silver lining is that the waitstaff was incredibly nice and helpful, and even shocked on how knowledgeable we, two non-Asians, were about dim sum.

The toast was not toasted just a regular piece of bread with flavorless avocado, chopped tomatoes, which was suppose to be sliced tomatoes and an overkill of balsamic vinegar which  totally overpowered the whole dish, even the coffee tasted funky.  They were not observing the no contact rule, as there was an abundance of condiments on each table.  Other restaurants keep tables clear of everything, even salt and pepper, as to avoid contact with the next customer. I felt grossed out and not safe. Anyway, it was our first and last time here.

"So, I hadn't been to this Chinese Buffet in over 8 years, but I enjoyed it more than my wife did.  However, I visited with a friend yesterday and it was about as bad as it can get.  The food was hardly warm, and they didn't replenish any items that seemed like just scraps left.  I had some of the boneless sparerib meat and it was cold, hard and inedible.  The only redeeming factor was their hibachi, but even the red meat (whatever animal it's from) was tough and gristly.  I was even saddened by their egg drop soup which had no flavor at all, but it looked the part.  Also, if you have to use the bathroom (Men's), make sure you are current on all of your shots.  It's really disgusting and rusted out.  This may be TMI, but I got sick later last night from what I ate there...and that was the last thing I ate before I went to bed.  Their food is better out than in, trust me!  I won't ever come back here and this place makes me nostalgic for Ichiban that used to be where Tibby's is now.

While the bakery is not part of the restaurant, we were able to have dessert at the table and the waiter even brought us clean restaurant plates. So, the two businesses work very nicely together. My only negative was the service delay. A large group came in while we were there and the staff became so caught up in taking care of them that they forgot about us until I went inside, from the patio, to say something.

It was a little stuffy but it was understandable because they were kind of busy. The waiter came and took our order right away so it was quick.  The Summer Rolls we ordered came out quick. The rolls was kinda messy but it was still pretty yummy. The Pho on the other hand was nothing special. We had Pho Tai and the meat cut was fine but the soup is kinda bland.

Now, I didn't get much. However, what I did get blew me away. I was on my way to another function when I stopped in so I got the Cantina Nachos and a water. I know, I'm disappointed  in me as well. So anyhoo, I got the nachos and they were delicious. It came pulled so high that I'm glad that I only got that. I got it with chicken. The chips held up very well with all of the toppings including a gorgeous cheese sauce (no cheese whiz here), Salsa Fresca, a very tasty guacamole, sour cream, fajita veggies, big pieces of chicken (and lots of it, not shredded up or little diced pieces), sprinkled with either cotija or queso fresco. It's so much that I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. For  $9-10, it's a good deal.  The staff was friendly and attentive without being annoying. I was in and out in a decent time.

""Deluxe"" Chicken Sandwich was advertised as ""...marinated chicken breast topped..."" with some appealing cheese, tomato, avocado, bacon, etc.  Except, the expected chicken 'favorite', when delivered, was instead an over-breaded, over-seasoned *fried* piece of something that resembled chicken.  A real disappointment.    I'm pretty sure the St. Louis County Health Department, if they'd known, or been warned, would never have allowed the public to experience a decor replete with exposed insulation, MDF walls and lots of open spaces in the flooring, for so very long.

Worst part was that I had to take some food home, including the Parker House rolls, and they didn't include the chive butter!  Dry bread?!    This is what we ordered:  Cheese Plate: It was good, but not a great mix of cheeses.  It had a lot of goat cheese and there weren't a lot of great accompaniments like honey, sauces, etc.    Purist Poke: This is was probably the most unique and delicate dish of the night.  Great flavors from the salmon with the delicious hawaiian salt and avocado.  Great combination of flavors.  Parker House Rolls: I know it's ""healthyfied"" since they're whole wheat, but they are just not indulgent like regular Parker House rolls.  It's not buttery and creamy with a hint of sweetness and salt.  The chive butter is very delicious.    Brisket Pappardelle:  Great, fresh pasta.  Savory brisket.  The dish is just a bit one note.  No crunch, no sweet, no acid.  Just savory.  It was good, but not great.  Salmon dish: My dinner guest got that dish.  Great crispy skin, but again, nothing amazing.

Absolute worst experience for takeout.  We ordered $70 worth of takeout.  Drive 20 mins to try their food for the first time.  The bag is stapled shut and they were friendly inside.  So I assumed with the recipient being stapled to my bag that it was correct.  However when I arrived home I found out that it was completely wrong.  When I called we explained what was wrong and they said they would make it.  When I arrived back a new bag was waiting.  It was still missing food.  I had pictures of what I received and they argued with me about that they had given me.  At this point I felt completely scammed.  I had received two items from my 10 Item order.   None of my entrees.  None of the deserts.  How do you give someone there food and not even check if their entrees or items that are blatantly on the receipt are in the bag.  I've never left a bad review anywhere.  But I've also never been treated this poorly or had this much of my time wasted by a restaurant.  Never spend your hard earned money at this establishment. They don't deserve it.    Edit.... After going back for the missing food items with my receipt they accused me of lying.  Then proceeded to make me wait another 20 mins for a small portion of a $17.99 shrimp dinner we had purchased and didn't receive.  Well we placed our order at 8:30.  They close at 10PM.  I left after 10PM disgusted.  Only to arrive home to find they still are incompetent idiots.  First thing we notice is massive hair stuck to the bottom our a lid.   Clearly visible without even opening the lid.  It's stuck inside to the food!  They still didn't provide more than half of our items.  We got ZERO RICE.  All entrees come with rice and you gave us none.   We ordered four garlic Naans.  We received what I posted a picture of.  How stupid can you be.  Not to mention the owner is who brought out the food the first time.  So here I am at home with all half my food I paid $70 for.  So I decided to not eat anything so I can take it back tomorrow for my refund.  Well they just so happen to not be open the next day.  Of course even though google said they were open.  So now I will be going back Monday.  I have never felt so taken advantage of by a restaurant of all places.m!  Didn't even try your food but it looked like trash compared to others in the area.

This is a really good donut shop that i've been too. Since it was national donut day I wanted to try something new. They didn't have that many donuts to pick from because of how many people were there but that was ok for us. When we got the donuts they were nice and warm.

"Ok so, I will first behind this review by saying, there was not one Asian person in this restaurant or in the kitchen that should've possibly been an inkling to how the food was going to taste but it was highly recommended so I figured I would try it. The vibe of the place was very ""gentrified hipster"" to me. I wonder what sparked the idea of the restaurant? No idea but anyway I ordered the hamburger fried rice, crab Rangoon, and Hawaiian fried rice. The staff was very nice when I got there but I originally was told that the food would take 15-20 minutes when I ordered over the phone but when I got there it was more like 30-35. The bartender was nice in trying to offer me a drink to kill time but I was hungry and wanted to eat at home which was why I called for take out. The crab crawfish Rangoon was $6 for 2 pieces. Yup. $6 for 2 pieces, and I tasted absolutely no crawfish nor sweet cream cheese-- highly disappointing. The hamburger rice, actually did taste like a hamburger. It's one of those food items that does taste good but freaks you out because you're physically eating rice even though it feels like you're shoving a burger in your mouth. Definitely worth a try! And finally, I loved the Hawaiian rice. A nice blend of curry with the tropical Hawaiian flavors. With that said, I doubt I would go back here because I wanted Chinese food and there was nothing that truly was Chinese. Chinese themed, yes, 100% but that's it. There definitely should be a different restaurant name because it's highly misleading.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Although the coffee shop interior is beautiful with amazing ambiance, I wouldn't say it's the best coffee I've had. I got a nonfat latte - it pretty smooth and had a great latte art, but wasn't as flavorful as I would have preferred. I also wish I had more time to sit down to enjoy the coffee, but we were on our way out of the city, and it was packed! I was actually surprised at how busy it was on New Year's. I also thought the coffee cups were really pretty and unique - very different from any other coffee shops. I thought it was odd that despite being a fairly large coffee shop, there was only one bathroom. Also, the baristas weren't super friendly.   I think I have to give it a go again to really be sure about the rating here, but with so many wonderful coffee shops in the area, this wouldn't be my first stop.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"What's interesting about this place is that they occupy on what used to be Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle (now located on 10th & Race and is a favorite place of mine). Happy Noodle Bar is not as bad as people say it is. My only problem is their constant running out of food. Every time I am there, my friends and I cannot get what we want to order because they ran out (not only one item but multiples). I don't know if they aren't fully prepared or they don't want to make mass quantity because the prices are so cheap. I just don't get it, but they're losing customers!  Many people come for the cheap dumplings, which you can get 4 for $1. They taste ok, nothing too extraordinary. But the deal is now gone. They have changed their menu completely and added on new items. I like the menu change, making it easier to order. Dumplings are now $5.99 and you get 12. They also added hot pot, which is really confusing to me, choosing the broth, the food and the base something, something. But I will try it out for myself to see. As for as the rice dish, I had the General Mao and it was very bland, meat was tough and rice was not hot and dry.  As for the noodle soup, I would recommend they not put so much sesame oil in their soup. It totally killed all flavors and you smell and taste only the sesame oil. Food here is just bland, very bland.  Overall, this place has ok food - above your local take out places and fills you up for a low cost. Their noodle soups are worth coming back for. The decor is nicely done with quality seats, fancy water glass and looks hip.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Every time I go to this chipotle I find more and more reasons to not come back. Like most other chipotles nationwide, they are veryyyy stingy with their protein.........but this one takes the cake with how stingy they are with their beans as well. Like you can't give me half a scoop of meat AND half a scoop of beans. That doesn't make for a very hearty meal at all.   But what really takes the cake is how poorly they are maintaining COVID dining restrictions. There is no enforcement of social distancing, all employees do not wear masks, and there are definitely crowds of patrons allowed to sit next to each other and dine in. I guess it's nice they opened their second door to allow for separate entry and exits; but this isn't very comforting when you have to walk by a group of 16 dine in patrons in order to make it to your exit.   I will probably come back here just because of how much I love chipotle.....but not during the pandemic.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I placed an order over the phone for 15 pieces lemon pepper wing with fries (blue cheese dipping sauce)  and two drinks. I was told the order would be ready at 11:20pm. I went to pick up the order was ready promptly at 11:20pm. When I get home I open the box and there is a 15 piece bbq. I return to the store without touching a wing. They tell me to keep the bbq wings and they will start working on my order ASAP. I waited about 20mins in my car before going back in. Once I came back in, they asked me what did I want and what am I waiting for? I explained to them that I was waiting on my correct order. They asked me where was in incorrect order.. so I walk back to my car to retrieve the bbq wing plate and bring it back in.. then they argue me about replacing it. Mind you I have not touched anything. After they call the manager on the phone (because the manger was not in the building) the manger gives them they okay to make my food correctly. I didn't receive my correct order until 12:15 am When i get home & open the box it was only a 15 piece lemon pepper wing. No fries. No Blue Cheese.

"An overrated and overpriced Latin American restaurant located in King of Prussia's ""upscale"" Town Center, Paladar remains popular among young and old professionals alike for its social milieu and colonial-Latin ambience.  Paladar's environment is loud and bustling, there's low-ambient lighting that compliments its modern-chic interior design that includes vibrant colors and a plethora of empty rum bottles alongside ornate books. The crowd is unsurprisingly homogenous, typical of most inauthentic ethnic restaurants catering towards a white, upper-middle class suburban customer, which is evidently what they aim for: ""Our guests continue to discover the bold flavors and vibrant cultures of Latin America without leaving their comfort zones.""  I dined here for the first time with my wife and six of her colleagues on a Friday evening. We had reservations for seven o'clock, but arrived early to enjoy drinks at the outside bar while we awaited our table. The restaurant was crowded, but there was standing room at the outside bar. Though busy, the bartender promptly served us.  For my first drink, I ordered one of their specialty cocktails, the Chairman's Old Fashioned ($10.50), which I had hoped would be a unique, Caribbean take on the traditional Old Fashioned--it was neither. The only variation on this traditional cocktail was its substitution of rum for whisky and brown for white sugar. I was disappointed to find that they serve it with a muddled cherry and a 1/2"" orange slice--as opposed to the usual peel--on a lot of ice. Call me old fashioned, but I consider muddled fruit in an aromatic cocktail anathema. Because they use regular ice when a single large ice cube would be more appropriate, the drink watered down quickly. As for the flavor, it was cloyingly sweet and fruity and rather light on the rum, which was a shame because the rich complexity of the Chairman's Reserve rum should have been the most prominent feature of this cocktail. Overall, I was disappointed enough that I decided to forgo another one during the meal, opting for beer instead. Paladar's draft menu is limited to four beers, though they do offer a somewhat better selection in bottles, roughly two dozen, at about the same price. I went with Victory Hop Devil ($6) and Evil Genius seasonal IPA ($6.5) on draft, both of which paired well with my appetizer and meal.  Our table wasn't ready until a quarter after seven, presumably because the staff took the time to vacuum under the table. It was nice, however, that our table was tucked away in a corner of the restaurant, allowing our group to have a more intimate dining experience.  We began our meal sharing an order of the Guacamole Trio, trying a variety of the classic and premium options ($16.50). Guacamole is only as good as its ingredients are fresh, and Paladar ensures that they use only the freshest ingredients. The color, texture, and spiciness of the dishes were perfect. The dish is prepared with a generous amount creamy avocado and just enough adjuncts to create a well balanced guacamole. The dips are served with corn, plantain, and malanga chips.  For the entree, I ordered the Rum-Glaze Cuban Pork with black beans, coconut mango rice, and pico de gallo ($18) while the rest of our table ordered a variety of taco dishes, which they all seemed to enjoy. My dish was mediocre. The beans were flavorful but the rice was a little bland. The pork was okay. The glaze wasn't flavor forward. In order to taste it, I had to eat the pork separate from the beans and pico de gallo because both flavors overpowered the pork. Overall, the dish was unexceptional, especially at this price range.  The total cost came out to about $50.  As for the service, it was good. The host and hostess, bartender, and our waitress provided our party with consistently excellent service.  Overall, Paladar is a great place to go for appetizers and rum-tasting (the rum selection is extensive), but I wouldn't go out of my way to return for dinner or to recommend it to others; there are just too many better places serving phenomenal Latin cuisine at more reasonable prices.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"After the Bond flick, we headed to Milk and Honey for some food and drinks.   The name Milk and Honey, first of all, is not apropos for this restaurant.  The trendy-hipster-artsy-ness of the place does not go with milk and honey.  moreover, it was really dim inside, so a name like ""el diablo"" would have been more fitting. The drinks were good, but I can't say the same for the food.  I thought the dishes were overpriced, but the place does have atmosphere.  I have to say it, it's conducive if you want to impress your date and appear to have some class and sophistication.    there were four of us, the total ended at $25 per person.  we each ordered drinks (about $10 each) and we had four plates.  I know it's a tapas restaurant, but seriously, the plates were super tiny.  We ordered prosciutto wrapped asparagus and there were 3 on the plate.  Really?  you are going to make 4 people split THREE spears of asparagus?!?  We also ordered the tuna tartar something, the taquitos and one thing that was good, but clearly not that great or I would have remembered.  good date place.  good drink place.  friendly staff.  not a good place if you plan on actually feeling satiated after eating.    oh, and lastly, the bathroom is really nicely updated... hey!  it's the details y'know!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

It seems like some of their stuff is better than others. Their potatoes are good and the pancakes look really good. I would highly recommend avoiding the quiche. Quiche is a hard food to master and this place certainly hasn't done so- it tases more like an omelet. The espresso drinks also leave something to be desired. I'd recommend sticking to the normal coffee and going elsewhere for speciality drinks.

"The food is definitely great! But I'm unsure if it was worth the price and wait :( I believe everyone should come here at least once while they're in Philadelphia, but on the weekends expect to wait 2 hours (even for a group of 4 or less!) NO JOKE. Unless you go super early in the morning and beat the crowd (we're talking 8 AM people), you're going to be waiting foreverrrr. Luckily, Macy's is only a couple blocks away and you can totally go there, but they won't have any mercy if you miss them call your name. Also, the red velvet pancakes are super overrated. Between 4 people, we ordered red velvet pancakes, kitchen sink, cookie dough french toast, and chicken and waffles eggs benedict -- we were more than full without the red velvet pancakes and even took 3/4 of it home. It definitely didn't taste as good so try to finish everything when you're there. Rosemary potatoes were a little disappointing (I prefer Farmacy's duck-fried potatoes) but the Kitchen Sink gravy was heavenly~~",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I was just talking to my co-worker about how a restaurant treats you can make all the difference in the world.  You will rave about and return to a restaurant that treats you well.  That was not our experience at Waterworks.  My boyfriend (at the time) and I lived in the city a few blocks from Waterworks and used to walk or run by the renovations to the Waterworks area.  Each time we did so we would talk about how beautiful it was and how we would love to get married there.  We would bring our visitors to the pavilion for pictures and point it out while driving on the Schuylkill.  So I truly mean it that I was looking forward to eating here for years.    Our perfect opportunity came when we were celebrating our 1 year Anniversary this past weekend.  We called ahead and made a reservation letting them know that it was our Anniversary.  We were seated and our table was horrible!  We were seated in the hallway with little to no view of the water - very disappointing.  This table should not even exist except for people who are sitting at the bar.  It would have made all the difference in the world if our hostess had given us an option ""This table is available now, but if you would like to sit on the pavilion the wait is 30 minutes"".  I guess I should have said something, but I would have thought that calling ahead would have been enough.  I almost thought that maybe our Anniversary celebration hadn't been conveyed to the hostess but then our dessert came out with ""Happy Anniversary"" on it, which was sweet, but almost a slap in the face.  Our server seemed as disappointed in serving a table in this section as we were to sit in it.    The food was good, but not great.  My appetizer (the oysters) and dessert (crème Brule) didn't seem to be freshly prepared.  I was also shocked that there wasn't a special offered on a Saturday night.  To me that says that your chef lacks inspiration and enjoyment in his/her work.  I had the duck which was ehh.  My husband had the New York Strip which was mediocre as well.  All in all it wasn't worth the expense. We won't be returning nor would we recommend it.  I can't tell you how disappointed we were with this experience.

For our main course I had the Faux Filet Sauce au Poive (black pepper-crusted New York strip with pomme puree and bacon-wrapped haricot verts) which was not only the best steak either one of us has ever tasted, but honestly the best meal I've ever had!  My boyfriend had the duck, which was new tonight so I cant give a better description because it's not on their menu yet, but it was as delicious as the steak.  We kept trading bites because neither of use was willing to give up a bite without an equal trade - haha :P  We're grad students so we can't afford fancy meals that often but this was definitely worth it!

"Nearly two months ago I stopped in to pick up a burrito to go. As I brought it home and started eating it, I bit into a thick piece of metal which cut my mouth and cracked my tooth. I immediately emailed Izzo's to let them know of the situation. It took nearly a month to get someone on the phone, and then I was referred to someone at corporate. Conrad Fountain called me and I missed his call, and I returned it nearly every day for three weeks since. Finally today, when I called and spoke to someone else there and told them he wasn't returning my calls, he did. He accused me of lying and said the metal didn't come from his restaurant which was after he lied and said he has returned my call several times, which phone records can prove he has not done once. Funny since he's up in Baton Rouge, I don't know how he could account for every piece of metal in the restaurant, but that is neither here nor there. The customer service at Izzo's is despicable at best. It's bad enough that I had to experience biting into a piece of metal and the dental distress and cost associated with it, but to be spoken to and lied to by the people at the top of this corporation is unacceptable. Not even an apology from them. Also, the burrito was mediocre, even if it wouldn't have harmed me. Go to Juan's or Felipe's instead.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Too bad that five stars is the limit, because I'd give them more if I could.   Caposey's is a GREAT family owned little place that serves great food in a very comfy and friendly atmosphere. If you're looking for a great Sunday (or any day, really) breakfast spot, you've found it. But get there early because the locals are definitely on to it.  This morning we just beat the rush -- there was a single booth available. I had the special, which was what they called a Surf n Turf Benedict, one poached egg on a crab cake and another poached egg on a small steak. A great idea, but also great execution; the crab cake was delicious and staffed full of crab, and the small breakfast steak was tender and flavorful. Homemade hollendaise that's as good as you will find anywhere.  I didn't have the pancakes this morning, like I usually do, but I can tell you they are the best pancakes you will have anywhere. Flavorful and sort of eggy, but not overly so. They will be glad to serve you sugar-free syrup, and they always heat the syrup before bringing it to the table.  For lunch, the soups are homemade and terrific, and there is always a lunch special (and a dinner special as well, for that matter.)  This is diner food of the highest quality, and the service is friendly and attentive.  Caposey's is run by a couple. Don't know that I've ever known their names, but the woman is the hostess and manager and the husband works the kitchen. I believe their son, who is probably around 20, works there now as a waiter. There used to be a restaurant in Palm Harbor called Kissin' Cuzzins, and this couple worked there way back when, she as a waitress and he as a cook. The woman told me recently that she had worked at Cuzzins for 11 years before it closed and they decided to move up US19 to Pasco County to take over Caposey's, which had been a family run place until the original owners retired.  These people know how to run a restaurant.  Caposey's is not hard to find, but you have to watch for it. Head north on US19 from Pinellas County; a couple of miles north of State Route 54, start watching on the right for Green Key Road.

"3 stars = ""A-OK"", so that's my rating for now.  I hope this goes up with future visits.  Sushi possibly comes in third place after pizza and pub grub on the list of ""Ubiquitous Foods of the Main Line"", but I was nonetheless excited to see another spot open up.  I've had no awful experiences with the sushi out here, but no ""wow!"" moments either, so I looked forward to paying a visit to Mt. Fuji to see where they fit on my raw fish continuum.  I stopped in for a spontaneous lunch date with myself.  There were two other parties in the restaurant, but no host/hostess or waiter/waitress in sight.  The only employees I saw were the three sushi chefs at the bar, who were engaged only in staring at me while I stood at the front of the restaurant awkwardly, wondering what I should do.  There was an electrician working on the light switch by the door, so I asked him if he knew whether there was a host/hostess; he confirmed there was.  I was in no rush, so I plopped down on the bench by the door and waited.  A few minutes later, said hostess appeared; she was doing double-duty as hostess/waitress.  I requested a seat at the sushi bar (which has iPad Minis[?] built in for internet browsing, if that's your thing) and was handed a menu.  Like a lot of other sushi places, Mt. Fuji offers a more diverse menu, including soups (the pumpkin and gyoza lemongrass sounded especially interesting); tempura, teriyaki, and wok entrees; noodle dishes, agemono, and more.    After deciding to stick with sushi, I ordered the Sunset Blvd and Autumn of Philly special rolls.  The quality of the fish and the construction of the rolls were very good, and the portion sizes quite generous.  Overall, I'd say Mt. Fuji is superior in each of these respects to the other area sushi restaurants I've visited.  However, I was glad to be eating by myself, because these suckers barely fit in my mouth (which is, admittedly, abnormally small), and I'm sure I looked like a total dingus eating them.  The rolls also came with complimentary miso soup which, while tasty, only had trace levels of seaweed and tofu.  I wasn't upset about it since it was free, but had I ordered it on its own and gotten what was essentially a bowl of broth, I would have been disappointed.  Despite the initial service awkwardness, the hostess/waitress was very friendly and attentive (though not overbearing) and prompt with taking care of me.  I'm still a bit perplexed that not one guy of the trio at the sushi bar took any sort of action while the hostess/waitress was MIA.  Because the sushi was tasty, well-prepared, and good quality, I'll cross my fingers that they work out their opening kinks and coordinate their service more effectively.  In summation, I wasn't wowed by my initial experience at Mt. Fuji, but it wasn't so ""meh"" that I won't return.  Overall, I'm optimistic about my next visit, and look forward to trying some of the other things on the menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

They must get get a lot of complaints for him not to care that I share my horrible experience here that he in turned yelled at me and called me a ""Piece of Shit"" when I told him I didn't want a refund but would be sharing my experience on Yelp he said "" I don't give a fuck what you do you are a piece of shit anyways"" and hung up on me.

"We walked in the restaurant and received a very unwelcome vibe. We had to seat ourselves outside and we were ignored for 15 mins. No one came to service us even just water. The waitress kept walking by and trying to avoid making eye contact with us. 30 mins passed, we decided to leave and one of the host tried to stop us but it was too late. We ended up at Stanley's and had proper service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
Didn't expect tough meat in a taco.  That suggests they are buying inferior cuts.  And the bottled drinks are tasteless.   Layout is poor:  condiments much too far from the eating area.

"Great service, good pizza.  Other than that, there's nothing special going on here. When I first arrived in the area from Boston in 2003 I found these guys similar to the Bertucci's chain up north - which was a good thing!  Most nights you'd find the owner hustling and calling out tickets while his wife made her rounds making sure every table was happy. They were a sight to see, and the place had an energy that made you want to come back. The food treated better too.  When they sold or left they took the mojo with them, and sadly it just isn't the same joint anymore.  We have them a try recently and were hit with an odd smell walking in. In hindsight, I wish we'd just turned around right there.  While my pizza was good, and the sausage soup was excellent, my lady did not have a good meal. She ordered the ""new recipe"" chicken parmesan, and it just didn't do it for her (or me either).  Another thing worth mentioning... The drinks were tiny and weak - boo! They certainly weren't made like this in the past, which is right where I think I'll leave these guys - in the past.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I met an old friend for brunch at Half & Half with very high expectations. My friend is a brunch fanatic and just about dragged me to the cute restaurant. Everything about Half & Half was appealing, starting from the attractive location and cool logo.   The interior was modern and quaint, with cobalt blue walls and hardwood floors. Our service was very attentive and ready to answer any question. I could not decide between the oatmeal and the sausage biscuit and he talked me through the pros and cons of each dish. I ended up going with the sausage biscuit, which was a great decision because it was the best breakfast sandwich I'd ever had. The waiter informed me the sausage and the biscuit are made in-house, and I could certainly tell by the high quality and delicious taste. The sausage was spicy and maple-flavored, which complemented the sharp cheddar and perfect scrambled eggs well. The biscuit was buttery and just the right amount of crumbly. The sandwich came with a side of potatoes, which were good but nothing spectacular.   I also really enjoyed the loose-leaf black tea, which was served in a warmed cup with German rock sugar on the side, a nice touch.  Overall, Half & Half was well worth the price and the drive and I will be back for sure next time I am in St. Louis.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"ALERT! This place needs some team building exercises, pronto! Let me preface this by saying I'm a sucker for cutesy places but we were on a time crunch so instead of eating in I ordered to go. Unfortunately, we weren't there but 6 minutes and I heard, not one, but two of the staff being downright you-know-what's to other staff. It was the kind of thing you'd see in a reality tv show. The funny thing is, they weren't even that busy. There was maybe one or two couples waiting for a table and one other person ordering to go. I'm not shocked anymore by rudeness because everyone has a reason for why they woke up on the wrong side of their childhood traumas but as good humans, we need to learn how to productively process our negative feelings instead of taking them out on our coworkers. For the place itself, it's stunning. My drink and cake were both very good. I especially liked how the flavors and sweetness were subtle so you didn't feel sick eating your $13 piece of cake.

Every year we get a king cake from here during carnival which is unbelievable.  So while in the area we thought we'd try it for brunch, and it was very much left to be desired. The croissants were not flaky in any way and very sweet, totally different texture. The ratatouille omelet was extremely bland. The French onion soup was fine. The eclair was more like French bread than a pastry. We will keep coming back for king cakes, but not for anything else.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The man at the table behind us got the wrong burger, and when he brought it to the waitress's attention, she promised to fix it, and never did. He sat there for 20 minutes waiting for a new burger.

"My boyfriend and I had a really great meal here the other week. I really loved the atmosphere - the decor is simple and elegant, but casual at the same time.  The restaurant was busy, but because it is on the smaller side it has a more intimate dining feel.  The waitstaff was excellent. They were attentive without rushing us, which is often a hard art to master.    In my opinion the complimentary shot of butternut squash soup was the most delicious thing we had all night...well except for the chocolate cake, but I will get to that later.  We started out with the applewood smoked salmon, fried egg, sour cream, crisp potato, mizuna. It was interesting and delicious. For our second course we ordered the corn risotto and pumpkin ravioli - the pumpkin ravioli was to die for! I have to admit I wasn't as impressed with our main courses. My boyfriend ordered the slow roasted chatham bay cod, broccoli, romanesco, spaetzle, chicken jus and I had the lancaster county poulard, butternut squash, lardons, chanterelle mushrooms.  They were both good, but not out-of-this-world-good like I was expecting.  The cod seemed like it was missing something. This is the only reason I am giving it 4 stars.  And that brings me to the dessert...we split (and by split I really mean that I ate almost the entire thing with little help) the chocolate cake with homemade gelato.  It was awesome...warm and oozing with chocolate!!  I would go back just for that dessert.  All in all, we had a great meal. The price was reasonable especially because it is a BYOB.

"I took a group of co-workers there for a celebration dinner tonight.  When I ordered a cocktail, I was told that they did not have my brand of tequila.  I was not surprised but asked what they had to offer.  The bartender said they only had one brand, an off-brand that I was not familiar with. I asked if I could have a taste to see if I wanted to go with it or a glass of red wine.  The bartender said that they do not offer ""tastes"" and I would have to order a drink if I wanted to taste it.  The bartender was pompous and clearly was not aware he was in the ""service"" industry. The manager caught wind of what was happening and bought me a drink, but made a comment that I found condescending about my desire for ""top-shelf"" tequila.  This place is run by a bunch of early 20 somethings who do not understand the word ""service"".  BTW - I am 47 years old, but when I could not read the menu due to small font and dim light, and I asked if they could round up some ""readers"", the waitress asked what ""readers"" were.  When I suggested that most restaurants keep a spare pair of magnifying glasses to help people, with not great vision, to see the menu, she laughed uncomfortably long and said no.  It is too bad that a company that put this much investment in a facility, would entrust it with a band of kids who did not care for the brand or have any training in service.

"This is a hotel eatery.   The whole place has been remodeled since I was here last year and it's absolutely gorgeous. However, with the bar just out front, the traffic pattern is really wonky.   Since I was staying in the hotel for a convention, this was the easiest place to grab our food, however the prices were a bit exaggerated. I don't do buffet eating most of the time so I had to order off the Ala-cart menu and found that coffee and oatmeal for $9 was a bit out of line.  That being said, the service is incredible.   We had a bad go of things our first visit: We came in as they were transitioning from breakfast to lunch and tried to order off the breakfast menu. I wanted a specialty omelet and my date, the Belgium waffles. While we waited what seemed a long time, our waitress finally came out and told us that the waffle iron had been turned off and they had no waffles to be given out, could he order something else. Ok, that's fine but why wait 15 minutes to tell us.    While he was perusing the menu once more, my food came out. My omelet was missing the ham, had spinach on it and when I got to the center, uncooked egg whites came rolling out. That about turned my stomach.  I get it, things happen and when it does, the management takes care of things. And take care of things they did.   I can not fault them at all for their response!   Sherri the manager came over to make sure that my date's order was placed and then she found out my issue and apologized profusely. She asked me if I wanted something new, I opted for the Lunch menu on this go round. I ordered a spring Mozzerella salad, and my date the pancakes. In the end, both of these came out perfect and we were told it was on the house. Like I said they took care of it promptly and without complaint. The service was AMAZING.   On my stay, I visited two more times: Once I had their french style chicken with gouda mashed potatoes and spring vegies. This was just a tasty baked chicken. And I tried their tail-gate buffet. It was alright if you weren't aware most of the things were Sysco frozen offerings.  Certainly not worth the $20 price tag.   TL:DR?

"I was in St. Pete visiting a friend and she recommended this place for dinner.  We went on a Friday night around 7 PM.  The restaurant has limited seating - maybe enough for 32-36 people inside  (including a counter/bar near the back by the kitchen) and about 8-10 outside.  When we arrived the restaurant was busy but several people were finished with their meals and waiting to pay their checks.  We were asked if we had a reservation and we said that we did not, and the server tried to turn us away until a woman who was waiting to pay her check stated that they would be leaving and that we could have their table.  After about 15 minutes we finally were seated and by this time a total of 5 tables had cleared out though in their defense, they were expecting a party of 12 to arrive, however, again not out of the norm for a Friday night and there was not a wait so, busy but not super busy.  The only reason that this doesn't get 5 stars is the service and the attitude of the female server who greeted us - the guy who ended up waiting on us was fantastic and I tipped him well because he deserved it and they were busy.  I understand feeling overwhelmed, but if you choose to work in this industry AND want good tips you have to at least play along and welcome guests particularly if you have a lot of people almost ready to clear out.    Okay - that being said, We ordered two different types of hummus to share - the Hummus Zaytim (with olives) and a spicy hummus - both of which were delicious.  I ordered the Meze Original which is a falafel pita with a generous topping of Israeli salad and a small side of homemade potato wedges and my friend ordered the Flat Iron St K which came with vegan sliced ""steak"", caramelized onions, wild mushrooms, cheese and house-made hot sauce on garlic flat bread and a small side of homemade potato wedges.  After the hummus neither of us could eat more than a couple of bites of our main courses which we took home.  Overall the food was excellent but the service staff needs to tighten up.  If you can't handle the heat so to speak then you need to get out of the kitchen.

"Pearl boasts various seafood dishes, steaks, soups, sandwiches, and salads.  The special of the night was a ""seafood platter""... fried calamari, fried shrimp, fried scallops, and fried fish.  Hmm, I'm always skeptical when the ""special"" of the night is a fried everything platter?  Makes me think of low grade seafood masked by batter.   Pearl has a decent selection of craft beers.  I tried the Mammoth 395 IPA which was good.  We started off our meal with soup that was supposed to be shrimp and scallop chowder but turned out to just be salty clam chowder.   For dinner I ordered the Snoopy Salad Pita.  The salad mixture was delicious... crab meat, bay shrimp, avocado, hard boiled egg, green onion, mixed with a light vinaigrette.  The salad was supposed to be served with butter lettuce in a warm pita.  No such luck with the butter lettuce and the pita was served cold and dry.  The salad itself would be great on it's own.  In my opinion, the pita is too bready for the light seafood salad.   My husband had the chicken sandwich, which he said was mediocre.  Our friend had the Jambalaya which he said was good.

"This place has gotten a lot of bad publicity but I figured why not give it a shot since we were in the mood for some Pho on a cold Sunday night. Considering that this place is called ""Stock"" one would figure that their soup based items would be their staples, if not their flag ship choices. My girlfriend and I ordered Thai Pho (okay first off wth) and chicken pho. The chicken was really tender and great, and noodles were drawn properly so it wasn't all mushy, and our glass of water was consistently refilled (great service by out waitress while we were seated at the bar), and that's about it.  The complexity of the chicken-based pho was equivalent to that of a can of chicken broth. We were convinced they must have used the spices into the fan, because it sure smelled like pho, but didn't taste like pho. I had to ask for some fish sauce just to give it some flavor. The ""Thai Pho"" was the same soup based with some sour flavoring (tamarind?) added and spices, it was slightly better.  My girlfriend is Vietnamese so has definitely tried her fair share and grew up with this soup every Saturday. Also, no beef pho?

"I'm only giving 3 stars based on the food I got yesterday.  It was not pizza, so when I do get it, I will update my review.  I was so excited to see a place by my house that offered Middle Eastern food.  I'm a falafel nut so picked that up to go.  Now maybe because I got it to go, but when I unwrapped the sandwich, it totally fell apart.  The good news is the falafel tasted wonderful and very high quality.  There was also a nice mix of fresh lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber on top.  However, the pita pocket was a cheap, whole wheat (dry) from a grocery store.  With such good toppings, they should spring for a better quality pita.  I prefer mine with the thicker no-pocket pitas.    Staff was okay.  Not friendly, not unfriendly.  It does get packed and like others have said, the paying after your meal is strange.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"A group of six friends including myself made the 3 hr day trip to St. Louis to check out the City Museum and then catch a concert that evening. We were looking for a place with American food at reasonable prices that was comfortable... Especially given that there temps were in the upper 90s that day. When choosing the place to eat, we wanted to remain somewhat near the City Museum and wanted a mom and pop shop. From the little research we could quickly do for being out of town, the description of this place SEEMED to fit the bill. We seen moderate priced and American food and thought we would give it a try. First we notice how small the building was from the outside, however we loved the park like setting. Because we were from out of town, it was an extremely hot day, and we planned on doing a lot of walking, we were dressed in normal jeans, t-shirts, shorts, and hats. Summer attire. When we walked in we IMMEDIATELY knew we were in the wrong place because it appeared very very upscale... More so than our research had hinted at. Despite how small it was inside, we noticed several empty tables. We noticed those that were in there all were wearing suits and ties and seemed very upscale. We figured well it's downtown, it's probably just business people eating a quick lunch. Once members of the staff noticed us we realized just how snobby this place was.  They gave us the looks as if we did not belong at all. We were ""greeted"" and told there was no space for us inside (Um, they only had 3 tables in use out of several empty ones still left!) or we could sit at the bar. This left all of us with the sense that they did not what us to be seen inside their establishment because we weren't ""good enough"". They sat us at the ""bar"" (since we refused to sit outside in 98 degree heat and humidity). We opened the menu and realized how small it was. Then we noticed that there wasn't much ""American"" about the menu at all. It was all very, upscale, snobbery type food.... Then the prices... $15 for a bowl of ramen?? Was that a joke? $6 for a side of French fries? RIDICULOUS prices. We looked around us a bit at the plates of food others were eating and noticed the portions were not proportionate with the prices on the menu at all.  We all agreed this was not the place for us, we very very politely told our waitress that we needed to go elsewhere due to dietary needs. We didn't want to be rude, so we apologized several times. The staff indoors seemed very relieved they would not have to serve us. Once we walked back outside there was a man working on putting together more tables. We asked him for suggestions and asked him if the food at the ""Flying Saucer"" was any good. His response, in a very very snobby manner was ""Well you guys won't eat here and this is the best food in downtown so I don't know what to tell you"". Excuse me? We are from out of town. It shouldn't matter if we are eating at your establishment or not, we are human beings and he should have been a bit more helpful and understanding that than. We asked him for directions to the Flying Saucer and he told is it was way far away ""down that way somewhere"". Gee thanks I thought. But being the friendly Midwesterners we are we thanked him and headed in that direction. What we found was that the Flying Saucer was neither that far away at all, or in the direction he sent us. We did however find ""American"" food there at reasonable prices, comfortable atmosphere, and a extreme let appreciative, attentive, and friendly staff.   My suggestions - if you are from out of town DO NOT GO HERE. If you want American food, DO NOT GO HERE. If you do not own at least own or two platinum cards, DO NOT GO HERE. If your a snobby person and enjoy ""experimental, NON AMERICAN food, you might do well here, otherwise stay away.   My suggestions to the owners - change your descriptions to Bette reflect what type of establishment you have if you don't want others from out of town just waltzing in as I gather you don't from our experience. Don't kid yourselves. You are NOT moderately priced, you DO NOT have American food, and you ARE NOT friendly, comfortable and welcoming.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Maybe average... I like the location, the kitchiness, the menu concepts and the atmosphere, but the execution is missing. The tapas were more like american chain fare kicked up a notch. We ordered about 5 different dishes including grilled goat cheese, artichoke, Hoisin BBQ Shank, mussels tajine, and dessert.  The Hoisin BBQ beef tasted like it had been smothered in a doctored KC Masterpiece sauce, the goat cheese lacked depth, mussels were not cooked in a tajine and were served cold, and the signature chocolate dessert was something you would find on a picture menu in a Chinese restaurant. We were excited to try this place. We were unfortunately disappointed. If you are looking for a drink, kicked up bar fare and some atmosphere it is a good place to stop.

Not only that, whoever is Managing the restaurant is doing an excellent job as I am a professional cleaner and run my own maid service so I always notice the cleaning and organizational aspect and it is kept VERY CLEAN AND ORGANIZED, whenever one of the staff was not busy they would clean, organize or I am assuming just following the standards and procedures set up for them and they are doing an outstanding job!

They're also regularly out of stock on basic items - like beef, cheese, etc.  Literally drive the extra 10 minutes to the one up north or further south on Gallatin if you actually want to get what you ordered.

The slices, as mentioned elsewhere, are big and delicious.  A slice and a drink makes a great lunch.  While the slices are good, they don't compare to the whole pizzas and the sandwiches.  The white pizza is fantastic; try one.  The stromboli is to die for; seriously.  Try the chicken carbonara stromboli for a flavor experience that will make you an instant Venzo's devotee.

"We came here for dinner on a Friday night. I got the 4 course tasting for $35 with +$5 for the Egg Raviolo, and +$3 for the lamb, I also chose the tuna crudo for starters and the spiced cheesecake for dessert. To start, the Tuna Crudo was good, lightly seasoned, and the tuna was fresh. The Egg Raviolo however was rather disappointing. The pasta was barely above room temp and the pasta was doughy. Beside the runny yolk, the rest of the single raviolo was stuffed with three cheeses including ricotta and parmesan. It was rather heavy has others had described, but the glob of cheeses was just that, heavy with little flavor. For entree I got the lamb, which, as a tasting menu, comes with 2 pieces served with lentils. One piece was cooked as I asked medium-rare and flavorful, but the other was essentially rare. The small (size of a roma tomato) spiced cheesecake was good, not too heavy and served with ginger-poached pear cubes. For the variety, the total price was ok, but in my opinion, the quality did not meet the value or the hype.  My other dining companions had the butternut squash ravioli which was good, the pasta was al dente and the filling was rather flavorful without bring too heavy. We also got the off menu pasta special of stracci pasta with chicken confit and spinach. The stracci was also perfectly cooked, al dente, however it was served at just barely room temperature. The shreds of chicken confit was also rather tasty.  Overall, for me, it was a lacklustre experience, perhaps overhyped.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I REALLY wanted to like the legendary Drago's.  But after a weekend in New Orleans, hitting multiple restaurants and tasting all types of Creole cuisine, this place was one of least enjoyable.    Maybe because it's adjacent to a hotel, it looks the way it does.  I dunno.  But the place did leave much to be desired.  It looks like an Old Country Buffet and you would think for the prices, it would be much more.  Not sure what the other location looks like.  Anyway... the food.  I debated giving it 4 stars because of the plate of oysters.  The oysters were delicious but again, not as good as other places in New Orleans I've been.  But they were the saving grace of the meal.    Lobster Marco -  Felt like it could've been more.  It was hardly any lobster, it was rather small and the pasta and sauce wasn't anything spectacular.  The best part about it was the shrimp and that's because there were plenty of them.  But for one of their ""favorites"", it was a little disappointing.

"I visited Grain Exchange last Friday for dinner and drinks with a couple classmates/friends from the nearby Lutheran seminary. None of us is vegetarian or vegan, so we appreciated having a full menu of meat friendly options - something we've found to not be the case with many of the surrounding restaurants in Mt. Airy. All three of us live out of the area so we're always on a quest to find good places to dine while in town for classes.  Service - Mostly prompt and right on point. We were seated immediately and drink orders (beer all around) placed. It took a bit longer than expected to receive the drinks, plus to order and receive our meals. But we weren't in any hurry whatsoever, so this didn't pose a real issue.  Ambiance - Grain Exchange has a warm, inviting feel to it which felt more akin to visiting with friends in their home than in a restaurant. It was busy, but not packed, and the noise level wasn't excessive. It has a distinct pub feel to it and it was easy to unwind and relax with good friends.  Beer - We eached ordered something different from the tap, ranging from a light pilsner to a dark ale. We deliberately switched it up for the second round so combined we could try six different brews. None disappointed, and the price was reasonable for the neighborhood.  Meal - Between us we had the fried chicken sandwich, the scallops and the open face meatloaf sandwich. All three were good, solid choices - if nothing particularly extraordinary. Nothing wrong, but nothing in the 'OMG - where has this been all my life?' realm either.  Price - Dinner for the three of us, including two rounds of drinks, came in at just shy of $100. This was a bit higher than expected for the neighborhood, but across the board everything was above average so it wasn't an issue. Especially for my friends, since dinner/drinks was my treat.  Bottom Line - Grain Exchange is a solid option to dine and/or enjoy a drink. It definitely warrants a repeat visit on future trips to the campus.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I came here with a large group the second week they were open so I was anticipating and mostly understanding of the sluggish service. That being said I was still quite annoyed when I called ahead to find out how large a group I would need to make a reservation (parties of 9 or more) and then was told an hour later after rounding up the crew that they could not reserve us a table at anytime the night I wanted! After stressing over having potential back up dinner plans, they did manage to seat us at 7. After the happy hour specials ended the restaurant quieted down, but our service maintained its slow speed. Our server even left the table before taking one of my friend's orders! At the end of the meal we were left waiting to be offered the check for a while during which 3 hostesses chatted by the podium right next to our table. If you are going to provide slow service, at least make the effort of having everyone in the restaurant seem super busy!  Most of my group was happy with their food but not blown away. I thoroughly enjoyed the salsa which had a smokey flavor. I also ordered table side guacamole for the table. The table side aspect was lost on me since I was not in a position near the person making it, but the end result was tasty. Very creamy and smooth although you can get it chunkier if you prefer. As far as tacos go I tried the grilled fish and Al Carbon. I really enjoyed the fish, especially the sauce on it, but I was less impressed with the flavor of the second taco. The tortillas were also a little bland. I had a bite of my friend's grasshopper taco, because he didn't feel like finishing it and I understand why! It just tasted like a tortilla filled with salt! Not sure what grasshopper is supposed to taste like, but I was hoping for a different flavoring than that. I also shared an El Camino pitcher with friends. It was good, but came with a bit more ice than appreciated.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was good. It was a little loud at first but calmed down later. I loved the triangle bar and large amount of outdoor seating. I could definitely foresee coming back for some drinks and guac after work and I'm curious to try their special Schlafly brews. I think their service and food definitely has the potential,  but I'll probably satisfy my next craving for Mexican in the CWE at Tortillaria and give this place some time to work out their kinks.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Would love to have had sauceys pizza but unfortunately I never received it. When I placed my order the wait time was 45- 55 minutes through Grubhub but once it was confirmed sauceys changed the time to 1 hour and 45 minute wait. So when I called the restaurant to see if there was a glitch, the phone was answered by an extremely rude employee. He started yelling at me explaining that it was only him making the pizzas with only two delivery drivers and because of that he changes and confirms all order time to over TWO HOURS so he doesn't get bad ratings on Grubhub. Now, I completely understand being short staffed and I was just calling to see if maybe it would be better if I came to pick up the food myself.. but since this man answered the phone so rudely, I immediately felt uncomfortable with him handling my food. He was so irate that he couldn't even finish the conversation so he hung up on me.

They are a tad spicy, just so you know.  One of the people in my party got the pork tenderloin, and holy moly: That thing was big. I think it was the biggest pork tenderloin I've ever seen.

"Visited on trivia night and had a burger and fries. They were well seasoned and the environment was nice. It also was 4th of July so there was a perfect vantage point of the fireworks. Be warned though that the debris does not distinguish on who get pelted in the chest. I will reserve comment on the beer selections as I do not care for beer.

"Looking for a cup of coffee.. CHECK.  Nice place to eat a nice brunch or lunch.. CHECK.  Cool ambiance..CHECK.   OCF is definitely a nice place to go for a casual dining experience in the Fairmount area.  Been here more times than I can count with friends for casual lunches.  My favorite is the chicken salad sandwich.. but they also serve up a very nice classic brunch. I go for the eggs, bacon, potatoes.. that sort of thing.  Ambiance is very cool and relaxed.. people are coming to casually eat with friends, or eat and study, or work on projects.    Feels like a go-to neighborhood spot if you live in the area.  Love the open air feel of this restaurant. Coffee is good, not the best I've ever had but will definitely serves its purpose for a nice cup of jo... and don't forget their selections of sweets and desserts enticing you as you place your order.  They are worth trying as well!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"They move you in and out like you're animals. Wait staff was short, and would only show face to take your order and give the check, dont expect a coffee refill. The cashier also was rude, and also short worded. Yes, they pump a lot of patrons through there in a day and I'm sure it's a stressful place to work, but it was a major let down to be met as an inconvenience after waiting in the line. Food was mediocre; we got apricot lemon pancakes and the melody. Melody was below average. Would not return, would not recommend.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

We came close to closing time, so I'm assuming our service was sketchy due to that. I won't be too critical, considering.  I think it's one of the best restaurants within a mile, all things considered.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"No, there's a ton of hype on this place. The place looks like it should be making the hippest tastiest food in town. And the menu makes everything look incredible in the way it describes the dishes. But unfortunately, it's really not all that. I went with B and we had four bland, poorly prepared, misidentified dishes that the waiter strongly recommended. We kept wondering if we had ordered the wrong things, but four for four is a pretty good indicator. The lamb that B got that claimed to be ""encrusted"" was actually fried in breadcrumbs. My pork that claimed to be ""maple glazed"" was brushed on the top with a glaze but had zero flavor underneath the surface of it. The brussels sprouts were big and undercooked. Feh.  When we got there, it was less than one third full but the server put us at the ""chef's counter"" because we didn't have reservations. We left an hour later and it was still half full. Thanks a lot :p The service was otherwise very good--nice and positive waiter.  A cash-only BYOB? Already a warning sign.  The place across the street (where 20 Manning used to be) is perfectly fine. Go there. Audrey Claire is loud, uncomfortable, and not worth the time or wait.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Bertucci's never gets old.  I've eaten at this particular location many times over the past 10 years.  The service has always been good as is the food.  My personal favorite is the grilled salmon, which comes with mashed potatoes and asparagus, though the four-cheese ravioli is pretty good.  Oh, and the freshly baked dinner rolls that come with olive oil for dipping.....the best part!!  Many times I run into people I know there, though that happened more in high school because a number of my friends worked there.  Be forewarned, it tends to get crowded, especially on weekends, so I highly recommend calling ahead and getting your name on the list.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Well, this place is a college pizza place. That means a few things:   - there's a lot of grease   - it's cheap   - it is located conveniently near a college  Greasy pizza can be good, however, and for the price Renato's comes through. Certainly better than the alternatives, and if you opt for the pricier options (read: buffalo chicken), you can get a quality pizza for cheap.  Things to avoid:      mushrooms - not even close to fresh. Unappetizing.     trying to call after 11:30 - unfortunately the village of Swarthmore doesn't allow Renato's to be open after midnight  Things to get:     the Chicken Parmesan sub - most underrated item, delicious     sausage pizza     bacon and tomato pizza     buffalo chicken pizza  Again, you get what you pay for, but Renato's is good compared to Acapulco's and cheap compared to Peace A Pizza or Swarthmore Pizza.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This place was great! One of the best places to eat in the area. The corn pudding was surprisingly good, the fries were good. My group enjoyed the chicken, ribs, and the pulled pork.

"My sons loves this place and request their pizza every time we visit his grandparents. It actually better pizza than some (supposedly) famous places in NJ.   I've never really had anything but pizza, but others in my family have, and everyone enjoys it all.  Even as a vegan, I order cheeseless pizza and it's very good: their sauce and crust are good enough on their own, even without toppings.   The only warning for new visitors is that it can get very crowded on weekends. You may have to wait; instead, I always pickup to avoid the wait.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Had a fantastic lunch today. First time there went on Yelp reviews and the 4 stars were right on. I was very impressed, the servers were very friendly and gave us great service. I shared a two meat plate with salad and bake beans, chicken and brisket. The chicken had an excellent taste, a hint of smoke flavor. Very moist and tender perfectly cooked. The same for the brisket, the beans were really good and a little side salad was perfect. It was a perfect amount to share and very reasonable priced. Will make this a regular weekend stop when on that side of town. Update Had another fantastic lunch , always delicious and friendly employees.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Pho 75 is only good if all you want is a big bowl of noodles (no appetizers), but their soup is really good! The staff is very attentive, and the food arrives quickly. Their sprouts, peppers, lime, and basil are very fresh, and they somehow manage to keep their condiment containers decently clean.

"I went there for the first time with a large group of friends, not knowing what to expect. It was a pleasant evening, so we selected outdoor seating. We both had the Texas Tea cocktail without the extra shot of alcohol and found it to be just the right mix of sweet and lemony. It's a fairly large drink and one was enough for us. Patrons are restricted to two of these babies because of the alcohol content, so keep that in mind when ordering them. I had a small sirloin steak(6 oz.) with a loaded baked potato and fresh steamed broccoli and hubby had Chicken Alfredo. My steak was fine, cooked perfectly and surprisingly was not chewy. The Alfredo was as good as it gets when not ordered from an authentic Italian restaurant. The party was large enough for me to not remember what everyone else ordered, but everyone was pleased with their choices, all food was consumed, and nothing was sent back to the kitchen for any reason. Two members of my party had dessert, the rest of us were too full. They ordered the Key Lime Pie and said it was wonderful. I can attest that it looked wonderful, so much so, that I took a photo of it as they dug in. The prices are quite reasonable, most items are $12 and under, and they give nice portions.its definitely a great family place. i look forward to eating there again!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Don't let the location deter you from coming here--the food is very good. The tandoori chicken was very flavorful and moist, and the naan and rice were great. The vegetable dishes we got had a little too much black pepper flavor for me but besides that they were good. I like that the butter chicken was in thinner strips instead of chunks, letting the flavor soak into the meat better. Waiters are incredibly attentive and accommodating. Would highly recommend having lunch or dinner here. The buffet was not offered when we went but I would want to try it in the future.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Never had a problem before with delivery notification until today and the food is good. Delivery man pulls up and leave white paper bag on my front step. Did not call, text, ring bell or knock on door to inform me he was here. My front door was open with the screen security door locked. I saw the car pull up,  the delivery guy couldn't see me where I was inside my house, but by the time I got to the door, I move slow at 67, he had left the bag with my food on my front step. He was getting back in car. ""I said hey, you were going to leave my food on the step? He said"" that's our procedure due to covid"". I called him back over to hand him a $5 tip despite this lack of customer service. I called the store, the answerer was unpleasant, overtalked me and tried to dispute that I had observed this behavior.. then told me that the guy was going to text me AFTER he got back in the car to let me know my food was on the step. That makes absolutely NO SENSE! I told him that was not the process with my past deliveries. Very poor customer service and inadequate response to my concern.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"The food in this small, strip mall restaurant is good and the menu is broad. More Americanized than some Korean restaurants I've been to, but authentic enough to make the four of us happy. The setting is nothing of note, and one feels that the previous tenant, another Korean restaurant I was told, is still haunting the walls and tables; or perhaps that's just a bit of grease needing to be cleaned away. The service was adequate but not overly friendly, which is the norm for Korean restaurants. Our waitress might not have offered us refills on our drinks, but she did take time to answer questions.The barbecued meat dishes were particularly tasty and my wife loved her seafood pancake. Our friend's chicken katsu chicken was not noteworthy. The potato croquette appetizer was tasty and I liked the veg sushi. My wife, however, thought it a bit salty. The six side dishes offered varied from very good, particularly the dried seaweed, to uninteresting such as al dente potatoes, to stuff I don't eat, like traditional kimchee. If you enjoy Korean and don't want to feel overly challenged but do want to be well fed, this is a good choice. And, the prices were quite reasonable given the large portions.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"We've gone and had the buffet twice and I have to say although it's not the best Chinese food you'll ever have, it's very decent Americanized Chinese buffet food. Especially here in Tucson, where there's a lack of good Chinese buffets.   The food is always hot and fresh. The benefit of having smaller portions in the buffet line is that new trays come out constantly, after all, you don't want the food sitting there for hours on end, even if it's in abundance.   Yes, the buffet is small, but what it lacks in size, it makes up in quality.   The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We came in with a party of 10, they set up tables for us, which given the small space is quite a feat, and didn't bat an eyelash when 2 more showed up to our party and we asked for separate checks.   Quite a nice little gem on the eastside, we'll be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I've always wanted to eat here, but some how always go to Bern's for all our special occasions. As a matter of fact since we're going to Bern's this Monday to celebrate our son's Birthday we decided to make a reservation and celebrate Valentine's Day here at Donatello.   Well I'm glad we did. The food and service were well worth the price for dinner. The quality of the food is first class. This restaurant has charm.   We started with salmon di scozia affumicato, then I had the minestrone allá milanese, the wife pasta e fagioli allá romana and for entree I had the linguine al granchio, and she had scaloppini di Vitelli allá Sicilia. We each had a glass of wine. I cheated and also had an Amstel Light. It was ice cold. We finished with each of us having expresso.   The coffee was served while my wife went to the restroom, and one of the servers took her coffee away and told me he would make a another one for her when she returned so it would be nice and hot.  What service. He happened to be Cuban from basically the same hometown as my wife. He also had attended Cujae, Polytechnic Jose Antonio Echeverría, which is a university specializing in Engineering. My wife's family in Cuba also are trained engineers having attended this university.   As a matter of fact her cousin, who graduated from this university, became the President of the Cuban Telephone Company.  If this wasn't enough while I was eating my son texted and asked if the owner, Gino Tiozzo, was there. Apparently, he attended Jesuit HS with my son. My son explained they weren't friends at Jesuit , but a mutual friend Noel Cruz was.   Anyway, being a New Yorker, I asked and found Gino before we left. Being a restauranteur he keeps in touch with Noel Cruz, a close friend of my son. Noel owns Ichicoro Restáurant here in Tampa and Gino raved about it. Gino was so gracious in having a picture taken of us.   Sorry I given so much information. Anyway, Gino is a true gentleman and Donatello is an outstanding restaurant.

I came here for brunch with two of my friends. It was  such a great time. I will say we had to wait around although there were plenty of empty tables. I was pretty irritated at first until the host finally said they were short staffed that's why they were only sitting in certain tables. Our waitress made up for the wait. Although they were slammed she kept an update attitude with a smile on her face. We all opted for the unlimited brunch and its totally worth it. The menu is unlimited on Sunday's from noon until 4pm. There was also a house dj who was amazIng. The food was delicious. The mimosas were good too. I definitely recommend the raspberry mimosa.

Excellent selection of both wine AND spirits, great values as well as high end stuff, and (most important to me) very friendly and knowledgeable staff.

"My husband and I ate here on Saturday night after returning from our trip. We were staying at the Wyndam Garden Hotel and needed someplace close to eat at since we were both pretty tired. Being in Philly, we both decided to try their Philly cheese steak. We also started the meal out with an order of onion rings. They were incredible! The batter on them was just right and they were served with a dipping sauce very similar to the Bloomin Onion dipping sauce at TGI Fridays. The cheese steaks were also very tasty and we both enjoyed them. The downside? The terrible service. Our waitress never came back over to check on us during the meal or to refill our drinks. I finally flagged down another waitress to ask for refills and she acted as if this was the biggest deal. Meanwhile, our table was not more than 5 feet from the soda fountain. I almost got up and filled my drink up myself. The food was really good, but poor service from uninterested waitresses really puts a damper on my meal.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
