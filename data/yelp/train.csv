"I ended up here on a whim and what a whim it turned out to be.  This place turned out to be great.  I ended up trying out the Tacos al Pastor.  Great call Rick.  What did you like most about them?  I loved that they were small, tasty, not covered up with sour cream/guacamole and reminded me of eating fresh tacos from little Mexican stands.  The taste of the pork was the main flavor here.... like it's supposed to be.    What did I love most about this place?  Tell us Rick.... You don't HAVE to have beans and rice... You can if you would like still though.   You get a choice of sides.... What a novel idea.  I went with the rajas con crema (just ok in my book) and the quesadillita de jalapenos (pretty damn good in my book), but come on people... you can choose from 15-17 sides.    The patio is nice.  The service pretty good.  The guy kept our water glasses full as we baked outside in the warm sun.  All of this taken into account... 2 thumbs up Senor.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"DISCLAIMER: I've never been to the Acme on Iberville, So I don't have anything to compare this to. I was staying right next to it & it was definitely on my list of places to get to but they had a long line one morning so I never went. Imagine my surprise when I saw an ACME in the casino later that night.   I can't say if it was better or worse than the Iberville location but it was pretty damn good. The ambience was perfect for what we were there for (sports bar vibe more than fast food - but better food than most if not all sports bars I've been to). Food came out quick for me, didn't experience some of the things I read in the reviews after I ate there.    I order the sampler.. jambalaya, gumbo, red beans and rice were all FIRE! Not afraid to use seasoning, felt like I was eating at home.  I would recommend this place for the sampler at least, and I would stop by again if I'm in the casino. However, I think next time I'll give the Iberville appt a shot.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Since we were in Dunedin, we needed to grab ourselves some kind of food for the first meal of the day  - I know, I know, we should have eaten earlier, but oh well.   We've tried to eat here a few times, but parking has -always- been a nightmare. Today was almost no exception, except someone was pulling out from one of the front spaces.  The parking around the building is tight, not a lot of spaces for a place that has plenty of room indoors and out, I'm guessing that they park in the municipal lot across the street. And YES, Survey, there is BIKE parking.   Once we were sat, outside, since the day was nice, our server came right away. I was kind of worried because most of the complaints were about the service. Our girl, I don't remember her name, was on point. The husband was looking for a ""sour beer or Lambec"" but sadly they had neither. He ended up getting a cider. I opted for a tea.  We began our meal with their Horsey Deviled Eggs and they were absolutely delicious. A touch on the salty side, but a good note to start the meal on.   For our Mains, I had the Pulled pork on Texas toast with a side of Mac & Cheese, and the husband had their Heart attack on brioche. Both of us were surprised at the size of the servings. My meat was over flowing off the toast! It was a generous portion, sauced nicely, with a side of sauce.  The Mac and cheese, while tasty was barely warm. That was kind of a disappointment.   The Heart Attack on brioche looked incredible: 2 huge slabs of good beef, topped with 2 different cheeses, and some brisket that was nice and smoky with a side of cole slaw with mango. The husband said that the brisket added a really rich flavor to the food, but was almost on the edge of over powering. The slaw was -good-. You might think the mango might be TOO sweet, but no, it was perfect.   And we indulged in dessert: The Banana bread pudding. It was a delightful concoction of Fried banana, bread pudding with cinnamon and chocolate chips - such a good addition - with Caramel and Chocolate sauce.  This came arranged on a plate with strawberries, whipped cream and both sauces. Dear god, this was amazing on the tongue, and one dessert was surely enough for 2 people.   I'll be back, that's for sure. We really enjoyed our experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Pretty sure we just found our new local go-to place for Japanese food now that Numa is closed.   Came here out of curiosity after nabbing a Groupon. The sushi was great quality, service was prompt and friendly, prices were VERY reasonable, and the variety of rolls on the menu is dizzying.   We got ... a lot of food. Something like 6 rolls, additional sushi a la carte and soup -- and the bill (before groupon) was only $60. You cannot beat that. (That it's a BYOB helps.)   We'll definitely be back.

"Well, I hope you're not in a rush. Ordered take out and waited about 25 minutes. There was more staff than patrons in the restaurant. Unfortunately, they did get one of the orders completely wrong. When we called to alert them, they passed the phone around, but ultimately handled it satisfactorily. Won't let this taint my impression. Next time, I'll just dine in when I'm not in too much of a hurry.  Now, you may be asking yourself, ""Why then 4 stars?"" Because my sandwich (which was correct) was amazing. A tomato mozzarella on some kind of foccasia. And the cupcake I got my grandparents was a big hit. I can't wait to try the loaf I took home.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Definitely a solid place to get Mexican food. I usually get the burrito platter that includes a burrito, beans and rice. Very generous portions. Also, I always order my burrito topped with queso (white cheese dip), which makes it muy delicioso! I've also had the nachos, which are awesome as well. I just really like the tex-mex flavor of everything here.  I love that there is a drive-thru option. This is great for when you're in a hurry, or you want to bring the food home to eat during your favorite show, or you have a strong craving to gorge on mexican food but don't have anyone to go to the restaurant with you. But BEWARE! Everything is ala carte at Nachomamas. So if you're like me and looking to order an entree, sides of beans and rice, chips and salsa and/or gauc and/or cheese dip (did I mention I LOVE mexican food and when I eat it, I don't mess around), be prepared to spend $15-20! This came as quite a shock to me when I made my first drive-thru visit. Most Mexican places include complimentary chips and salsa for take-out orders. I wish they did that here.  I've also visited Nachomamas a few times and dined in the restaurant. It is a little on the small side, but I've never had an issue finding a table. It is the type of restaurant that you go up and order and then get your food at the counter after it is ready. The advantage of eating inside the restaurant is that they have a salsa and toppings bar, so you can load your food up with all the salsa, cilantro, onions, or jalepenos you want, without being charged extra for those items like you would on a drive-thru order.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"So we finally made it to 55S and let me say it was worth the wait!  We started with guacamole. Now, $10 for one avocado and mix-ins is a bit steep, but the hot tortilla chips are sturdy enough to take it by the spoonful.  For the record, my wife loved the guac.  I had the cochinita and it was ridiculous! The pork had a lot of flavor to it and I couldn't stop talking 'bout the rice! Yes, the rice had enough flavor to stand alone as a dish...not just a thoughtless side-filler you eat after all your main dish was gone. The tortillas that accompanied my dish were great to break apart and fill with the pork and completely sink into the orange mojo sauce. Very good!  My wife had the shrimp with tequila cream sauce over corn tamal.  She wouldn't share any shrimp with me, which tells me they were cooked very well.  The cream sauce was very tasty and the corn tamal added a sweetness to her dish.  It is a bit pricy- $70 for 2 (each of us had 1 drink). But the atmosphere and wait staff made for an overall good experience.  Sam, our server gave solid recommendations and was pretty good with our service.  We hit our timing perfectly, walked right in and got a table in the bar just before several large groups arrived.  So no wait either!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"A friend and I ventured to Mass Ave last night for meatballs and it was great. I expected it to be good, but it was even better than my expectations. We were seated right away which my friend said it was because we were ""Mass Ave Early""! It was about 6.30 when we got there for dinner.  Our waitress explained everything to us in great detail and then we were set with our sharpies.... I had to suppress my laugh at each time she said ""balls"" (I'm a urology nurse.... So I deal in a lot of balls). Anyway.... Onto the food..  We both each ordered the 4 baller plate. I got two classic meatballs (sausage/beef) with the spicy sauce, one veggie ball with spicy cilantro, & one special with marinara. I'm totally surprised that my favorite was the veggie with spicy cilantro. We also split the pasta with queso cheese... Which was good, but since I also had a salad before hand I wasn't much in the mood for more food.   Definitely plan on coming back... Another great addition to Mass Ave!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Luciana's is pretty much what you think of when you think of a Mexican restaurant in the Indy area and is very similar (in my opinion) to Cancun. Their food is very tasty, and I've never gotten anything that I didn't like. The food is also hot and fresh from the kitchen. I like their salsa on the table and their guacamole is also really good!  They do have decent drink specials, and their margaritas usually go down a bit too easily ;). I think the most I've had to wait for a table is just a few minutes, and their service is really fast and friendly.   The only problem I seem to have when coming here for a meal is to find a parking spot! Their front lot is usually full, but you can get lucky by going around back or finding a spot on the adjacent street. Overall, a pretty decent place to get your Mexican fix with good food & drinks, and reasonable prices.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"What a charming little brunch place this is. This is another place I found the via Yelp that I never would have found on my own. I've driven past this strip mall lots of times and had no idea that tucked in a back corner was such a nice little restaurant. I did my research the night before by looking at their menu. When I got there I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were other choices available such as chocolate chip pancakes and banana pancakes. I had not had banana pancakes in a long time but now I can see myself ordering them regularly because they were delicious! From the western omelette, to the pancakes, to the scrambled eggs we liked everything that we were given. The prices were quite reasonable as well. What's nice is that they have lunch items as well as breakfast items so you can get whatever you are in the mood for anytime of the day they are open.  The breakfast choices include items you might not always see on breakfast menus such as crepes and quiches.  There's also nine different types of omelets.  For lunch you could get a hamburger or something more exotic such as Sheperd's Pie.  I want to try more things from their menu but it's going to be hard to say 'no' to those banana pancakes!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I have to say that the banh mi tasted better than average banh mi that I have tried so far in this area, but I wouldn't say it's the best I've tasted. I ordered the rice combination with sliced pork and I really enjoyed that dish. The pork was perfectly seasoned, the over-easy egg was cooked perfectly, and the meatloaf was flavorful. The fried tofu bean curd was unfortunately a little over cooked, but still tasted alright. I would recommend the rice pork combination. The fresh spring rolls were good.   Service was good; waters were refilled multiple times, food came out in reasonable time, and we were checked on regularly. Only downside is that this place accepts only cash.

"We were looking for a decent hamburger to enjoy on the 4th and stumbled upon GSE. I enjoyed the simpler, not too frilly menu. I ordered a farmhouse bacon & cheeseburger with blue cheese instead of american, the village fries with rosemary, thyme and sea salt and shared a mini shake with my husband.  The ordering process was smooth and the wait time was not super long which was great! The burger was cooked medium well which was perfect for me and had a nice piece of bacon and a good hunk of cheese! They did originally forget to put on he lettuce, tomato, onions and pickles but I was able to get all but the pickles when I went down to the counter to get the missing toppings! I would have rated them a five but since they forgot the pickles twice I was a little sad since they're my favorite! The burger was tasty though even without them!   The fries were tasty and the speciality mayo sauces really made them spectacular - they had a bunch of flavors including mango, sriacha, chipotle and old bay. The chipotle sauce was amazing but I would recommend skipping the old bay unless you're a huge fan as it was overwhelming for me.  Overall I would recommend visiting and will definitely return myself for a quick and delicious burger and fries!  I would skip on the shake next time but for those that love a creamy milkshake it might be worth a try since they have a unique set of flavors",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

It's nice that they include a small salad and soup with your order, most Chinese restaurants won't do that.   Prices were good too (for lunch), atmosphere was fine. But the women who work there need to brush up on their English pronunciation, had a hard time understanding them.  Update 5/30: the weather is warming up, and so is this restaurant. No air conditioning in there...  They just leave the door open. Without a/c, and with a crowd of customers, as well as the heat from the kitchen, it can get pretty warm in there.

We had a very friendly server, and the rest of the staff was very attentive, not letting our water glasses get less than half full at any point during our meal.   We started with seared tuna, which sat atop an avocado-cranberry mixture. It sounds strange, but the cranberry gave the tuna a new flavor that really worked, and the tuna could not have been any fresher as it was flown in from Hawaii today.   For my entree, I had Hot Chicken, and it was the most juicy and tender chicken I have ever had. The spice level was mild (I would have preferred it kicked up a notch or three), and it was served over bacon with crispy kale strips on top. My Mom had the special, which was the most delectable lightly fried trout topped with a sweet and spicy Thai chili sauce. I admit to entree envy, although my chicken was great. The sides came served for the table and were a farrow salad, mango and kiwi chutney and spicy cremini mushrooms. I loved the mushrooms and chutney while my Mom's favorite was the farrow.

I was surprised by the large serving of shrimp tempura, we couldn't even finish it. The shrimp were delicious with an amazing sauce over.  The rolls were fresh and delicious.  The service began slow, took about 8 minutes for someone to get us drinks and tell us about specials, but then we had three people checking on us thoroughly the night.  It was a very busy Friday night.  We forgot wine, but were offered complimentary sangria...we had to glasses each, it was delicious.

"What is most likely due to customer demand, a second Poco & Mom's is serving Tucson. It is also on Tucson's East side, but closer to those in the Foothills and the Tanque Verde area.  I found the service here much better than the original location. I'm not saying the first location is bad (service was pretty good), but the servers here had more of a welcoming  attitude.   The interior and architectural design is unique. I can see why it can be a little tricky finding where the front entrance is located. When you walk in at the front entrance (which is right across from the GTX Training), you are right at the Catina. You will be asked if you here just to dine, and then they'll ask if that's the section you'd like to be seat. You go through a narrow hallway into the main dining section. It is very open and spacious, and there is patio seating. The lone bathroom is in the middle of this hallway, and even though it just serves one person, you can watch the Chefs make food through the window...very cool! Additional bathrooms are upstairs where a local newspaper has their office.   The food is very comparable to their original location and was delicious! I enjoy the fact that they use shredded chicken for their chicken burritos. The salsa for the chips goes very well with it! The bean and cheese burrito was very tasty but wished the cheese was melted when served.   Poco & Mom's is another great hole-in-the-gem in the Tucson area, and now has two locations that dish out great food!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"For our second year anniversary, my fiance and I decided to celebrate with dinner at Lacroix.  Food: 4.5 stars We decided to create our own tasting menu with the A La Carte Menu instead of going with the chef's tasting.  We started out with a half dozen Oysters which were presented as half east coast and half west coast varieties.  The oysters were delicious.  We followed up with the Lobster and Ribeye which were each equally delicate, delicious, and made of high quality ingredients.  I would highly recommend the surf and turf style tasting menu at the restaurant.  As far as the drinks, the cocktails are innovative.  I would highly recommend the CIROC Cocktail.  My fiance ordered it and after I tried it, I had 2 more of my own.  They were far stronger than my initial Agave Nectar Margarita.  Dessert... Don't miss the Grand Marnier Soufflé.  Unbelievable and worth the 15-20 min prep time.   Location: 4.0 stars Overlooking Rittenhouse Park, Lacroix has great location.  However, it fails to reach its potential in reaching out to the clientele which Parc, Devon, and Rouge pull.  The restaurant was empty on a Friday night at 10 pm.  Ambiance: 3.5 stars The restaurant is well decorated and beautiful but obviously is lacking business.  Is it because its too hoity-toity? Probably.  An empty restaurant is nice but a busy, fun atmosphere is better.  Service: 5.0 stars Service was incredibly on point.  Price: 3.5 stars With dinner, drinks, dessert, expect to pay $50-100 per person.   Overall: 4.0 stars Food and Service were incredible.  The prices are steep and the emptiness of the restaurant prevent it from being a 5 star experience.  Still, a great way to celebrate our 2nd Anniversary.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I actually like the buffet at Panda King. Why? They have Garlic Eggplant. That's all I need.  They do have a huge selection of other chinese-american fare. Keep in mind, it is a buffet, so it's going to be buffet-quality. Compared to others in the area, though, it's of higher quality and a much larger, varied selection of food.  I just wish they would put some spicy peanut sauce with the vietnamese spring rolls... however, I've found the leftover garlic sauce from the Eggplant is pretty good for a dip :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

But I was surprised at the $38 price tag as typically that brand is around $29.

"Street Side has been in my bookmarked folder for some time now and on a hot Saturday afternoon in July we made our way over to Girard. Street Side is a little hard to find and a little nondescript. The place is located across the street from Paesano's and almost next door to Moda Mia. The restaurant is trendier then most Viet places inside and it has a younger feel. There is seating downstairs and also upstairs. It is very casual and clean.  We were sort of in between lunch and dinner so we ordered a few things to be shared by 3 people. The Lemon Grass Bahn Mi, Garlic Shrimp Spring Roll, the traditional paper wrap and combo brisket Pho. Everything was really good and tasted fresh. The Bahn Mi bread was excellent. The Pho broth was light but still flavorful. I had an ice coffee, which hit the spot on a hot day, and we also tried the citrus coconut and cucumber drink and honey basil seed drink. Both of these were refreshing. We ended our meal happily with Asian sugar doughnuts and Coconut pudding. All of this was about $36.00. Not too bad at all for the quality and freshness of the food.  Definitely going back to Street side and 4 solid Yelp stars.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I wanted to do an update of this restaurant. I had the privilege of coming back here after being away for a few years down in Houston. Despite Houston having a much larger food scene, their Thai food has been lacking compared to this sweet gem from Nashville, TN.  They fail on three points: authenticity, price, and atmosphere.  One of the things if you are looking for a legit Thai place, is a picture of their King. Even though the King is now deceased, truly legit hole-in-the-walls will have a picture or calendar of him up on the wall. They used to, but I'm not sure if they do anymore.  When I first went here, they had the rotary fans blowing, a slightly warm atmosphere--very Thai. They've done some renovations to the place to make it more spiffy, but it feels a little less authentic than it used to, but still pretty close!  The other thing to be aware of is that there are many restaurants that are Laotian owned, and not Thai owned. While the difference is subtle, the native Thai tongue can taste the difference. This place, at least used to, be Thai owned, and Thai cooked. That, and that little four-piece container that has the spices, vinegar, fish sauce, etc. is the Thai flavor balancer. That's a must of a legit Thai restaurant.   Lastly, the price point was always spot on. I could go here, and leave with Pad Thai coming out of my ears for under $8. The prices have changed a little bit, but this place has settled so deeply into my heart that I knew it deserved a more in depth review. If you're in Nashville, definitely come by here.  The staff, the atmosphere, the authenticity, the price are all reasons to fall in love with this place!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Came here again for a dinner date on Friday, March 16th. We had a really great time and loved our food.   We made a reservation about 20 minutes before we arrived and were seated right away.  Tip: if you come before 6:30pm you can order the $5.00 Happy Hour martinis that they serve in the lounge. You can order them directly from your waiter and he'll shake and pour them for you. Much nicer than having to balance the glasses between the bar and the table, which we had to do when we ate a the sushi restaurant. I had a hard time deciding amongst their 200+ martinis, and the waiter offered that if I ordered something I didn't like, I could get something else! Love that!  What we had:  Bread: Prefer the sourdough bread over the cheddar biscuits, which were kind of dry.  Appetizers: Oysters (delicious and from the Pacific Northwest, which are our favorite) ""Famous"" Mushroom Ravioli (they were pretty good, not as great as I had expected)  Main course:  Lamb (loved, loved, loved.  Did I mention, loved?) Roasted chicken (very good. huge serving and had leftovers. wished they were served with more veggies because they were especially delicious)  Dessert: Specialty fruit souffle (normally I prefer the chocolate souffle, but I'm so glad we tried something different and got this. It was unbelievably good and I'd order it again).  We were there from 5:30pm-8pm. The service was great. The restaurant was quiet and romantic. The only downside was that about 15 minutes before we were done a large party came in celebrating St. Patrick's Day. They were extremely loud, obnoxious, and we could no longer hear each other speak. If we weren't almost done eating I would have been furious.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
This is the best place to get steak in the area. The meat always taste fresh like it just came from the cow and the price is good for what you get.

"The setting:  It's right across from the Eastern State Eastern State Penitentiary on the corner of 21st and Fairmount. I came here when it was Mugshots Coffeehouse and fell in love with the decor. My sister lives close by and suggested it for lunch. OCF renovated the look and expanded it as well. It's a very open space, modern, and lots of natural light. Long tables for bigger parties, private seating to have alone time or group seating which was perfect for us. A nice sitting environment to chat with friends over good eats, a cup of tea/coffee or to read/study. There were people casually sitting with their notes, laptop or books with a drink. They have a community calendar which was nice to see. It provides a sense of caring for the community. The specials for the day were listed on a board upon entering which was a nice summary in addition to the menus and the board above the counter. The desserts were cased by the registers and all looked scrumptious! The tea - never saw so many options in one place for consumption! I definitely will have to try the coffee next time, we came for lunch.    The Food:  Their food is pretty darn good taste-wise and health-wise! Their options are generally local, grass-fed, or organic, gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options, which we appreciated. It felt really great knowing that we were eating well without breaking our wallets and the best part was that everything was delicious too. We ordered the Power Salad, Roasted Vegetable Sandwich - that came yummy veggie (terra) chips, a vegan peanut butter cookie that you will LOVE I promise even if you are not vegan (which we aren't), and a peanut butter cake with chocolate ganache which we split as well and all enjoyed!  I would definitely recommend OCF, the staff were all ready and willing to answer any question we had. They offered suggestions based on questions they asked and they were so pleasant.

"One of our go-to burger places in Tucson. I'm partial to this location, because I'm generally never disappointed here. The one on Grant is a hit or miss... So when we have time, we come to this one.  I've explored all of the burgers on the menu, and my favorite is still the Breakfast Burger, Medium. The Ahi Tuna Salad is delicious too. I can't eat tuna completely raw, so I get them seared a little bit longer. I don't know what it is, but I can't do it with tuna. Eh.   The boyfriend gets the Kobe Burger, NEVER FAIL, every single time. Medium. Add bacon. So yum. It's too much meat for me (HAH, sorry...), but I do loved the flavor it gives off.   TRUFFLE FRIES ! A must. We'll share Sweet Potato Fries from time to time too, but we have to remember to order them extra crispy otherwise they get soggy quickly.   If I have room to spare (meaning, if I only ate half my burger), I'll order a shake. The ones that are on the menu are always good, but the flavor of the month (week? I don't remember) is normally really yummy too. My favorite so far was the Butterfingers one they had a few months ago. Mmmmm...  You guys should add mac&cheese to your menu too !

Such is the way of things I suppose when you are trying to appeal to as many people as possible. Their food is still really good though. We ordered their adobado tacos, guac, quesadilla, pasilla chile stuffed with pork and cheese, and horchata. It was the perfect amount for the two of us, though we could definitely have eaten more. The flavors are authentic here, they even have freshly made tortillas done within view while waiting to order. Pretty awesome. The prices are cheap and service is pretty quick.

We may have enjoyed it a bit too much given the state we were all in upon leaving the restaurant. I ordered the Spanakopita appetizer for lunch. It was light and flaky and the spinach filling was really tasty. My only complaint is that I wish it had been slightly crispier. Another friend ordered the dolmeh appetizer and was also very pleased. The sauce was rich and had good flavor. The flavor wasn't quite what one would normally expect in dolmeh, but was still very pleasant. The chef even included a cabbage roll for some variety. Our third friend had a shrimp and tomato dish with feta cheese baked on top. It was brought out still sizzling in a cast iron skillet. The cheese was addictively salty and the shrimp were full of flavor. Lunch included complimentary baklava, which was oozing with honey and deliciousness. Overall we were very pleased.

If I go again I might order a cold appetizer so we can try the pita, but the bread they gave us was good- i dipped it in the leftover oil from the octopus which was tasty.

They offer a better dining experience as opposed to the ones located in the mall's fast food court.  A unique thing offered at the sit-ins are the bento boxes, which consists of the rice or noodles, california rolls, gyoza (dumplings), then your choice of chicken, beef, or shrimp (or any of those combinations) with vegetables. This is a really filling meal and I definitely enjoy the bento box layout. Of coarse you can still order traditional dishes like teriyaki chicken or sukiyaki beef, which are also very satisfying. I like the addition of sushi-only dishes. Their rolls are prepared fresh and my portions of california rolls were more fillings instead of rice...which I loved but definitely filled me up quickly.

Only reason it doesnt get 5 stars is because their waiting set up is a litlle discombobulated.  This is def one of our regular go to spots!

"We went on a slow Sunday as they opened after church. We ordered a the bruschetta trio to start, a small cheese pizza (no kids menu) and the Don (meat lovers).  The bruschetta were all decent with the original being the best. Very fresh and good bread.  The small cheese was a little underwhelming, but decent.  The Don was to die for. One of the best meat lovers that I have had in this area.  The only loss of a star is based on price. $24 for a medium pizza is steep!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Visiting New Orleans for a half marathon and needed to ""carb"" up before the race. Did a quick search of Italian restaurants around us and Katie's had pretty good reviews. Didn't realize that everyone and their mothers were waiting to eat at this place. The wait was an hour! .  Well, I guess we wait then. There wasn't any place to wait inside so we waited outside and it was freezing.   After just about an hour and I went in to see where we were on the list. I was told we were next. Clearly ""next"" doesn't mean what Webster's dictionary has as next. She came out and called two more parties before calling us.   We were seated at a round table in the middle of the restaurant. It was packed. They really put everything too close together. Anytime anyone walked by, we were having to scoot our chairs in or being bumped.   I ordered angel hair pasta with a garlic cream sauce and added mushrooms and artichoke hearts with Parmesan. I wish there were more of the mushrooms and artichoke hearts so that was disappointing BUT overall the pasta was so freakin yummy. Maybe because I was starving but non the less, it was pretty great. The toasted bread on the side was super good too. You know when you bite into a crustini and you tear the crap out of the roof of your mouth?? Well this was like melt in your mouth the second your teeth bit into it. It was amazing. Light and airy.   Oh yeah....not only was our wait an hour but then it took an hour to get our food. It all seemed excessive. 4 stars just for the taste of the food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I'm giving tupelo 4 stars, but only for the service, not for the food. I came here on Saturday evening with a few of my friends to celebrate a promotion my friend just received, & we remembered tupelo having tasty cocktails so we decided to come here.   Our server Iris was extremely sweet, knew more about the menu than any server I've ever talked to, and helped each of us pick out a drink. (Which made us feel like she actually cared about our dining experience) especially since she seemed to be the only one working the whole restaurant! We actually started to feel bad for her, especially when the girl at the table next to us was being so loud and calling her names. She handled everything very professionally, and even apologized to us that our food came out a little late. We told her we totally understood, (some of us being in the industry), and told her that we have never seen someone handle a whole restaurant so well. She even had a brace on her leg! Poor thing.   We ordered the Trout, Salmon, and a few other small things. The trout had no flavor, (I have had this before in the past and it was excellent). I'm not sure if tupelo has changed cooks or what, but overall the food quality has gone downhill.  (The drinks were great though!) Iris offered to replace the dish with something else, but we told her not to go through the trouble, and just bring us some extra sauce instead. When we were finished, it took a little bit for our plates to get cleared, but again, there was clearly no busser or other help in sight, so how could we possibly get mad at her for that. She then came over and listed the desserts for us. At that point the table next to us was being so loud and obnoxious we didn't really want to sit there any longer. Iris brought us our check and happily let us split it.   I don't normally tip more than 20%, but I did leave more for her. This girl rocked it, handled a practically full restaurant on her own, and with a hurt leg.   I don't know that I would eat here again, but the only thing that would bring me back would be the drinks and the service. You rock Iris!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

So, why can I not give this place five stars? I think it is because it lacks that special something that puts it over the top. the food is good, but I have had better. When you figure in the price it leaves you a little wanting.   My most recent visit, I felt rushed. I was having a leisurely dinner with great conversation and wanted the evening to last. We were done in less than an hour! And I told the waiters I was in ""no hurry."" It just was not leisurely, but rushed. This should not happen in a restaurant like this..

"I have to give these guys credit. Late last night (after 10), I put in an order for a Mediterranean veggie sandwich without cheese and lava cakes. When I got my food,  I opened the sandwich and was dismayed to find that they had ignored my instructions and that I couldn't eat the sandwich.  I decided not to call because 1) I didn't know how much longer they were open, and 2) the delivery girl was especially wonderful despite the late hour. I decided just to leave negative feedback using the online form. Within about 40 minutes, I received a phone call. I didn't answer, but I checked the message right away, and it was the manager of this store. He apologized, saying he personally had made my sandwich and it was his fault he wasn't paying attention to what he was doing. He was sending over another sandwich, AND a free order of lava cakes to make up for it. About 15 minutes later, I got another call that I did answer- it was the manager again. He wanted to make sure I was still awake before he sent someone over. Despite the late hour (by now it was about 11:30), this store, and especially its manager, provided me with WONDERFUL customer service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

To sum it up, the sushi is melt in your mouth amazing with loads of choices but the service was dismally dismally dismal!  Granted it was Friday night of Restaurant Week...but 1 hour before appetizers and miso soup is unheard of. And our waitress only really apologized for the wait at the end of the night (3hrs after we arrived) when she brought us the check. I guess that's what the power of tipping is for.

"Being a Chicagoan, when I first heard there was a Harold's in Indianapolis I was not interested in trying it to say the least. Mainly because I felt like no one can do Harold's better than Chicago but also because it was a far distance for me to not know if it was worth it or not.   I learned of the Broad Ripple location opening and it's less than 10 minutes from me so I decided to go.   The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how clean it is (not always the case in Chicago) and they were playing jazz music which I thought was a nice touch.   They had a nice amount of staff which I was happy about who were very professional and because I called my order in, it was ready for me. I chose to dine in and I was pleasantly surprised at how much seating they have (rarely the case in Chicago).   I ordered the 1/4 dark meal and two 2 wing dinners for my children. I asked for salt, pepper and mild sauce on mine (the same way I order in Chicago) my only complaint is that there was not enough salt, pepper and sauce as you can see in my picture. I got extra on the side and I was very happy to find that the sauce is identical to what I'm used to.   Overall I am pleased to say that this Chicagoan can now enjoy a Chicago staple here in Indy!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I visited Bahama Breeze with my son and granddaughter recently and I was pleasantly surprised with the good quality of the service and food.  While Christmas shopping in Clearwater, we needed a break for lunch and visited BB, which was not too busy as others were obviously out shopping.  We ordered the Beef Empanadas for a starter, but my son ate most of them as I was busy playing the table video games with my granddaughter.  Thinking about it now, it was probably a conspiracy between them to rob me of most of the outstanding Beef Empanadas!  As a meal, I had the Seafood Paella, which was excellent.  The seafood was very plentiful and cooked mostly to perfection, the yellow rice was very good, and the price was very reasonable given the quantity and quality of the seafood in the dish.  Finally, the server was personable and efficient, which was greatly appreciated given that there was a 3 year old at the table.  I certainly will be back to Bahama Breeze, but I'll find it very difficult to try other items on their menu as the Beef Empanadas and Paella were so good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

If there is one specialty sandwich I would recommend though, it's the Turkey BLT...the amount of turkey bacon they put in there seems extremely generous.

"Am not familiar with tapas but am a fan of appetizers. We ended up at Fuego after Saturday's wine walk and as so glad that we did. Had read the mixed yelp reviews so it was time to give it a go.   We were a group of four. We ordered the cream based chicken/chorizo soup, Bleu salad and four tapas.... scallops, asparagus straws, jalapenos with bacon [?] and a bean confit-ish dish. All were delicious. Thought I was kind of tapped on alcohol but when the server suggested a sangria I had to do it. Delicious again! Enjoyed the unexpected spicy finish.   The restaurant was very well staffed though our service was a tiny bit spotty... just feels like the FOH is working out the kinks.   The bill, with a generous tip was just under $50. That included three sangiras for the table.   Looking forward to going back and regret not having Fuego closer for lunch!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Aiello's is an unexpected surprise for a pizzeria.  It is somewhat small but they do have several tables inside.  Aside from pizza, they also offer other options such as sandwiches, salads, and pasta.  We came here with a big group and they had no issues accomodating everyone.  For appetizers, we shared some sassy wings and an order of peppadews.  What are peppadews, you ask?  They are mild sweet piquante peppers they claim to have been shipped directly from South Africa stuffed with goat cheese, baked and drizzled with some balsamic vinegar reduction.  The wings were baked and were dry rubbed with seasoning but no sauce.  It was fine but would have preferred some hot or buffalo sauce with the wings. The peppadews were amazing though! I loved the mild spicy flavor of the peppers and the goat cheese.    For the pizza, I tried the house which was topped with italian sausage, bacon, red onions, and green peppers.  It was good but I wish I had saved room for the Greek pizza. I tried a bite and it was really good though meatless.  They have fountain drinks, tea and water.  They also have some wine and beer if you would rather have something alcoholic to go with your food.  Overall, it was a good pizza experience and service was good.

It was really crowded there and since we were a big group they seated us right away in their banquet room upstairs.  Food was delicious. From what I remember, we had the Peking Duck, definitely a must order, fried flounder, some sort of dumpling dish, shrimp, and a spinach dish. I think there was more but nothing beats the Peking Duck and Flounder. For dessert, we got ice cream for the birthday girl.  In the banquet room, there was a karaoke machine. The other party there was using it so we didn't get a chance to try it but they seemed to be having a really good time. Next time, we'll probably try it out.

Just imagine: mussels, jumbo shrimp, and calamari atop of yellow  noodles with a tangy, spicy, and sweet curry coconut sauce with red onions & crispy egg noodles. The portion size is huge & enough for two people. If you come alone, don't fret, this dish makes an awesome leftover meal as well.   The only problem I had was the limited dessert menu.

At first I was looking for a table service place, but this one gave me a good hint that I was going to get something authentic.  I was undecided between gumbo or étouffée and I was happy to hear that I could get both on the same plate! So I had both over white rice.  The chili cheese étouffée had crawfish and was creamy and slightly spicy but delicious. You cannot compare it to a dish made from scratch but it met my expectations.

"Really enjoy seeing shows here! We've been to many plays and concerts over the past few years. Recently we were lucky to see Dave Stanley, an award-winning Western singer-songwriter perform. So glad that Gaslight brings such great talent to these parts of AZ! The laid-back venue w tons of free parking & no traffic is so much more enjoyable for me than jostling to downtown Tucson, Mesa or Phoenix. Very reasonably priced tickets & sometimes twofers offered on their website. Located in an old grocery store set in a small shopping center just north of Rancho Vistoso Blvd, it's easy to overlook- a friend of mine from the neighborhood didn't even know it was there! It's set up as a quasi-dinner theater; 4 seats around a miniature table. A tip would be to buy 4 tickets to share w friends, or take your chances on literally rubbing elbows w some nice strangers. Tables are crowded onto several narrow tiers & a main floor that I think transforms into a dance floor on certain nights - we're looking forward to experience that excitement later this year. Although I'm not a large person, navigating through the sea of tables, people & their outstretched legs is the main drawback for me. On the bright side, the camaraderie garnered by sharing the same pain makes most folks extra friendly. A limited menu is available- if necessary, I would order the pizza, it's really good. We've had most other items on the menu & were pretty disappointed. The ordeal of ordering & eating in such a cramped space is just not worth it for me anymore.

"The roar of trucks on Route 130. A table with a view of creepy old dudes going to the peep show across the Highway. The 1970s decor. No, this isn't a date night spot by any means. What it is, however, is some of the best no-frills Friday night fare you're going to get in Burlington County. The sign was what got my attention - the vintage one out front with Anthony's mug on it, adorned with light bulbs. As soon as I walked in, I knew it was a winner. Anthony himself was at the counter, carefully kneading dough into the pans he prepped for his Sicilian pie. I snagged a slice that had just came out of the oven. Sweet sauce, salty cheese and a light, but crispy crust. Peroni and Coke in bottles to wash it down. It's my normal order. Tonight, however, I strayed. Sure, I got my slices, but I was inspired for some reason to order a cheesesteak. Now I've had my fair share of steaks - Donkey's in Camden, the South Philly stalwarts, the Delco steaks - but this sandwich...unreal. Seasoned beef, the right amount of cheese, perfectly caramelized onions on a damn near perfect roll. The sandwich is a gamer and worth the drive. Like I said, the ambiance is old school.

The layout is in need of an upgrade on decorating, few booths are ripped & have duct tape over them, kinda has a Denny's looking layout, some cheesy floral print splattered about, so if your looking for ambiance; this isn't the place.

Chocolate Chip Waffle - just ok; Big, but very light with a crispy exterior; got soggy fast....not much body.  Pancakes cooked light and fluffy. We tasted the old fashioned buttermilk - ok; Banana Bread with Pecan pancakes were just what you would expect...banana through and through and just like mama's banana bread (of which I am not a fan)....but these were flavorful-good. Buckwheat pancakes - one of my childhood favorites - slightly dense, a bit grainy....delicious flavor with honey or syrup.  Crumbled sausage, mushroom, and sweet, creamy goat cheese omelet. Attractively plated with just a smidgen of filling inside and a pile of the crumbled 'add-ons' n on top. Hash browns - done just right with tender body and a very crispy exterior on one side only. Loved them.  Coffee refills - coming right up!  Best we've ever had? Not quite, and a tad bit on the $$ side, but worth a return visit...and as oft' stated in history, ""I shall return"" (D McArthur), and ""I'll be bock"" (T-800, Model 101).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"i'm so happy to see that krewe du brew's following has grown!  we happened to come across this coffee/tea shop after attending the nearby st. patrick's day parade and needed a little something to cool us down.  from the outside, this shop appears to be in a house.  when you get inside, it's clear that the owner has tried to create a comfortable environment with artwork and books.  there is even a nook that allows you to daydream out the window.  the 1 ""barista"" was so kind to make me a COLD passion tea and after a few minutes asked if i liked it.  the menu may not be very descriptive or inclusive of everything they offer so i would suggest looking at the menu on their web site or asking a few questions - just not too many!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"The Wolf is my favorite pizza I've tried.  The Big Balls (meatball) was a little disappointing -- I didn't think the meatballs had a ton of flavor. The honey wheat crust is very good.  For those of you with a gluten allergy -- they have gluten free crust as well (though I haven't tried it).  Really cool inside atmosphere.  The brick walls make it a little noisy, but not to the point you can't have a conversation. They have a good beer selection (10 drafts, and over 40 bottles) as well. Though I can't bring myself to order anything but a pizza, they do have calzones and oven-baked pasta dishes as well.   Pros: fantastic pizza, good beer selection Cons: can be a bit noisy",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"A new hipster hotspot has been born in the culinary wasteland of the apocalyptic Grant Road Lumber Company. Ping-pong playing, square-bearded porkpie hat aficionados belly up to the bar for their requisite avocado toast (with grilled salmon and an over easy egg, no less), lighter-than-air butternut squash canneloni, or even beer pretzel fondue. Multi-hued hairdos mingle with a befuddled-looking, graying Foothills rubberneckers (some in ill-fitting vee-neck tees to ""fit in"") as a rather self-congratulatory jazz ensemble provides the backbeat. We were thoroughly impressed with the eclectic comfort food-meets dinner standards menu and the playgound warehouse atmosphere, as Sam Fox & Co. know how to navigate the complex tastes of Boomers through Millennials.

Love Bangkok sushi!  You always get so much food for the entrees!  The sushi prices are reasonable too.  Sushi is always yummy whether dining in or taking order togo.  Only con which loses a star is the difficulty in placing an order.  If ordering togo they only have 1 phone line which during busy times is always ringing busy.  Then when you get a ring tone it rings for a long time before you get someone.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

We sat outside and honestly it was one of the best outside patio atmospheres that I have been to.   I ordered the strawberry daiquiri and a chicken chimichanga with added cheddar cheese melted on top. The drink and meal was fantastic. I loved the refried beans and rice. They put the beans in a taco shell and it's a great spin to this classic side. The chimichanga had a perfect blend of moist and crunchy with the deep fried texture. The chips and salsa were great. The chips are homemade and flaky, and the salsa has a good spice to it.   I would not be disappointed if someone suggested Hacienda for dinner.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I was a little overwhelmed by the Carribean flavors of the broth, but the cuts of meat and bits of fish and lobster were divine.

"Delicious Italian Food as Modern Art      My art instructor/guru owed me a favor; he suggested lunch. I went for broke and said dinner--ulterior motive, I needed my ""incomplete"" grade to vanish; wine might help. He suggested the modest BYOB trattoria, Il Fiore, on Collingswood's main street.  I brought a robust red just in case negotiations got tough. As he greeted the receptionist and manager--he requires verbal contact to affirm reality, I began to look for a suitable table--the receptionist said to sit anywhere. I liked her attitude and the cozy room with rugs and tablecloths--notwithstanding the packed-in small tables (big enough for my agenda).        While we shared a Caesar salad, thoughtfully split in the kitchen, Guru enlightened me on lesser known (to me) modern artists. I turned the conversation to ""incompletes."" Gently, he intimated that my knowledge of modern art was somewhat lacking. Really? Guru continued, modern art owes their existence to the late impressionists. I said I liked them--he said, too safe. He asked for my views on the collection at the Phila. Art Museum. Luckily our main courses arrived. Whew. Guru had the shrimp with yummy home-made cheese cavatelli and broccoli rabe in a marinara sauce. I had the bronzini  artistically presented with sautéd shrimp on a bed of spinach and green beans in a light white wine pomodoro sauce.     How Guru could simultaneously eat, think, talk yet have a smile that beams was a mystery to me--probably a subsection of modern art. He said that he could do a lot for my life--I hope that meant a ""complete."" Before I knew it, he had migrated to the Frick Museum (13th to 19th c. art) in NYC. I was distracted by migrating to his plate and comparing our two sauces. He asked if he could try my bronzini and if it were fishy. (?) He tried it and liked it. He doesn't know what I could do for HIS life. As visions of a ""complete"" danced in my head, I poured the rest of the red wine into his glass in lieu of dessert.    On the way back to the car, he gallantly took my arm as we merrily crunched the remains of the icy snow under our feet. I definitely have to brush up my brush-out techniques. ""They"" say that one can remember only 10% of what one hears; make that 2% when it comes to modern art. Hmm...I could entitle my late term paper, ""Delicious Italian Food as Modern Art.""",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The second bite was heaven and every bite after that was just as good.  The potato salad however was a letdown. It tasted great, but the portion was smaller than expected and the potatoes were undercooked and very crunchy. I tried several bites from the portion I was given and they were all the same, undercooked, crunchy, inedible potatoes.

The freshness and quality has always been excellent and consistent.  -Sweet tea is very tasty and their wonton and egg drop soup is good too!  - I had to subtract 1 star from the overall score bc the rest of the items I've ordered (pork dumplings, crab rangoons, scallion pancakes, chicken teriyaki, shrimp teriyaki, and shrimp toast were not very good and average at best.

Neon lights, seizure inducing artificial candles, and giant dragon flags on the ceiling. You read that right, its so crazy. Kinda felt like I was eating dinner in a club. Enough of the bad onto the delicious food.   The food was incredible! We started with the Asian Wonton Nachos. I am a huge fan of nachos and these were some of the best. Topped with all kinds of delicious ingredients, its a sure favorite. For dinner I had the General Tso's Yum Bowl and my girlfriend had the Sesame Chicken Yum Bowl.

Must say, I thought they would mostly concentrate in their beers and maybe one or two quick bites to accompany them, but these guys do put some time and effort into their menu. They offer a wide variety of options for lunch. In the end, we had two burgers, the 15th Street (which I had and loved) and the Black & Bleu (for my wife).

Right off the bat, the decor and setting of the restaurant was very cute and charming. It's a perfect place for night outs with friends or family and they open till late.   I was expecting average Mexican food based on the ratings on Yelp. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I ordered a specialty of the restaurant, the Coconut Shrimp. It was pricey but the dish came out delicious. Everything was cooked to the right texture. Rice was soft, shrimps were so crispy, and veggies were cooked but still had the crunch. The food exceeded my expectation. I also ordered a Margarita and it was good as well, neither watered down nor sugary at all.   It was my friend's birthday so she got us a free plate of fried ice cream and it was very delicious! I forgot to mention their free tortilla chips and salsa. The texture of the chips was so crispy and light it almost tasted like a potato chip. I never had anything quite like that before and I enjoyed it very much.

The pizza wasn't bogged down with toppings nor was it scant.  I'd say they have the equation right for a great pi!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I keep ""waiting"" to have a less-than-awesome meal at Matt the Miller's... but it just hasn't happened yet.  Everything we've tried has been great.  The interior is warm & comfortable, the beer selection rocks, and the food is worth the visit at lunch OR dinner.    The service in the bar area can be sketchy if you're there during a slow time (say, 3-ish) -- which is exactly when they should & can be Johnny-on-the-spot.  But during ""busy"" hours, the staff is on it -- friendly, responsive.    Such a nice change from the franchises in the area!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
Good food and a good hometown type atmosphere. A mix or bar and restaurant with nice servers. I will repeat. I had the fish taco and sliders. Both were good. Only reason it wasn't 5 stars is the glass wasn't chilled. I would give 4.5 stars if AV.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Yes, the rest of the meal was marvelous, -generous servings, well plated, beautifully cooked, excellent service- but wowie, you must try the mango milkshake. The fajita fillings came out sizzling, and the corn tortilla was the warm from the grill, authentic, fluffy-soft, handmade El Salvadoran pupusa type.  I thought the t.v. was too loud, but, so what.

"I'm usually reluctant to try non-chain Italian restaurants because you never know what you're going to get with the tomato-based sauce. Years ago, I tried a different restaurant in the French Quarter and hated the meal so much I couldn't even finish it. I hate sweet spaghetti sauce. Well, we got a flyer for Stella's in the mail and my family wanted to try it. So we did today.  The restaurant is small, but very clean. Seating is comfortable. I appreciate both of those in a restaurant.  Since I was unsure of whether they had a sweet sauce, I went ahead and ordered a small pizza. Thin crust which I really like. Ate half and took the other half home. One family member ordered a meatball sandwich and so I decided to taste a bit of the meat and was happy to find a savory sauce used. I was also impressed with the way the meatballs were smashed down between the bread. To me, that makes a better sandwich because every bite is full of meatball and a whole ball isn't going to fall out onto your plate.  Definitely would return. Or even try delivery as they have a HUGE delivery area.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

We both had ""happy plates"" , very clean!  Check out web sight because the only do dinner three nights.  Oh, and I had a bloody mary and it was really good, the salt on rim was spicy. Yum!

"My first time here, and it was a great experience.. I had a long day and stopped in for lunch before I headed home.. This is a pretty large and open interior with plenty of space between tables... I didn't have a lot of time on my hands and chose to sit at the bar. The bartender was friendly, funny, helpful, and informative. He gave me a quick rundown on the craft beers on tap, I sampled a few before deciding which I liked.... For lunch, something caught my eye while we were talking. It was in a small cast iron pan and smelled great as it went by... I asked the bartender what it was and ordered it. That great smelling pan contained tater tots with diced and fried pork belly, cheese, ranch, and scallions.... This dish was mind blowing good to be something so simple. Not only a great lunch. But it's also simple enough that I could make this at home!! This place isn't anywhere close to my home.

Wife had the red beans and rice special, which they only have on Monday's.  It was under 8 bucks.  Lots of businessmen eat lunch in here, that's how good it is, though they look really outta place as this joint hasn't been redecorated probably ever and it's like 50 years old.

The food is very delicious and fresh, I really enjoyed the fact that there are kind of western favorites like the pork skewers and like the curry, but it also seems like they keep some authenticity on the menu too. I really enjoyed seeing the food items listed in the English interpretation of the actual food names. Worth a stop for lunch or dinner, but pay attention to the time you can get lost in conversation.

"Traditional Americanized Thai food. Owned and operated by Thai people, that used to own the Thai market also. I was able to get some authentic Thai food, once they knew I lived in Thailand 10 years and knew what to ask for. You would figure that since they owned the Thai market, they would have access to all of the correct Thai vegetables and spices for the restaurant, but they don't really use them.

"Pizzeria Pesto is not to be confused with Pesto just a few doors down. They're both owned by the same people, both BYO, and both offer uber delicious Italian food. The pizzeria is obviously more casual, easier to get a table, has delivery and pick up options via Eat 24 on Yelp, and is perhaps a better option when you have the littles in tow.   It's on the smaller side but they do have a balcony for more crowded nights. You start your meal with complimentary garlic knots for each member of your party and pesto potato salad. Their house Pesto is phenomenal! Do not miss a taste! It's not what you're thinking when you hear potato salad. It's just potatoes and Pesto and it's rather yummy!  They have a vast selection of delicious pizzas! Get one to split even if this won't be you're main meal! A small was perfect for two adults. They offer a variety of classic pasta dishes too. They do not have a kid's menu and they do charge for sharing which is usually something I highly dislike. The saving grace here is that they offer any of their pastas in a kid's portion for about $6 so that was a great option for the wee ones. One ordered simple marinara and the other alfredo. They both chose penne although there were many pasta options including gluten free.   Get a cannoli for dessert! You will not be sorry. It's thinner than many others in the South Philly but equally as tasty, even more so than some places.   The service was what I have grown to expect from any South Philly establishment. Thick accents and treated like family. Lots of ""Huns"" and ""dolls"" being thrown around. The ladies were great as was some friendly gentleman on the way out asking us to return.

"Bread is something that's quite important to me and what's made me rather sad about a lot of the Vietnamese sandwich places around here is that they don't have enough turnover to have, well, fresh bread.  To be honest, I view Hooked more as a place that sells yummy stuff with their yummy bread, rather than a Vietnamese / American seafood fusion spot.    Don't get me wrong, after having the sampler appetizer platter, I was pretty happy with the calamari and coconut shrimp with the assortment of Asian sauces to be had.  I wasn't a big fan of the fried fish, but hey, 2 out of three wasn't too bad.  In the end, I'll likely just come here for the Bánh Mi.  It was amply stuffed with pickled veges and meat and the bread... oh man the bread... crusty chewy pillowy soft... all at the same freaking time.  I definitely won't be bothering with other places for it.  They have some ""po boys,"" entrees, and soup, ALL to ensure that they'll need fresh bread on a regular basis!    Smart move.  Yeah, I know it's kind of silly that my favorite thing at a fusion spot is the pure ethnic stuff, but what can I say.  Salt'n pepper squid with lime?  Sure!  I'll have that in sandwich form too.  *edit:  I have since come back and I'll likely stick to the sandwiches.  Had the ""beef stew bahn mi"" the other day and it was literally just beef stew with a loaf for dipping, which was pretty delicious, btw.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I had never heard of this restaurant before I saw it on Groupon. It was a tasty quaint little spot right in downtown Haddon Heights. The decor is pretty yet understated and the restaurant itself is not very large. I see this being good for a romantic date or a small dinner with 3 or 4 friends. Don't forget to BYOB!  The food was good. I was not a huge fan of my mussels but everything else was great and the food was very fresh. The $26.00 prix fix menu was definitely worth it. And when the waitress tells you that each plate is a few bites (tapas) she is lying... there was definitely enough food on each plate to be a meal for me. I shared anyway. :)    The niceest touch was that the chef himself brought out the main course.

Ok I took a chance on this place based on their menu in a tourist magazine. I was not disappointed in the food at all. I started off with the char- grilled oysters and I have to say it was delicious. Being from the North they were Delish!The seafood gumbo was on point as well. Our waiter who was excellent said this gumbo is the closest thing next to homemade. Well the invite did not come so I have to say this was the best I tasted down here. The crab cake was so so as it had a lot of fillers. I would not order this again.

The only issue is that the place can get crowded pretty quickly, so it's hard to have a leisurely time there when you feel like you're being rushed out - though the wait staff is polite enough to make it less annoying.

I haven't tried shrimp and grits before but these were really good. I will totally come back and eat here again. Here's a tip: they have two entrances to the restaurant.

And pretzel breadsticks. For those alone they deserve 5 stars.   Went this past weekend with a friend for dinner. Happy Hour specials rock here, so we had a few glasses of wine and martinis. We opted not to start with an appetizer, but I did add on a Blue Cheese Wedge salad to my meal. Nice size and large chunks of bacon.  My friend had the Steak Salad as her entree. Large, the steak was cooked to temp, and the raspberry dressing wasn't overly sweet. I had the Sirloin steak with creamed spinach. Cooked the way I liked it, and a good cut of meat, but needed a tad of salt. Definitely not where I'd go if I wanted a great steak, and I wish I would've had the oak grilled salmon, which I've had before and loved.

Entree was the redfish oceana - cooked perfectly and topped with a cream sauce w/crawfish tails.  What a great pairing.  The only downside was that I was not that fond of the vegetable side dish.  One big detractor - mice on the patio.  Maybe it would be better not to seat people close enough to the giant mousetraps that they can watch the wildlife during dinner.

"Baja fresh prides itself on fresh ingredients, and made to order food. no cans and no microwaves are part of their motto. I can't say that they always live up to this, but I certainly feel there is a lot to credit this chain for.   The selection is definitely the largest of any burrito-ey chain; there is something for pretty much anyone. They also have constantly rotating specials to keep things interesting, most recently their summer tacos were pretty good. you'll also hardly ever have to pay full price as you can find coupons anywhere from your last receipt to emails sent often to your inbox.   The salsa bar is sadly what most keeps me coming back. Several salsas, fresh cilantro and limes are all unlimited. I also like their new focus on biodegradable packaging, to go along with their longstanding option to buy a cup and bring it back with you for cheap refills.  Customer service has always been good to me here as well. Friendly counter workers, and even the guys mopping the floors say hello with a smile. My only issue is that I can never seem to get more than just warm food, and it's always cold by the time I get it home. also sometimes the pico de gallo looks made with unappealing tomatoes and should have not been put out for use.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Toucan Charlie's is among a few places around town to offer a champagne brunch on both Saturday and Sunday -- and it's open untill 3 in the afternoon!   Many treasures can be found at the brunch, and the finest of all are right in the center. Oysters on the half shell, crab claws, charcuterie and delicious blue cheese are my favorites.  Of course, prime rib, bread pudding and all the other usual suspects are there for the taking. But Toucan Charlie's is best enjoyed by trying something new and unexpected.  Oh, before I forget, here's some well practiced advice: If you give your server a nice tip at the start of your meal, you'll soon be drowning in J.

"Wow, others weren't kidding when they said the serving size is so generous. My Lomo Saltado was def. enough to feed two people along with comparable prices to other Pervuian restaurants, which leaves my stomach grinning.   Right now, I am not dining indoors due to Covid-19, so I get most of my food To Go as a result. The chef had no mask and the waiter/waitress had their masks on their chins not covering their nose or mouth; Some reviewers gave 1 star because they find it to be one of the issues from their experience coupled with other problems.  I want to share the positives, which includes:  A.) A nice color on the steak from the high temps of the wok.  B.) I would be remiss if I didn't mention how tasty the steak was from the soy marinade. You need the green aji amarillo sauce for a kick of heat - you better have your ice water ready!  C.) You get enough rice to feed a village, but the fries I asked for on the side was pitiful because they were soggy w/no flavor and I didn't eat them.

"*WOULD RECOMMEND*  Stumbled upon this place on my way to get ice cream in Fishtown and thought I'd give this place a try. The restaurant is quite small with two large party tables and two counter tables. The menu is not too big and has all you ever need in a ramen shop, some appetizers, some rice bowls, and of course, the classic ramen and speciality ramen bowls. Price was standard of ramen in Philly ($10-$15). You can add additional toppings to ramen and adjust spice level. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the ramen noodles were and the noodles were different depending on dish. My Hajimaru Signature came was thin ramen noodles with the perfect al dente texture. The shoyu ramen came with a thicker noodle. Overall soup was decent, could be richer. Chashu was very flavorful, salty, and lean, if only it had a bit more fat.  Hajimaru Signature ramen - their speciality ramen with all the toppings you could ask for in a ramen in a spicy tonkotsu broth. This broth wasn't as good as the shoyu broth. I asked for less spicy and it wasn't bad at all. Love love their noodles, has a very nice chew to it.   Shoyu ramen - thicker noodles than hajimaru ramen. This broth has a stronger tonkotsu taste and was better than Hajimaru one in my opinion.   *VERDICT* I wouldn't mind coming back again",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Vincent's has been a favorite for many years.  Shame to say, we hadn't eaten there in over a year.  Grand-daughter @ Tulane, car problem; solution = Vincent's.  This is always a very good eatery, solid N.O. ""Italian Creole"", nice bar, pro waitstaff.  Always crowded; good people watching, too.Vincent's has been a favorite since we ""accidently"" found it 20 years ago, under previous owners.   Revisited two weeks ago, Wife, I, & Tulane student granddaughter from Folrida. Vincent's is crowded, packed, full of local savants.  For good reason.  We had drinks, canneloni, salads, wonderful crab, shrimp, etc casserole, more drinks;  all very satisfied; tab around $100 + tip.   Very reasonable considering the excellent quality of Vincent's Gulf Coast-meets-Little Italy creations.  Spent a couple pleasant hours, one at bar, one at table.  Canneloni excellent as usual, shrimp & lump crabmeat wonderful.  Doggie bags.  Then, got bill; only $88 for three great meals ( plus $12.00 for drinks); can't beat that.

She even offered to bring us different salad dressings, which was nice of her.    The burger was nice and juicy. Although a little messy with the egg, it was delicious! I usually enjoy the Banzai Burger which is a bit more fun with the pineapple and teriyaki glaze, but the Royal Red Robin was really good if you like egg in your burger.  The salad was fresh and had a good amount of ripe avocado chunks in it.  I don't usually get salads at restaurants, but I think I would order this again.

Overall a great place. Today though they lost my business.  Why?  Because with my order I wanted a cup of ice water to go.  The only water cups they have don't have lids and the cashier said that I need to buy a soda to get a cup with a lid. I don't mind paying 25 cents or whatever the cost is to cover a cup with a lid for my ice water so I can take it with me on a hot day yet the cashier said this was not possible and that she doesn't make the rules.  As a result I canceled my entire order and left. The food here is very good.  Perhaps someday they will let customers have ice water to go with a lid when purchasing other items.

"My husband and I are definitely a fan of Parc. We ate here tonight, with a reservation, and were seated immediately.   We received water, and the bread basket soon after being seated (which was delicious). We ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, which was amazing. The shrimp were big, and very fresh. The cocktail sauce had just the right amount of horseradish in it. As for our entrée, I ordered the 1/2 roasted chicken, and my husband ordered the veal. Okay, so, my roasted chicken was awful. I'm sorry, Parc, maybe it was just an off night? The chicken tasted like a rotisserie chicken from the market that was cut in half and thrown on my plate. It just wasn't good. The mashed potatoes, however, were very creamy and the best I've had. My husband's veal was tender, and the mushrooms were an excellent pairing to the veal. I really enjoyed his dish; I would definitely order it for myself next time.  We're definitely coming back this weekend to try their brunch. Great atmosphere, and our server was very nice.

For the main course.. yes.. more food we had the Roasted Duck Breast, which was served with fig reduction sauce, it was great.

"Welcome to an original Japanese experience. I never take my reviews lightly so I have hesitated to write on a newly renovated establishment like Sushi Zona. That being said, let me tell you that I have enjoyed my experience here. Many already know that this used to be owned by another person but the new owners have done their best to not only do good by the former customers but also to make this location their new home.  Just look at their name and you know they are looking for a place in the local community.  let me start with this.... Only a few items, in my opinion, need some improvement. Namely, I would prefer a better quality pork katsu and korokke. That being said, the food is quite good. Prices are on par with other places but there are less expensive places to be sure. However, this is really up to each customer to decide.  Sushi is quality and kitchen is well done. Being well versed in Japanese I can tell you that the people who work there are Japanese... and it shows in the quality service. One notable point is that on Mondays you may be treated to a ladies-only sushi chef experience. Honestly, this is rare at any sushi establishment so I guess you could call Mondays 'ladies night'. The owner is quite involved with the establishment so you will find your experience to be up to Japanese standards (IMHO). The one missing star is only for personal budget (less expensive would be better) LOL.

The scorched earth is well worth the money because it's covered in a mixture of whitefish, tuna, and scallops, salmon in spicy mayo and torched on top to add a Smokey flavor.

"After my first time at Serpico, I left impressed but not wowed by what I ate.  Sure, certain portions of my meal were wonderful but I hadn't experienced the bliss that I was expecting to get when I went into the meal.  This was unfair of me and on a subsequent visit I was thoroughly impressed and have officially become a fan of this place.  What impressed me the most about Serpico was that even though the house was packed, with all seats full, both in chairs and at the counter (where I sat), the kitchen didn't seem to miss a beat.  They just kept on in perfect fashion and food just kept rolling out.  Big props to the staff on that.  The hand torn pasta that we shared was peculiar because on first bite I wasn't expecting the taste of snail.  As I continued eating it though, it grew on me and by the end of the dish, I really enjoyed it.  The pig tail, a special that evening was marvelous.  It was falling of the bone and sitting on a bed of polenta that had hot sauce all over it.  I think the kitchen was having fun and I appreciated eating what they turned out.  The lamb ribs for two also did not disappoint in the least.  It was a hefty portion and the texture on this dash was also fantastic.  The yogurt was an excellent opposite flavor to the spicy vegetables that were also alongside the meat.  The sauce for the ribs themselves tasted very complex and was sweet, salty, a bit sour and just left me puzzled as to how they made it.  It looks like Serpico is here to play and I like it.  I was unsure how they would fit on south street but it seems like people are filling the seats and the kitchen is putting out the good stuff.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I would go back for another shot at it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I've only been here once but really enjoyed the sandwich that I ordered.  I had the Rubicon Special which had gouda, turkey, a diced tomato spread, lettuce, and probably a couple other veggies that I forgot about.  I went there right before closing so the only bread they had available was white and pesto, and the pesto bread was excellent.  Definitely some of the better local deli bread that I've had.  The inside of the deli is fairly small but the outside seats plenty of people.  The sandwich was prepared fairly quickly although I was the only person in the place (ten minutes before closing) and I can picture a fifteen or twenty minute wait around a busy lunch hour.  The sandwiches are a bit pricey at $8 for a whole, but you really need to take into account the great tasting bread, fresh quality ingredients, and the size of the sandwich.  Definitely one of the larger sandwiches that the local Reno delis serve up.  I'll definitely be going back here often, although I think Newman's is still my favorite Reno deli because of the selection and prices alone.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Just stopped here for lunch as we were passing through Santa Barbara.  I fully enjoyed my meal.  I ordered the steak sandwich and my husband ordered the fish sandwich.  Both were incredibly delicious,m.  The baguette that the steak sandwich was on, was fresh and perfectly toasted... I struggled with wanting to finish the whole thing, but being too full. Plus I wanted to save a little room for the coconut cake.  We ordered the coconut cake for desert.  It was light and creamy and not overly sweet.  The layers of buttercream and a nice saltiness that complimented the sauce that went with it.  I definitely recommend ordering the cake if you happen to stop in here to eat.  When in Santa Barbara again, I will definitely stop by to try their dinner menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"It's been years since eating here.  It was a a pleasant experience.  Our server, Brent was very descriptive of the various martinis and food items.  With a bit more emphasis it would be Shakespearean.  The Dinner for Two special was a good value as it provided a shared appetizer.  Who doesn't like the bang bang shrimp?  The sea scallops were grilled perfectly, with just the right amount of carmelization on them.  It tasted great with the bed of risotto.  I had the Rockefeller Cobia.  It had a few bones in it; but were picked out.  The manager came by afterwards and apologized for the bones.  That was a nice touch.  The ""rockefeller topping"" was a bit light as I was expecting more like an oysters rockefeller.  The crab lumps were also a bit small.  Overall a good dish; but expectations weren't there.  The coconut pie was all coconut.  So if you are coo coo for coconuts, this is a nice dessert.  Overall, good food and great dining experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I've always gotten solid pizza and friendly service here. One time I came in maybe 15 minutes before closing and they still made a fresh pie for me on the spot (I know, I know, I was THAT person). I've only done carry-out, but they have a lot of seating available if you do wish to dine in. The dough can be a tad bit sweet, so if you don't like that then don't bother. Overall I think this place makes pretty good pizza for a pretty good price. I usually get the plain cheese but ""the works"" is tasty as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Ate at the new Five Guys on Walnut between 11th and 12th a couple days ago. In terms of flavor and hunger satisfaction, there isn't a better burger place nearby. Now, I haven't been to Bobby's Burger Palace yet, so for some I know that may not be true. But this place is close by and absolutely delicious.  They keep things simple over there. Burgers already come with two patties, so if you want less, you ask for a little burger. You get to customize what you want on it, and there are lots of things to choose from. Fries are extra, there aren't any meal deals here, so while the $5-6 burger is tempting, know that adding fries and a drink DOES bring your total to more like $10. It's worth it, though. The fries are made fresh, and actually taste it, with peanut oil, which is tasty and healthier than some alternatives.   I'll also say this, the staff there is super nice and helpful. I got to strike up conversations with them multiple times. It's a big place, there's lots of places to sit, and it's bright and clean.  I also love that they don't advertise, and subsist solely off of word of mouth. They line their walls with their commendations from around the country. You end up feeling like you have to agree with them by the end of it. It's a pretty great burger.  This is the closest burger joint to get to my favourite from the West Coast, In-N-Out Burger, and that to me is the highest praise I can give it. When you want to fill up with something good and greasy, get to Five Guys.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Reading Terminal is a food fiesta, and I am RSVPing yes to this party again. It can be hard to decide WHAT to eat when there is so much yum in such small square footage.   I needed a quick sandwich during a conference, and Hershel's East Side Deli fit my pescatarian's needs perfectly.    I ordered the tuna sandwich, and it was truly delicious. I don't like much (or any really) mayo, and their mix was perfect. The pickle on the side was also homemade and so tasty.   My only critique was maybe that my sandwich was SO big I could barely eat it all. I thought my native Texas was the queen of big sandwiches, but Hershel's gave me the biggest tuna sandwich I have ever seen.  The staff here are all cool people, busy, and keep the line moving along efficiently.   Unfortunately, they were out of their latkes, which I desperately wanted to try. Next time, Hershel's!

But she made a valid point, you would pay $12 for two orders of hand rolls; not to mention the fusion and special rolls included in the buffet.   We set a day to go and after looking at pictures on here, the anticipation built! I love sushi, and this place did not let me down. I tried new rolls I've never had before, as well as nigiri sushi and salmon roe.  My only dissappointment (and it was of no fault to Minado) but after a 40 minute round trip commute from work taken away from our 1 hour lunch, that left us with 20 minutes in what I called ""sushi heaven"".

"Actually, the sashimi set is not listed on the menu, but you can order this dish and the chefs will randomly customize it for you. However, it takes luck to order this dish. Depend on the daily ingredients, the type of sashimi will change. I like more variety instead of repeated combinations. P.S.  The owners are two chefs.

"Came here for a belated Valentine's day dinner.  Décor was comfortable yet fancy and elegant.  We showed up 15 minutes earlier and was told our table will not be ready till our reservation time.  We stood near the hostess and within a matter of 5 minutes, a waiter me and asked if we wanted drinks while we were waiting.  The staff is highly attentive.  The waitress thoroughly explained the menu.  We started with the Seafood Mixto and Roasted Cauliflower.  Seafood MIxto was a tad bit salty but still enjoyable.  I am definitely a fan of the Roasted  Cauliflower cooked with Raisins.  We order the Black Squid ink pasta.  This dish was Super Salty and we had to send it back.  Waitress was extremely understanding and ordered us another noting less salt.  The GM came by to apologize.  The 2nd Squid ink pasta came out and it was still unbearably salt.  At that point, we just wanted to continue with our meal, so ate it and told the waitress it was a tad better but still on the saltier side.  Entrees we ordered the Cod and hanger steak (Huge portion, the potatoes were amazingly tasty).  We ended with Pear Crostada (most delicious thing I've ever eaten).  I would come back just for the dessert and the impeccable service given.  They were understanding, accommodating and attentive.  They took the Pasta off our bill and gave us a scoop of ice cream on the house.    Keep up the good work WM Mulherin.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"At last we've made it into this curiously named spot. The service was nearly spot on and the food was delicious.   I'm not sure if they gave us the right salad, we ordered the Som Tum Mango (Thai Style Spicy Mango Salad). It wasn't medium spice as ordered, but perhaps we should have ordered hot spicy. Regardless, it was very good and was a nice balance to our curries.  The red curry and massaman were very similar, I loved the high bamboo to chicken ratio in the red, and peanuty cream in the massaman. The stir-fried eggplant was good, but the sauce overpowered these delicate little veggies. Not sure that I'd order that dish again, and it wouldn't win over any newcomers to eggplant. The coconut rice was yummy and the perfect base for the curries.  Our group paired the meal with Singha and Chang Thai beer and the meal came in at a very reasonable price with a couple bevies each.  Our server was very welcoming and friendly, it felt like being welcomed into the family with gentle recommendations and timely service. We'll be back.   UPDATE: We took our leftovers home and they were delicious. The only caveat is they didn't send home the left over mango salad or one of the curries.  I know there was leftover sauce with a few bamboo shoots that weren't in our doggie bag, and darn it, I loved the sauce and those crispy tidbits. I'd take away a star if I didn't enjoy the food that much!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
There is so much here!! I came here because it was new and my mother wanted some place nice to eat. Not Wendy's haha. So we sat down and engaged in a great conversation with the couple next to us. I ended up ordering exactly what they had as the guy had been there before and said that the lamb is delicious here. I love lamb so I was intrigued. He said it wasn't gamey and it was delicious. (He knew a lot of other facts about lamb as well) so I ordered their lamb sticks and a pasta dish. The lamb was so fresh and delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly. PERFECTLY. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that the service was a little weird. Our waiter wasn't the best and when we asked other staff about other parts of the restaurant because it has so much more to offer there was a slight language block. Which made it a little awkward. But the dinning experience was generally really great. I'll be back for sure.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
First time at Woodfire MJ.  Celebrating our anniversary.  All around we were satisfied & will go back.  Steak (beef tenderloin) & pork chop were delicious.  Vegetable sides could have been bigger but we had an appetizer so we were satisfied.  Key lime pie was amazing!!  It did seem casual & very loud for a tab of $100.  (We did have a $36 bottle of wine.).  Restaurant has tin ceilings & no art work on the walls which might help with the acoustics.

Their sid3s, I have no complaints with, but I have had better. They also sometimes have some problems with consistency.  I am not a cornbread fan, bun love their cornbread.

In fact, we ended up at the bar, which we normally do not like for dinner (apps, yes - dinner, no).  Our bartender was great and, as usual, their beer selection is excellent (especially Belgian offerings). Driving, however, cut me back to 1 beer. The house Cab was deemed acceptable by Carol.

"Found this little jewel in the vast jewelry store that is New Orleans dining. We were looking for a great place to grab brunch and Li'l Dizzy's Cafe popped up. When you walk in you see all of the history framed on the walls. Pictures of famous sporting figures, political figures, famous Hollywood filmstars, etc. When you walk in you know where you are. Good ole New Orleans, No fancy frills, just fun! The food was unbelievable. The brunch buffet looked amazing. Everything from grits, fried chicken, fried seafood, and an omelette station. While the brunch buffet looked absolutely amazing I was not looking for a huge breakfast. So instead i ordered the Shrimp and Grits (Shrimp Grillade) and I will tell you that it was unbelievably tasty. The Grits were perfectly cooked and flavorful. They give you plenty of shrimp and the grits have a delicious layer of gravy poured right over top the shrimp and grits. Then add the sauteed bell peppers, onions , and mushroom you have something truly special. And then you must add a biscuit because they are absolutely heavenly. Soft, buttery, and served right out the oven.   Li'l Dizzy's Cafe is something truly special. This is a must visit New Orleans staple that will make you feel right at home.

"I had the best duck I've ever had (outside of Paris) and certainly the best roasted duckling ever. The chef used a ""cherry-Kümmel"" sauce. Kümmel is caraway liqueur also flavored with cumin and fennel. While I also use cherries with duck, I never would have thought of Kümmel, but the herby flavor blended well with the sweet cherry and was not the boring fruity-sweet-only you usually find on duck. My duck half was tender and well-roasted, and I had to stop myself from chewing up the bones (not very elegant table manners at a big group dinner. But I was tempted.) The other diners had crab cakes (big, fluffy and full of lump crab meat), flank steak in bordelaise sauce (and each was cooked to order--so one person had it mooing and the other had it medium). The salmon was also cooked to order and looked tempting. But if that duck is on the menu, get it. You won't be sorry.  The two other reasons to come here: first, the beer selection is possibly the best in Delaware. Delaware is a beer-loving state. We make beer, we export beer (the famous Dogfish ales) and we certainly drink beer. I had a Bavik Pils, which is made in Belgium. Jessop's loves their Belgians, and I've also drunk Rodenbach fruit brewed beers here (one with cherry and one with cranberry and raspberry, so if you like sour dry beers, you can get them here--they are hard to find.) Since I was having duck, I wanted a light, bitter beer to offset the fruit sauce and rich fats of the duck and the Bavik was a light pilsner, more like German than heavier Bohemian and with a fruity overtone and very light hops bitterness that went well with the food--in fact, this draft beer was as good as any wine with food. If you don't like overly bitter pilsner, this is for you.   The second reason is the history and location. This is your date night location. Old New Castle dates back to the colonies before the US was the US and there are quaint streets and pretty old brick houses, shops lit up with appealing windows, and it's perfect for a stroll winter or summer in Delaware's usually mild and pleasant climate. Jessop's is a historic tavern and looks like Colonial times--uneven floors, oddly matched chairs, a long and dark room that harks back to Caesar Rodney, William Penn and George Washington. The waitstaff dress in colonial garb, and sometimes you hear fife and drum music. We had good classic Christmas tunes this time-perfect. Very very romantic and also the super-fun place for friends to gather and have conversation over a drink or two.   If you stick to what they do well on the menu, you'll have a great time. Some of the food is heavy and stick-to-your-ribs (the meatloaf is well-loved) and I've had a few things I didn't like at all, but when you know what to order (the soups, the sweet potato fries and any of the bar appetizers are also great) you can have a wonderful time. I think I've been here more than any other place in Delaware. And I'm going back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Parc has always given me more of an intimate vibe, including situations in which you are meeting your SO's parents or something, haha.  Waiters are knowledgeable about the wine pairings, and more than happy to make sure you have a good experience (if you can flag them down)!

"Went here on a suggestion from my friend.   Major pluses for LOTS OF FRESH. They have topping options that you just can't find around here. Like garlic. Minced garlic, roasted garlic, or garlic sauce-stuff (don't remember what it was exactly). Spinach. Roma tomatoes or sun-dried. Whatever. Thank you, Reginelli's, because I need some fresh on my pizza.  They also can do half and halfs. We shared the Mediterranean, I think, with spinach and a whole bunch of other stuff, including roasted garlic. No olives, add pineapple on my side. My pizza ""trinity"" is spinach, pineapple and garlic, so yay. And we got a side of hummus because my roomie's a hummus aficionado.   Mehs:  The hummus was suspect because it had a subtle tang like anchovies or something. Since I'm allergic to types of fish, I have to be careful, but I didn't ask and I still ate it. I didn't end up having a reaction, I don't think, so if there was some kind of paste in there, it was slight. Ask.  Also, the service was only ok. It was ok, but only ok. They seemed overstaffed for the 1-3 parties that were there at a given time, kinda standing around. Drink got filled, but it was just weird. I was confused when I walked in why we were the only customers and the restaurants down the block had filled their sidewalk seating.   They have some beer, the usuals, and wine. But I looked at the wine selection and I was NOT impressed. I wasn't there to drink, but now that I'm informed I would never go there to drink.   Besides, the atmosphere just not right for drinking. It seems like more of a lunch place. The atmosphere seemed a little forced.   All in all, I'm gonna go to a restaurant for the food, and the food was great.

We started with a Thai iced tea, which was good. I love those. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was good and vanished quickly. We all ordered lunch specials and we got an order of cheese wontons.   The egg drop soup was only ok, I thought. Husband loved it. Kids ate just a little of theirs. Our meals showed up next and we inquired about our cheese wontons and were informed the chef forgot them, they'd be right out.   They were out shortly after that and they were delicious. Nice and light, not greasy at all.   The entrees were good too. The kids had sesame chicken, husband had generals chicken, and I had kung pao beef. I liked mine best, but I liked all of theirs also. The beef was so tender and flavorful, without being overly spicy. I enjoyed that the crispy chicken didn't have a thick breading. It has a very very thin layer so you get the full flavor of the chicken instead of a mouthful of oily fried batter. The kids said they found the sesame chicken to be a little too dry- they doused it in sweet and sour sauce. Kids.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I'm already won the fuck over  We came straight from the airport -- so super late, super hungry, and super cold because it was -40 degrees out. Things I recommend and remember: -Pressed sushi: We got the wild salmon and the negi-toro. It was weird because ive never had pressed sushi. The salmon had a slight sear because the torched the mayo-cream sauce on top. Both were pretty good, expected more fish though.  -Asari clams: bruhhhh not only the clams delicious, but the sake/garlic butter broth it was soaked in was to die for. We almost drank it like soup. It had a nice clean but delicious taste -- HONESTLY because it was freakin half butter, and who doesnt like butter  -Mt Fuji Alberta AAA steak: Steak comes on top of a rock plate made from Mt Fuji (idk if its real but whatever). We got it medium rare, perfect pink middle, melt in mouth goodness  we ordered some other stuff, but those were my favorites! Pass on the corn-kale thing though. lmao too healthy-tastinggg Beware though, we did come hungry, so for a tapas-style meal, it did get a bit pricey.

We were recently staying at a resort on St. Pete's Beach and went to Nori Thai after our daughter recommended it...and it was close! We don't know quite what to make of the Thai/Sushi combination, but just ended up ordering Thai.  We ordered everything ""hot,"" which was spicy but manageable.  We didn't need to add any spice, but could have stood it a little hotter. The basil spring rolls were tasty, and the peanut sauce is rumored to be made from scratch.  The ""Thai-tanic"" soup was nice...a bowl for one instead of family style like we usually see. For main courses we had a ""fishermans platter"" served in a clay pot, which was tasty, and red-curry with coconut and chicken just like we get at home.  The food was great and we took home the left overs. Honestly, the best part was the service.  Maybe it's the language barrier at some of the places we go, but we both noticed that the wait staff at Nori Thai was the friendliest we've seen in a long time.

"There are surprisingly quite a few greek food joints around Tucson, may it be a chain such as My Big Fat Greek to smaller restaurants such as Falafel King and Athen's on Fourth. What I really like about Opa! is that their quality and quantity is at a great medium in comparison to My Big Fat Greek, which is expensive, and not incredible and Falafel King which, is cheap but mediocre at best. I like that there is a free pita, hummus, and tzaziki plate as an appetizer. And their five dollar lunch specials are like the bomb on your mom.  That is all.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Overall excellent for a value Chinese place.   As the four-star rating says, ""Yay!  I'm a fan!"".   Got the General Tso's chicken and a hot & sour.   Total was just shy of $9 for lunch.      The chicken was spicy like I ordered it, and not battered to death.  The texture of the meat was really excellent and the sauce was very tasty.   The hot/sour was what you'd expect, nothing special.    This is now my go-to default Chinese place, even if it means a short drive.  It's good enough to justify passing by other places to get there.   Oh, and seeing the comments from the other folks about the owners...  I just got take-out, but an older Asian man waved at me as I was carrying out - big friendly smile.    The OE has earned my business, and I will most definitely be back soon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Stuffed cabbage, bigos , pirogies , fried pork cutlets , and of course Kielbasa! All served with two sides. All under $10. Get the potatoes pancakes . If you had a Polish grandmother she would make you food just like this.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
This was my first time having hot chicken and it was damn good!  I got the tenders with medium hotness level and it was the perfect amount of heat. The tenders were juicy and the outside was crispy. The baked beans I had were great and had nice chunks of meat but the fries were soggy.  The place is in a strip mall and was a little dirty but what do you expect from a chicken joint.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I was craving Filipino comfort food, and pancit was on my mind!  Quick little Yelp search, and boom!  I was on my way to Lolo's! I called in my order and set my course.  She said it would take 10 minutes...what? Super-speedy!  I had longer drive time than that, but that was fast!  Pro tip - Google seems to think they're closed at random times, so call ahead to be sure! Arrived to an empty parking lot, yikes, had they closed? Nope!  Dining room was empty too, aside from a slightly sketchy looking guy hanging around.  Someone inside was keeping an eye on him, so I didn't let it bother me. Sooo...lovely, pungent, palabok!!! Savory, fishy, porky, saucy goodness...this is good stuff! This makes that jolly-whatever stuff look like goo in a takeout box. A hearty portion of rice noodles, shrimp gravy, pork pieces, chicharon crumbs and hard boiled egg, topped with green onion and fried garlic, then add a squeeze of citrus and a splash of fish sauce, mix to combine and devour.

"I was in the neighborhood for an appointment, walking back to my car with a grumbly stomach and stumbled upon The Quick Fixx. Decided to go for the $10 lunch special getting the gnocchi in garlic sauce + arugula salad. The gnocchi was quite good, but not as tender and squishy as I love. But it was fried on each side which gave it a different texture. The salad was just OK but they sure gave you a whole lot. Fresh arugula + parmasean + lemon vinaigrette.

"I walk past Salt on a daily baises, and haven't tried it until a late Friday evening with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday. Not going to lie ... I had my reservations and preconceived notions about this resto. However, Salt did manage to exceed my expectation.  For drinks I ordered the Nik Nak to begin with and a pinot noir to go with my meal, and I enjoyed both. The table did order the skillet bread with honey butter. The honey butter was solid and I liked the black salt (I think?) added to it for texture and flavor. For my entree I ordered the chef's special, which included a slightly blacken fish (I forget what kind, but it was slightly meatier) with the tomato lime sauce and lobster risotto. Every aspect of the dish complimented each other and it took everything in me not to grab some leftover bread and lap up my leftover sauce.  I would definitely recommend requesting Jey as your server ! He definitely knew the menu well to give recommendations and knew which wines to go with your entrée (I would haven't thought of a pinot noir for fish) ! He made sure our table was happy and to made our table's birthday girl feel special.  I would come back to Salt for special occasions or if in the mood for some well-prepared seafood.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"My husband and I live in the Bay Area and trek up to Reno a few times a year for some fun and debauchery, and we always have dinner at The Steakhouse at Harrah's.  We LOVE our steaks, and the meals at The Steakhouse are always top notch - even in comparison to some very high-end places in San Francisco and Las Vegas.  The table-side cesar salads are phenomenal, and it's very entertaining to see you salad being made in front of you.  The creamy french onion soup is to die for, as is my favorite - filet mignon.  The only reason I am not giving The Steakhouse five stars is because we have noticed the service slipping over the past year. We just went there last night for dinner and had made our reservations weeks in advance, but our table wasn't ready until 20 minutes after our initial reservation time.  Instead of offering us a drink at the bar on the house while we waited, the maitre'd made us sit in the hall.  I was quite appalled.  Sometimes the bussers are really terrible as well, but the actual waiters are generally pretty good.  To The Steakhouse management:  please get your service up to your former standards, and for God's sake, when you are late for a reservation, offer your hungry patrons a free drink while they wait!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Ate here several times now.  I've only tried the cooked rolls and other various dishes, so I cannot judge the raw sushi.  If you order no onions in the fried rice, you will get no veggies at all.  Thus, they must have a sliced up mix that they use.  Thai fried rice was good, but the regular fried rice is a little bland.  Cooked special rolls are very tasty and they have a large selection, which is nice.  Good service.  Not as good for take out as the parking lot is full from the rest of the shops and movie theater in the mini mall.  Overall, good, not fabulous, but good.  I would give the special rolls 4.5 stars.

"One of the stronger contenders for pho in the STL area. Probably one of the better ones in my opinion.   The atmosphere: not a date place, go to the other pho places for that.   This is the pho place for when you want some good pho, a nice portion and light-flavorful broth. Unfortunately it was saltier than expected, I found  myself drinking a lot of water afterwards. But the broth here I think was great, compared to other places in STL. They provide a generous portion of food for the price, and a good amount of meat.

I'm still craving them right now as I write this review. We also had the orange chicken and the Dan Dan  noodles. I liked the orange chicken but I could still taste the uncooked flour in the dredge.

This was a good sized burger....at least two hands to hold....It came with melted goat cheese with an onion jam.. don't ask cause I don't know what onion jam is. I'll be honest it looked like chunky black tar. However it tasted of Heaven! I'm serious here I've never eaten something that looked like melted roof tiles but tasted that awesome!   I love goat cheese and was skeptical that this was going to be real but I was pleasantly surprised with the authenticity and taste of this cheese. It covered the whole burger and was piping hot.   The only detractor to this meal was I ordered my burger medium rare and what I got was a solid medium. But I can overlook this slight mishap because the flavor profile was over the top delicious.   I am a bar sitter. Mostly because service at a bar is much more personal and acceptable than having a distant server wait on you and 90 other people.  This was no exception.

"This is one of those times when I reallly want to give 3 and 1/2 stars! Darn it, yelp!  Ro-Zu is a sushi aficionado's wet dream. This is the freshet sushi-grade fish I have ever tasted in my life. And freshness doesn't come cheap, folks! Don't expect tempura-anything and a bunch of American-sounding rolls. The menu is small and the omakase is its star. This is *not* the place to get together with a group of friends or go for a quick bite. Think romantic dinner (don't forget BYOB) or a long business lunch.   Service was beyond slow, even though we were the ONLY people in the restaurant at the time. I was extremely put off by the boss/owner/head chef(?) guy. He was conducting business right in front of us, talking on the phone, and even schooling the the server for later that night. I've worked in the food industry--there's a reason you have your staff come before the place is open to guests. He came off as arrogant and elitist, and it's much too early in his restaurateur days for that.   Anyway, like I said, best fish I've ever had.

"Ok, just got back from Clearwater Beach, stayed at the Quality Inn on the beach.  This being my first time in Florida ever, I was there for 4 days (not including flying), and ate here 3 times!    So on a Friday Afternoon the BF and I were looking for some place to eat, on our walk to the Hilton to see how long it'd take us to get there the next day for a wedding we were going too.  After looking at the menu for Crabby's we decided to look at Frenchy's, I was not sold on Crabby's.  I'm so glad we chose Frenchy's.  We sat at the bar, where the bartender explained to us that they have fantastic Rum Runners, they were ""known"" for them.  After my trip, I'm pretty sure everyone is known for them on the beach, I hate rum, but I think I love Rum Runners now, at least at the beach!  The bartender gave us a run down of all the alcohol that goes into it and even stated that they had to change up their recipe for the frozen one because it wouldn't freeze in their machine.  That has vacation drink spelled all over it!  I had the daily special, Black & Blu Tuna Samich!  OMG, fantastic!  SOoooo much great flavor.  The BF had a Carribean Jerk Grouper samich and I had a bite it was tough to go from my samich to his, but his was still pretty good too!  3 Rum runners for me 4 for him, two good meals, end Experience 1 at Frenchy's.    Second time was around the same time of day, two days later.  Same cool chick bartender, who remembered us and asked how our vacation was coming a long.  We got nothing but fried food as this was the day after the fabulous wedding, so we were too hung over to stomach anything else.  Let's see I've never had conch fritters, and my BF insisted we had to have them.  I loved them I thought they were great, BF didn't think they were all that good, said they were too doughy.  We had the chicken quesadilla, and it was gross, but determined later that the chicken is just not good in Florida, judging from similar experiences at other places in Clearwater.  End experience 2 at Frenchy's off to the hotel to get a good 2 hour nap in.    After my nap we headed to Crabby's to finally try that out...one full beer left on the table, split basket of gator bites and I found myself back at Frenchy's!  Ok, so this was my final experience, and our cool chick bartender was off, but we still found her at the end of the bar, along with the manager lady (at least that's what I'm assuming she was) having a good time.  They saw that we came back, laughed and told us they lived there too! The guy bartender has a lot to learn from the chick bartender, cause he could careless that anyone was sitting at the bar!  We sat there for 3-4 hours drinking rum runners, and he was pretty good at keeping em coming but was real impersonal, which isn't a word that should be associated with bartender!

My husband ordered the beef soup with sliced noodles. Also had to try the pork and chive dumplings. The dumplings were amazing! The noodles I had were really good, but think there was too much oil and not enough spice. The noodle soup broth was very tasty and the beef was so tender! The noodles were thick and filling. I have a bit of carb overload right now.  The price is reasonable and the food is good. I'm interested in seeing what the other options on the menu are like. Will definitely be back again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Stopped in for breakfast, saw a huge line but was a single so was able to get right in and sit at thr bar.  This place was popping. Every plate I looked at looked like enough food for 2, as well as delicious. Their bloody mary's are a hit and they usually have about 2 giant buckets of the mix made. I ordered the Southern Breakfast, which came with 2 eggs, grits w/cheese, a friend green tomato, a biscuit and bacon. OMG!!.it was so tasty and filling for only $9. The biscuit wqs my favorite part. I would say this was my favorite breakfast I had while my trip in the city.  The prices range from $8-$14 per plate. I gave only 4 stars because the lady behind the bar who was serving me was not the nicest and seemed like she did not want to be there (she got nice when she handed me back my bill. Next time I am in New Orleans, I will be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"First time here last night, will definitely return! Was fairly busy, but we got a table with no wait. (Surprising for a Saturday night at 7pm)  Food was excellent! The guacamole is great for an app.  I had the Caribbean shrimp tacos for dinner, with street corn, and black beans. Was delicious. Big portions, I ordered three and could have done with just 2. The salsa bar and tortilla chips are great too.   My only gripes: Our waiter left something to be desired. The service was good, however he wasn't very personable. Another guy (thinking he must have been a manager) stopped by our table a few times though and was awesome.  Also didn't think the margaritas were all that great. All in all though, I look forward to going back and trying other things on the menu!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Definitely the best bbq we had in Nashville out of the 3-4 places we went to.   We were hungry early and our walk didn't talk as long as we thought.  Arrived 10 mins before opening and there were already a good 20 people lined up!  That's usually a good sign and come to find out, it held true!  You can walk up to the counter, take your #, and have them bring it to the table you choose.  Or go to the bar for full service.    We chose the bar and service was seriously amazing!  There was a guy and a girl tag teaming and they seriously had outstanding customer service!    We ordered the brisket platter with side salad and potato salad.   Brisket was a HUGE portion.  It was quite fatty but I suppose I could have asked for lean.  It was delicious.  Melt in your mouth, no sauce needed!   Side salad - just fine.  Potato salad was probably my favorite of all the ones we had.   Also had a 1/2 chicken (all white) platter with baked beans and broccoli salad.   The chicken was really moist and tasty! Baked beans were okay.   The broc salad was great.  I think that one may actually be my fave side now that I think of it.    Tons of seating. They had a nice heated outdoor patio with two bars.

But on a day of great sadness and emotional strife this diner shined like a beacon and delivered all of our cravings in perfect fashion and with very pleasant service.

"I was a little wary pulling up to park as the structure itself is super underwhelming. My husband said, ""You know it's authentic if it's a hole in the wall!"" Meh, I don't know if I share his sentiments.  Anyway, it didn't look great from the outside, but all was good on the inside. It was clean and comfortable. Far from fancy, but not bad at all. Actually, the food was great! Tasty and quick. I docked a star because the waitress was grumpy. To be honest, that doesn't always bother me, but it was almost like she had to force herself to not smile. My baby smiled at her and when she realized she smiled, she regretted it.   Also, the food is authentic, so if you're looking for Chilis food or Qdoba, go to Chilis or Qdoba, because that food isn't here.   So all that said, if you want yummy Mexican and don't mind a grump, go for it! You won't regret it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"My wife an I hit Salsa before a Guster concert at the Cannery Ballroom.  We honestly ate there for the free parking, but were pleasantly surprised with the food.  While Salsa is a great place to leave your car for a quick walk over to see a concert, it's also a fantastic place to sample some Latin cuisine.  I went with the Arroz con Poyo, which is basically chicken with yellow rice.  It sounds simple, but it is a delicious and filling dish.  The seasoning makes the chicken and it blends well with the rice.  It reminds me of a biryani-type dish you may have at an Indian restaurant.    The menu is a nice mix of regional dishes that may take a leap of faith on your part as well as some safer dishes for the more faint of heart.  We were in a bit of a time crunch, but I would like to go for a longer meal sometime.  They do have a bar and dessert menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

They were very accommodating and did not turn us away with only 20 minutes left of brunch time. The food came out super fast and the recommendations from both servers we spoke with were delicious.   I had the catfish and my friend had the frittata. We both tired the pineapple cider. The cider was a pleasant surprise!   The restaurant is very warm and welcoming on the inside, they also have some outdoor seating as well.   The bathrooms were clean! Definitely a plus.

"Came here with friends on a rainy Sunday, and we were lucky enough to be seated within the first few minutes. Immediate downside was that there were some place settings missing, so my friend had to flag down a waitress several times just to get a knife. That being said, the restaurant was also extremely busy, so I can understand why it might slip a server's mind.  The food was fantastic. Although the portions were on the smaller side, everything was seasoned perfectly. We ordered a cinnamon bun to split for the table, which was probably the best decision I made all day. It was still warm, huge, and dripping with icing. I got the bacon-cheddar omelette, which came with potatoes, toast, and a slice of watermelon. While I was a little disappointed with how little potatoes there were (I think there were less than 10 potato pieces on my plate), the omelette was delicious and everything had a lot of flavor.   To end the meal, my friends and I decided to get some pastries at the counter. The person there was nice enough to include a couple muffins for free, which really helped us end the experience on a high note. While the service was a little spotty at times and the food portion was a bit smaller than what I would've liked, I still walked away fairly full and very happy.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

There isn't a dedicated parking lot and you will have to find street parking. There are multiple restaurants right next to it so it's a bit difficulty. The service was quick but what really impressed me is the food. I've gotten the sandwich and the plates and you can't go wrong with either. The plates have the added benefit of getting a salad and hummus, but the sandwich is good for the price. The meat is really really well done, and the salad is pretty good. It's the right amount of chewy and has the perfect amount of spices.

Not greasy at all and a little spicy, but that's how they season it there. The okra was perfect tasty and fresh not slimy. I can't rave about the cole slaw it was pretty standard stuff much like KFC's. The servers kept checking on me to see if I needed anything, they were very friendly.

I tried the Felix which has gruyere, mozzarella, carmelized onions, and garlic. Great pizza, the dough is a killer texture. My only complaint about this one was that it was quite oily/greasy. I also had the Gail which is mozzarella, feta, kale, portabella and red onion. I must say I really like all their topping combintations, right up my alley.

"Everything from service to food was good but not exceptional.  This is one of those classic New Orleans restaurant that attracts more locals than tourists.  It's an old home located in a not so touristy part of town.  Reservations are made by contacting the restaurant directly...not available on opentable, resy, etc.  The restaurant is intimate and can be loud due to the space.  The hostess and servers are friendly and work as a team.  Warm bread with tasty whipped butter is served.  We had the catfish appetizer and while the fish was perfectly fried and tasty, there was too much sauce and we wished it was served on the side in a ramekin.  For entrees we had duck and the seafood platter.  The duck was delicious but slightly overcooked...the sauce and dirty rice were very good.  The seafood platter was good but the cornbread was a bit salty.  The fish was the highlight of the platter.  The desserts are a must...skip an appetizer if you must but definitely save room for dessert.  We tried the lemon ice box creme brûlée which was just the right amount of tart and sweet.  The pecan pie was by far the best pecan pie we've ever had.  Everyone raves about the caramel sauce but we thought the pecan pie itself was the star and definitely could have stood alone.

My waiter brought me hot sauce and ketchup before I even got my eggs which I was very thankful for. This place easily has five star service from the moment I walked in. I got the breakfast burrito which was huge and stuffed with cheese and chorizo, topped with guac and salsa. Was it the best breakfast burrito I've ever had?

"Had dinner with friends last Saturday evening and enjoyed the experience. I was stunned, however, how expensive the meal turned out to be. It reminded me why I typically prefer BYOs to full service restaurants. We had four appetizers (truffle pasta, sardines, beet salad and mussles), four entrees (duck, rabbit, steak and dorade), two drinks/glasses of wine each and two desserts (lemon tart and opera cake) and our bill came to $360, all in. Everything was fine, but nothing was outstanding or remarkable. As frequently the case, the appetizers outshined the entrees, except for the truffle pasta, which was mediocre. The sardines are very good, indeed, but have been on the menu since the restaurant opened. The mussles were very good, and so was the beet salad, but not particularly creative or pushing the culinary envelope in any way.  Of the desserts, the lemon tart was actually quite poor -- the crust was cold and too hard and the custard was too runny.  The opera cake was delicious though.  I will have dinner here again, but will either order more carefully or make it into a parents-in-law dinner night out.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

We we checking the food quality out for possible catering so we ordered a lot of different stuff.  ***** Special shout-out to TAYLOR D, who literally explained everthing on the menu and told us how all of the catering works. She was a fantastic server.  THE FOOD: BBQ shrimp appetizer, 3-side sampler with Gumbo, Jambalaya & sweet potato souffle, VooDoo chicken sandwich, Jerk Chicken sandwich, Jerk Chicken platter & bread pudding for dessert.  -BBQ shrimp. Ok, our whole party thought this was excellent. It is NOT however, what anybody would call BBQ shrimp. It's actually sauteed shrimp in a light seafood bisque type sauce with french bread on the side. Whatever it is, it was YUMMY! We ordered more bread to dip in the sauce (at Taylor's suggestion).  -3 side sampler plate. This is is lieu of a meat sampler plate. The Gumbo was good, the jambalaya was serviceable and the sweet potato souffle was excellent (warning-nuts). The sweet potato souffle can easily be a dessert. -Jerk chicken sandwich and platter. The jerk chicken was sliced moderately thin, not like lunch meat, but thin enough to be very tender. It had a good flavor without being too spicy. -VooDoo Po-boy sandwich. Basically a Po-boy with everything. Very, very delicious. -Bread pudding. Personally, I'm not a big fan of bread pudding (neither was anyone in our group). It has to be outstanding for me to like it. That being said, this bread pudding was a bit too wet and buttery (greasy) for me. I believe it was traditional bread pudding with a white chocolate sauce. I would call it average. I enjoyed the crispy bits of it, but not the middle.  (*** PRO TIP - For great texture on bread pudding, make sure your bread is super dry. Lt it sit out for a couple of days or put it in the oven on warm for some hours. You dont want it to darken, but have the texture of dry toast. )  This restaurant is connect to the Holiday Inn & Suites NOLA airport South (Saint Rose, La). If you are there for a few days there are enough items on their menu that you wont get bored.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"""Monster Monday"" Buy one import get on free (beers not cars) w/ what seemed to be some of the sexist karaoke people I have seen.  Plus $5 Grand Ma shots were a welcome surprise in glass.  They also offer free chips & salsa.  I have been here after 11 PM till 3 AM a few times now & must say the festive south of the border decorations are a nice change for a Monday late night.  The year round Christmas lights do not have the same funny tacky appeal this time of the year.  As a bonus, they do have plenty of flat screens for watching Monday Night Football.  They do have some interesting import beers to order.  (Some in oversized cans & most in bottles)  Overall this has been a good place to kill the Monday blues.  The crowd seems to be intent on enjoying themselves & each others karaoke.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"4.5 stars.  Their wine list needs some work - less grocery store wine and more eclectic offerings.  The grilled oysters and tuna nachos were excellent, as was the mahi reuben sandwich.

"Get the creamy jalapeno dip.  Just get it.  It's the best.  My girlfriend lives very close to Opry Mills, so Chuy's is a go-to for us.  We visit frequently, so I've experienced peak and off hours.  It's always been a pretty good experience.  If you go during happy hour, the chip bar can serve as a meal on it's own!  The burritos are great, as are the chips and salsa.  Margaritas always taste great, too.  Servers here vary, but all of them I've experienced do fine.  You do have a chance of getting someone who is over-the-top awesome at their job though.  I've had some real characters wait on me who are witty and cool AND refill the chips and drinks seemingly every time they pass by.    All-in-all a great after-work Mexican dinner, but not a special place for tourists, and I wouldn't wait 30+ minutes for a table, which can be the wait time on the weekends.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I'm going to try to be fair here and say Yummy House is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Tampa.  My problem is, and always will be, that I compare the Chinese food I eat anywhere with NY take-out Chinese, and that isn't fair.  There simply is nothing as good as take-out in NY, and as much as I may understand it is not authentic Chinese food and I shouldn't compare it, that is what I grew up with and that is what I know as good Chinese.  However, since I can't get that here, or presumably anywhere, I will try to judge this place on its own.  I was here with some friends on a random Wednesday, taking the opportunity to see a friend we hadn't seen in a while and to wish another couple a happy 25th anniversary.  Basically just a casual gathering.  Yummy House is perfect for such a gathering.  This location has a large dining area with a big open floor, perfect for large and small groups.  It is loud, but there appeared to be quite a few larger groups having a good time.  It is classy with regard to how it is decorated, but still casual and fun.  Service on our visit was less than stellar.  I won't kill them for it as this is a new location and they were slammed.  That said, our waiter disappeared for long stretches, it took us a while to order, and a while to get our checks.  Appetizers came out sporadically, though entrees all came out at about the same time.  Food was very good.  Again, I miss my NY Chinese food, but I need to get over it.  I ordered their crispy egg rolls, and I would avoid these if I were you (yeah yeah, I know i just said food was good; I'm getting to that).  Issue here is that a lot of Chinese restaurants serve egg rolls as what I would call a spring roll - very thin roll without much stuffing using a thinner wrap.  My idea of an egg roll is a thick wrap and a thick roll, like the circumference of your arm, and filled with veggies and, if you can get it, shredded pork.  Again, I am not in NY, which is obvious from the way people drive, the food, the lack of sarcasm, the lack of horrible accents...sorry, getting off track...anyway, the egg roll left a lot to be desired.  However, everything was very good from there.  As a table, we ordered 3 soups - the Hong Kong Wonton soup, the hot and sour soup, and a corn & crab chowder soup.  All 3 were delicious.  The wonton soup was, again, not what I would call classically good NY wonton soup...I'm sorry, really, I'm not trying to make the comparison, but I just can't help it...but regardless, I think you'll like it.  The other soups were also great, the hot & sour may even have better than the wonton. I couldn't tell you all of the entrees we ordered and shared, but I know I ordered the house lo mein (minus the calamari, but it still had pork, chicken and shrimp), someone else ordered kung pao chicken, pepper steak, I think, fried tofu, shrimp & scallops in XO sauce, fried rice, and other things and frankly, besides my order or lo mein, I may even have gotten the others wrong.  There were a lot of plates on the table and it was all delicious.  So again, I don't mean to be one of those people who say, ""I'm from [pick a state/country], and therefore, I know good XXXXXX.""  I hate that.  Just because you're from New York doesn't mean you know a good bagel.  Frankly, your taste might suck.  Therefore, I hate myself for acting like I am the arbiter of good Chinese food just because I ate it weekly growing up on Long Island.  Suffice it to say, as long as you acknowledge that you aren't going to get NY Chinese (or, I'd be willing to bet, San Fran Chinese food, though I have never had it), then I really think you'll enjoy Yummy House.  It helps coming with a group of friends who love to eat and will order the whole menu.  I highly recommend that.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I kept hearing almost weekly from my bf's bro about how great this place is and after reading a review of Sketch on a hamburger today (http://aht.seriouseats.com/archives/2011/01/sketch-burger-review-philadelphia-pa.html) I finally made it in for an early dinner. I was really surprised when we walked in...not at all what I expected it to look like! It's a little dive-y but cozy, also we were the only people in there which surprised me. We sat down and our waitress came over and told us to check out the specials and the menu. My boyfriend and I both decided to go all out with the Kobe burger, hey why not? I got mine with horseradish cheddar and my bf got his with bacon and American. We also got a large order of fries (make sure you get the aioli dipping sauce, it's free).  No fountain soda here-- just a very random selection of small bottles in a fridge. So we grab 2 and sit down. Our fries come out in about 5 minutes and they were excellent; thick cut, crispy & sort of Belgian style, with lots of flavor. I would kill for the recipe for the aioli dipping sauce - I couldn't get enough. We couldn't stop eating them and I was worried I wouldn't be able to even touch my burger. Soon after our burgers came out...My burger was cooked perfectly medium and very juicy, however there was soo much juice I had a bloody pool in the bottom of my container so the bottom bun was totally saturated and was a mushy mess but what can ya do?  Either way, it was a good burger, BUT it wasn't what I expected for the Kobe beef patty. My bf and I agreed it tasted like any other beef burger I've had in a decent restaurant.   I only have one complaint and that was the price... Our total came out to $30 without tip for 2 burgers, 1 order of fries, & 2 sodas.  The Kobe burger is $9.50 (YIKES!) and that is just the burger with lettuce and tomato...if you want cheese add $1 and any other toppings add another $1 for each. I would definitely get the regular sirloin ($6.50) next time...no need to upgrade to the Kobe.  A side note... Later on I was looking at the postcard menu I took with me and noticed it said American Kobe...so it's not the real Kobe beef I originally thought I was getting. Not that it's a huge issue or that I'm an expert on the topic, but should that still carry the high price and the name? I think American Wagyu is the correct term, but now I'm just being a huge food snob. :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Visited the restaurant at 1:00 pm on a Sunday. Started out with the house special of Tandoori Fish, Hyderabad Haleem and Schezwan Chicken noodles.   Everything about the fish was great except we felt as if there was little to no salt. Haleem tasted very good for something not made in India. The ghee was lacking a little bit however tasted good. Schezwan noodles was perfect level of spice (requested for Spicy).   The staff was very friendly and was helpful in picking out what to eat. Neat and clean-- definitely recommend it.

"I'll admit, I was a little worried about going to Scotty's Dawghouse after a Butler basketball game.  I went with a friend, and it was senior night, so she wanted to stay after the game and watch the festivities.  I agreed, as I thought that would ease postgame food traffic.  I was wrong.  Everyone stayed.  So I got nervous.  Low and behold, everything worked out!  It was busy, but we got a table without waiting.  I ordered a margarita (the special that night), and I had the burger of the month and a side of macaroni and cheese.  The burger happened to be a breakfast burger (complete with a sausage patty, spicy strawberry jam, an egg, bacon and a biscuit bun), and it was incredibly good.  The margarita and the mac and cheese left room for improvement, though.  I'd go back if I found myself at Butler, even after a basketball game.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"So I'm an English guy and in England you can't turn a corner without finding an Indian restaurant. I would argue that besides India, we have some of the best Indian food you can find. I've heard America isn't so great when it comes to Indian cuisine but I was craving a curry and this came recommended by my partner so we went to check it out. Boy was it good. The staff were super polite and attentive, making sure we had drinks throughout our meal and explaining the different dishes to my partner. The wait wasn't long and our food came out hot and fresh and my god, it was lovely. I had the chicken biryani which is a personal favourite of mine. The rice was a little moist looking which worried me when they brought it out but it was just as good as any biryani I've had in the UK. Fresh and flavourful with traditional spices, and perfectly mild like I had asked for. My partner got herself a spicy chicken tikka masala and boy was it spicy. I couldn't eat it but she loved it and ate every last bit of it. The garlic naan and keema naan were the only bit of the meal that wasn't amazing. Both were a little bland on the flavour (keema should have wonderful spices throughout) and the garlic naan was a little too charred in some places. The pilau rice was spot on too with subtle spices making it a joy to eat. It isn't the cheapest place to eat in Tucson but they really, really nail proper Indian food and are worth the spend.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"The food was good, but the wait staff could use improvement.  Monday night and it was slow, so we were seated immediately.  Ten minutes then passed before the server came for our drinks.  They seemed to realize they had left us waiting, because we were then bombarded by service from our server AND the hostess, neither of which knew what the other was doing. Food came out at a good pace, and was pretty good.  We had a Las Vegas roll, a samurai roll, mackerel nigiri, and tempura ice cream.  The miso soup was ok, the edamame and tempura were great.  I was surprised by the samurai roll which contained strawberries, but complimented the sweet eel sauce, and was very good.  The Vegas roll had too much cream cheese and I couldn't taste much else.  Mackerel nigiri was decent, but we are in the desert, and it was a Monday night, so quality was understandable.  Tempura ice cream was tasty, and looked very pretty, as did everything that came out.  The wait staff was very friendly, but they need to work on their communication, or have better management.

"I have visited this small subterranean restaurant several times over the years - its much better than in the past. You walk down stairs from the alley (Camac Street) to Terra, part of Tavern on Camac. You can hear the piano from the piano bar upstairs, which is not unpleasant. Also you hear chairs scraping and footsteps overhead as bar patrons walk around the bar. We were the only diners on a Sunday at 7:30 - the server was also the bartender and he said Sunday's are slow, which is fine with me as we had the entire place to ourselves. The restaurant is small - seats 34 max - and looks out at the basement bar in an adjacent room, which was populated with a few senior citizens, kvetching about their cable TV (we heard their entire conversation since the dining room was so quiet due to the lack of customers). The room is attractively decorated and has soft lighting. Food was great I thought - my partner had the buger/fries combo and the guacamole appetizer (they list ""small plates"" and ""large plates"" rather than appetizers and entrees). I had the scallops with a small brick of polenta in the center of the plate surrounded by a circle of scallops (is 5 scallops a bit miserly? - I wished there were a couple more) and for an appetizer the spinich salad. Everything was very tasty. We asked about coffee but the server said he would have to make a pot so we skipped it. There didn't appear to be any desserts - not listed on the menu or mentioned by the server. Thats Ok with me but my partner likes something sweet with coffee after dinner.   I would come back.

The only two negative things I could say is that the potatoes that came with the steak had no seasonings and were undercooked so I was a bit disappointed in that because I love potatoes and the music that they play in the bar area is way too loud!

On Tuesdays you can get any burger (beef, chicken, turkey, veggie patty or portabella mushroom) for just $1, toppings costs extra (bacon, guac, other sauces). I specifically like this Bar Louie over the one in Tampa because consistently I find the buns in these burgers are tastier. My bf and I always sit at the bar and we always get good service. Most times the bartenders are very attentive to our needs.  The happy hour here is pretty decent. Selected appetizers are half priced (boneless wings, flatbreads, bruschetta, etc), all beers on tap are $3 for small and $5 for large, I think and martinis are $5 each.

I have had their quail vietnamese style, and multiple soups.  Pork chop vietnamese style is also tasty.  I hope the vacant supermarkets adjacent to them fill.  Its a shame they are empty.  A favorite trip for me is getting lunch at Kim Son, then going across the street to the infamous Asian Farmers Market store for all my asian groceries. :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"The only place I've been able to find pasta in the 'center' of New Orleans/local Bourbon st area (outside of italian resturants).  I had the cajun jambalaya pasta, added blackened crawfish, and it was delicious. I think I can recommend anything blackened here: great flavor! The pasta was overcooked which was sad (ugg, soggy pasta). But the slightly spicy sauce and meats of the pasta were close in making up for it. The flavor was so good! The baguette slices were surprisingly delicious - perhaps a hint of the garlic butter used when cooking the oysters? I assume the bread was toasted on the same grill.  Fried eggplant was okay but a bit more mushy and underspiced than I'd like. I think Royal House still has the best fried eggplant.  I tasted the veggie pasta and the fried catfish and both are decent. Fries here are great :) Good, spicy hushpuppies.  Yummy chocolate cake; decent ice cream cake.  Sazerac: not sure how I feel about it. Very boozy, but still pretty smooth. I winced with every sip. You should be aware though that I'm not usually a fan of any whisky. ymmv.  Nice honest waitress (our table was warned against the red sauce for the pasta).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The decor, the console radio, the music, the hairstyles and dresses of the staff. LOVE. The only non-1940s items in the joint are the modern cash register/card reader and the availability of keto and gluten-free options. WHAT. Keto at a bakery? The keto items were actually why I showed up, although I guess the bakery made the news yesterday and there was a run this morning! Instead, I got donuts for my coworkers. We work at a history museum, so the idea of a retro bakery treat sounded perfect!   The donuts are deliciously fresh, and all items are made in-house. In addition to baked goods like donuts, cookies, brownies, and danish, they offer a few lunchy options like chicken salad that you can throw on one of their fresh croissants (they're in a fridge off to the right of the register, so go have a look). The bakery has limited seating (maybe 12-14 seats?), but you can sit for a spell with your treat and some coffee.

"Cheap food, cheap drink but amazing view! I really wish they would put more effort into their menus, your average beachside bar menu. The food isn't bad but they could step up their game and serve better quality dishes. The drinks are nothing great, basically they either come from a frozen cooler device or they are a cheap mixed drink you would find on a cruise. We only ordered appetizers, we had the island shrimp and the smothered fries. The shrimp where good, crispy and very flavorful. The fries where a massive serving, coveted in cheese, bbq sauce and pulled pork, really tasty!

"It seems we here in the Reno area are blessed to have good Mexican food. It is always fun to go to a new restaurant, so after catching a movie at the century summit sierra, we decided to have lunch at Miguels. This is a very big restaurant, easily could accommodate a very large group. I started out with a large margarita. When I say large, it was bigger than the normal margarita and like a small fishbowl. The way I huge the amount of alcohol in the drink is if I have a hard time getting to the car on my walker. On a scale of one to ten,  I would say this is a eleven. If I come here again and drink I will have to put bumpers on my walker. Thank god Peter was driving. For lunch I ordered a chicken taco and chicken enchilada. Both were good. The sauce on the enchilada could have been a bit stronger in flavor, and the taco lacked flavor. When I added salsa it really perked it up.

I ordered the zuppa de pesce and the pear/cranberry salad, which were both delicious, but the highlight of the meal was definitely dessert!

We saw that they had good reviews on Yelp and decided to try something new.  We both decided to start with a margarita and ordered the Cadillac and we both felt it was delicious.  They then brought us chips and salsa.  The chips were thick and not very tasty (I prefer thin, hot chips) and their salsa had an odd taste - I found out they put clove in it, definitely not something I would eat again.  I ordered their chicken tacos and have to say they were very good.  I am giving them 4 stars only because they were very friendly.  I plan to go back and give it another try.

"Only did lunch. Kind of an odd set-up, but it worked. Order in the back. Pick up food after your cellphone rings. I guess I was expecting to be stroked, seduced, and nurtured before reaching for my wallet. Ok, wrong establishment (that must be the place in Brooklyn, IL, where my old friend Sadie used to....oh, never mind). Just a little too casual, perhaps, given what one pays.   Open faced (""tartine"") sandwich was very good. Super high-quality prosciutto. Excellent mix of herbs and cream and whatever else was on it! Cold green soup (forget what it was) also nice. I like that the portions weren't huge.   Argula salad was fresh, but the dressing was terrible - a St. Louis epidemic, I think. Too bitter, too much lemon. No punch or pizzaz.

It was on the expensive side for one person and not a lot of food but very very tasty and different.   $45 (with tip) for a main course, side of potatoes, and desert.   At most restaurants, if I spend that much money I am taking home leftovers for 1 or 1.5 meals.  The main dish was a mushroom thing that was crispy and tasty.  I don't know what they seasoned with but it was great.  There was some kind of fluffy thing next to it (tiny size) that was also tasty and a green sauce.  Then I had a side of ""bar potatoes"" that were like small white potatoes almost oven crispy had a nice brown sauce.  The desert was also good.  I'd come again but not too frequently because of the cost.  I definitely will take friends with me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Prasino is a very trendy restaurant and I really enjoyed eating there. My friends and I hit this place up for brunch on a Saturday and we had a good time. Around that time they had both the brunch and lunch menus available so even though the menus were small, there was still a lot of variety.  I chose to order from the lunch menu and got Short Rib Tacos for $13.00. The tacos were really good, it tasted very authentic especially since they used corn tortillas and salsa that had just enough heat to spice up the flavors. Both of my friends ordered from the brunch menu, Short Rib Skillet for $13.00 and Paris Eggs Benedict for $12.00. They both said that they liked their dishes and aesthetically speaking, I can agree because everything looked super appetizing.  The prices may seem a little steep but the portions were decent and the restaurant just had a very nice ambiance. I loved even the amber glass bottles and cups that they used for water, very classy. My only issue is probably the slowness of service. It's a very big restaurant but it wasn't that packed so I don't know why it took about 25 minutes for food to come out. Our server checked on us a couple of times but his service wasn't outstanding which doesn't seem up to par with the upscale vibe of the restaurant. Other than that I will definitely go back when I am looking to dine somewhere in St. Charles.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Had some time for dinner before my 8 pm flight so I decided to eat here for dinner since the airport was only a couple miles away and I dont really wanna eat marked up airport food.  First off, the location of this place is kind of weird. Its in the middle of a industrial area and when you pull up to it, it kind of looks like a small warehouse. As you go through the entrance, go to your right for the restaurant. If you go straight, its the bar section.  The process to order is simple. Go up to the counter, order, pay, and wait for your food to be brought out to your table. While you wait, go get your drink. They have sweet tea, regular tea, and lemonade. They have RC soda products.  What I ordered was the three meat combo ($15.35). I chose Pulled Pork, Chopped Brisket, and Pork Ribs. Comes with Corn Bread and two sides. I chose Fried Okra and Tater Tots. All the meats were tender and flavorful. The ribs had some kind of rub on it that gave it a lot of flavor. The two sides were ok. The corn bread was a bit dry, even putting butter on it didnt help much. On your table you have access to five kinds of barbecue sauce. Georgia, Honey, Mild, Hot, and Nitro. I liked all of them except for the Georgia. It has more of a vinegar base taste to it.  Service was good by default because they bring out your food and you get your own drinks. I still tipped a couple bucks out of respect for the all the workers doing their jobs so I can have a good meal.  Some random info. They are open Mon - Tues 11 am to 6 pm. Wednesday - Saturday 11 am to 7 pm. Closed Sundays. I guess because of their weird location, they are not open that late. Yes they take plastic and the bathrooms are singular for men and women. Nice and clean too.  Overall, they got some decent barbecue here and the sauces on your table help accentuate the flavors.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but the burger was awesome.  The patty was tender and well seasoned, the bacon was crispy and super flavorful, and the lettuce was crisp and fresh.

"Finally tried out Rooster Soup, and it did not disappoint! A little diner style place under Goldie with amazing food and great wait service. We popped in for a quick lunch and was seated at the counter area. Note- even for lunch, a reservation is probably needed to snag a table. When we went, we were told the only available seating was either at the counter or the community table in the back. Hostess was not the friendliest, but understandably it was a busy time.   We got the Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich with fries added on and the Primal Supply Beer Braised Pork with an add-on of the Cauliflower soup.  Let me tell you, the soup is amazingggg. We started off splitting the soup,  and it was so creamy and flavorful. We decided that we're definitely coming back to try the other soups. The herbed tehina on the Chicken sandwich was delicious, and it was a pretty large portion. The braised pork sandwich was a smaller portion, but it was such a powerful flavor.  Our total ended up being a little more than $35 plus tip, so not exactly the cheapest for a quick lunch. We did get the add-ons just to try  it out, so perhaps without the fries and soup, it would be a little more ""quick lunch"" affordable.

The decor and atmosphere is inviting and hip - definitely feels like a place gears towards young professionals and college students. It was a lot larger than I had expected and while it was busy it didn't feel overly crowded. The space is used well.   The menu is impressive though there are some ingredients that we had to look up because we had never seen before! I think that Antipasti order sheet is a nice touch.   We shared the cheddar and pierogies and split the pub burger. Both were very good. We didn't order any cocktails this time around but their list was intriguing and we'd definitely like to try some in the future. We also shared the S'mores pudding for dessert - which was probably the best part of our meal.   The food was good but honestly I don't know that it's something to get overly excited about. What did really impress me was the service. Our server was quick, polite, open to offering suggestions since she knew we were first timers, and the restaurant gave us dessert on the house for coming in for the first time.

We had two orders of quesadillas - one chorizo and one beef.  Both were great. Started with lovely freshly made tortillas chips and a generous bowl of good, fresh salsa. The flavours were bright and just plain yummy.   The table service was quick and attentive, although we were there late afternoon and the place was almost empty.  What still needs work: the menu board is still a difficult read - both because its in Spanish and because of the writing style.

I ordered the Benedict and they were kind enough to swap out the bread for a bed of sautéed spinach which was nice of them to accommodate. The dish was ok, nothing to write home about, although the ham was very good and moist. It came with a large salad so the meal portion was very decent.  I ordered a matcha latte which is probably the worst I've ever had- watery and the coconut milk was hardly frothed. The matcha tea also didn't seem very good.

"Food is incredible - check out the menu - everything tastes just as good as it is described.  You have some traditional Italian dishes as well as ones with a twist.  It was my 1st time there and I definitely will be back.  Service was excellent; food was to die for.  The only thing I wish they would change is becoming more transparent about their 'specials' pricing.  Hubby wanted to order a special app (3 meatballs, stuffed with cheese, each with different finishing sauces - even though I don't eat red meat I couldn't resist - the 'Parmesan' one was soooo good.)  and this fell in line with the other app pricing.  I ordered the chicken parm from regular menu (obviously a sucker for red sauce and cheese) and hubby got the special 'Cowboy Steak' which was covered in caramelized onions and (I think?) was a porterhouse?  I'm not a steak cut expert, but hubby kept saying it had more than one type of steak or cut or something like that... so it was a big steak, and the presentation was great (seemed to be the trend with all of their steaks)....  BUT here is the kicker - this sucker cost $62!!! The most expensive dish on the regular menu (NY strip steak) is $35...so this special was almost 2x as much!  After living in NYC for some years, this would be on par with city pricing, but neither of us were expecting that in Bordentown.  Hubby said steak was VERY good, but we were both in sticker shock upon receipt of the bill.  1 app, 2 entrees, 1 beer, 1 wine, 2 espressos, and $132 later (before tip), we left with full bellies and a resolve to never order steak specials again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Solid buffet. Wanted something fast for kids, and this exceeded expectations. Hibachi grill decent, although no sauce-options like a Mongolian BBQ, but it's not supposed to to have that. Sushi rolls were good, lots of veggies, avocado, and a little fish but great compared to most grocery store options (which was our 2 option for the evening). I did like that the manager was closely monitoring the buffet and as favorites got low, he had staff on top of it.   Things I always get and rate on Asian Buffets: Green Beans, Chicken Wings, Roasted/Smoked Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Crab Rangoons, Sweet 'n Sour soup (just needed a bit more pepper, found on our table). All hit mark except Crab Rangoons which I like with more filling and a bit browner.   What will have me go back is their Hot Pot ~$21 pp. Kinda tough to enjoy with our 4 kids under 10 yrs old and their needs of multiple trips to buffet and bathroom.

The restaurant was dim and small.  It would be a romantic place for a dinner date, but it was kind of loud and the tables were close together along the wall.  Also, the service was very slow that night.  I am not sure if it is always slow or if maybe they had more customers than usual?   Anyways, we ordered the wild mushroom risotto arancini for an appetizer and it was pretty good! It was flavorful and cheesy. We also ordered the famous spaghetti and meatballs and was not disappointed. It was a mound of pasta with two big meatballs. The pasta and sauce were very good and had bits of shredded beef or pork in it.  The meatballs were decent, but it wasn't as flavorful as I hoped. The Sunday Gravy dish was good as well.  For dessert, we had the tiramisu, which was not a typical tiramisu. It was more of a tiramisu flavored cheesecake, but it was still good! It was something different and yummy.  I would recommend trying it if you like cheesecake!   Unfortunately, this restaurant is not BYOB.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
I like to go down forth because you can always find a place that is having a good time and Che's is definitely one of those places! This is like a dive bar that is known by everyone.  It is very small and sometimes you do have to stand because it is packed with people but they always have great drink specials and the staff is very nice.   It is a little collegey and can be very loud but it is always a good time!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I came here for the first time in 7 years and as a result of that I ended up ordering every single burger that they had on their menu.   I ordered the regular hamburger, hamburger with cheese, jalapeno cheese burger, bacon cheese burger, chicken breast burger, chicken wing burger, and fish burger.  We also ordered a sack of onion rings and smothered fries to go.  My friends ordered a 10 sack and 5 regular cheeseburgers as well.   We brought the burgers back home to eat, and upon opening the bun I realized that the meat is smushed and processed into an inedible looking food item. If you don't open the bun you are fine, so I would suggest you to not look at the actual meat because it will make you not want to eat the burger.  The chicken breast burger and the jalapeno cheese burger were my favorite.  The onion rings here have a very thick batter, and the smothered fries were dripping in sauce.  They were kind of gross and I don't think I will get the fries ever again.   Prices are a bit higher than before around $1.50 for each burger, and you need at least 3 or 4 to be full.  I would come to White Castle before going to other fast food places though because its' more affordable to try many different types of burgers here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I walked into Sultan Palace on a whim last night, just looking to get a takeout falafel sandwich.  I was informed that they just opened this past Monday, and they're still getting set up in the back.  The dining room is set up and very nicely remodeled.  For such a large space, they did a good job of making it decently cozy - I think the addition of some rugs on the walls and more pillows in the windows would warm things up a bit more in preparation for the coming chill.   The place was empty (it was early) and the staff was around the register.  Everyone was very welcoming and helpful, I ordered my falafel and some baba ganoush to-go.  I was offered some hot tea which had a beautiful sage aroma and was already sweetened.  I was offered a seat in the dining room and sipped on my tea while my food was prepared.  My order was ready by the time I was done with my tea. The baba ganoush was beautifully prepared - a little bit soupy with the perfect amount of garlic coming through and hitting you in the face.  The pitas (home made) are puffy and doughy - thicker than what I'm used to, but they worked well for dipping and even for the sandwich.  The falafel did not have a crunchy exterior, but the flavor was spot-on - the added tahini, lettuce, tomato and pickled veg (I think it was a pickled slaw) added the tang that I was looking for.  I have no doubt that the sandwich would have been even better had I eaten in.  Here's the kicker - it's sooooo cheap!  I was astounded at how low the prices are - I paid less than $9 for that meal and was stuffed.  So if you find yourself in Dutchtown South, give Sultan's Palace a try.  I'm excited to go back and try more off their menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Delicious pho, fast service and great space. I've never done fast-casual pho and I have to say I'm a fan. I stopped in here for lunch one day and got takeout which was packaged pretty well (all separate) and held up for transport, walking a few blocks.  The price is great and I really liked the ordering screens - if you know what you want it can be really fast, or if you want to peruse for a few minutes you can do that too. There were also a lot of pictures so you can see what you're getting - if you haven't checked yelp first!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"We had tried this place in Atlanta and absolutely loved it, so we were really excited when we heard that they were opening in King of Prussia! A few weeks after they opened, we decided to stop by for dinner one evening and see how it stacked up versus the one we had loved so much in Atlanta.  Our experience here was really great overall, but the tacos weren't all quite to the same level as those we'd had in Atlanta. In particular, the fish taco in Atlanta absolutely blew my mind. Although the one here in KOP was a good fish taco, it was missing a little something that made the one in Atlanta just amazing. All the other tacos tasted great, though, including the duck and carnitas! We started our meal with a quesadilla, which was also wonderful!  In addition to the tacos, we also ordered one of the non-alcoholic drinks, the ginger grapefruit agua fresca. We had tried and enjoyed the other two in Atlanta, and we loved this one as well.  Even though I didn't love the fish taco as much as the one in Atlanta, I still enjoyed the tacos and would definitely go back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

This is a great quick on your way home for a decent dinner and may I compliment the young lady there with the tattoos she saw i realy wasn't sure of what i wanted and she helped me decide (2) the food i ended up getting the chicken wings not fried I belive they were baked and seasoned well lots of fries (normally if the fries are not peeled from a potato I won't eat them and being from chicago i can smell real fries without opening the bag)but these were hot and i had a few.  But the chicken was the star here i also had a gyro with extra meat this is the only place i would go back too and i have been to the greek festival on forest park for 10 yrs and  they cannot even get close... my positive review starts when i walk in a restaurant till i walk to the counter this is very important on if i will come back and the one lady with the tattoos just went above and beyond made sure my order was correct and mademe smile while i was there but the food also kicked ass too,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"My wife chose Longhorn for our 39th anniversary and I am glad she did. To avoid a wait, we went about 1:30 and got right in. I was pleasantly surprised by how roomy and not overly loud this steakhouse is. Much better than the other chain steakhouse I used to frequent. The roomy aisles and comfortable booths with real legroom were obvious with a fairly rustic, attractive decor. Our wonderful server, Tatjana, immediately brought menus and took our beverage orders. Having checked out the menu ahead of time, I knew I had to try the 12 oz. NY Strip steak and my wife had the same. Tatjana brought fresh, warm bread immediately and crispy salad greens with a bit of red onion, chopped fresh tomato, croutons and shredded cheese with just the right amount of dressing soon followed.  We no sooner finished the bread and salad when our stea ks and bakers arrived. I always order steak medium rare and it generally misses the mark. Not at Longhorn! PERFECTLY done, tender and extremely juicy. Like others have said, it was just a bit oversalted in one part of my steak but not enough to consider even a drop of steak sauce to cover the flavor. I will specify easy on the salt next time. This was still the best steak I have had in a very long time. We ended our meal with their Caramel Apple Goldrush. Fresh baked pie crust packed with sweet apples, topped with vanilla nobean ice cream, and drizzled with caramel and raspberry sauce left me overstuffed, but happy. The food and the perfect service from Tatjana puts Longhorn Steakhouse on my go again list.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"​We're St Pete locals, and when things quiet down over at the beach, we love to head over and support local businesses. We were actually there in early June but had been traveling so I'm a little behind.  It's nice that they have a decent amount of parking behind the building, which is not always the​ case.  The appearance is a little deceiving because​ of the awning over the outside dining tables. The restaurant is beautiful inside with amazing​ stain glass doors and metal sculptures.  We were greeted by the hostess and quoted about 30-minute​ wait, offered a pager, and told about small bar outside. The bar area is outside​ to the left facing the building, and unfortunately,​ the area is pretty​ narrow with just a few seats. Most people gathered in the foyer, making it impossible for servers to get through with food and dirty​ dishes.  At just under 30 minutes our pager bussed and we were escorted to a table. The dining room is smallish with a metal sculpture divider through the middle, breaking​ us some sound and sightlines of the other tables. We never felt like we were sitting on tip fo the next table.  Our server came over immediately and offered drinks - unfortunately,​ I missed the beer and wine part of the concept and ordered gin and tonic. ​LOL, I had a 3 Daughters Key Lime Cider which was fresh, light and refreshing.  Our server brought us over a basket of flatbreads with a roasted pepper dip. Both were delicious; they should package the crisps!  We both decided on the Fisherman's Platter with fried shrimp, bay scallops, fish and a deviled crab cake. It was served with a small pile of fries and a side of homemade coleslaw​.  Everything was crisp, well seasoned, and not greasy; the coleslaw​ was light and not overdressed​​ or overly sweet.  Being raised in the business, I for good or bad hear and see everything around me. The good is that all of​ the servers know the menu inside and out and can make suggestions and knew about possible allergies. ​The bad is that the expeditors​ line/food​ pick up area is open to the dining room and was badly in need of sweeping with trash all over the floor.  Food and service were first-rate​ and probably warranted 4 1/2 stars. The cleanliness​ of the service line and congested lobby kept them from 5 stars.  But, we'll absolutely be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Like many restaurants in Phliadelphia that I love, Sbraga has an intimate atmosphere with a view of the kitchen. The service was great - my water cup was never empty - and not to mention, Chef Sbraga was super down to earth and charming.   I went after enduring 2 hours of lecture, which, of course, warranted a drink (or more). I ordered the Monticello Vineyard (bourbon cocktail) per our waiter's recommendation. I normally don't like bourbon but decided to try it because the waiter was so enthusiastic about it. What a pleasant surprise!! I think I took a sip and then gobbled it down...like a lady of course.   My friend and I both decided to do the 4 course tasting menu for $49. We both got the fois gras soup for the first course, which was rich and flavorful and wonderfully balanced. Sometimes it is really hard for me to handle more than 2 bites of fois gras but I gobbled down the soup in like 2 seconds...again... ladylike.  For the second course I ordered the Octopus with piri piri and tapenade and my friend ordered gnocchi with escargot in tom ka gai. I was not impressed with the octopus (minus one star), the texture was chewy, and the tapenade overpowered the piri piri. I was expecting extreme heat but all I tasted was olive. My friend's gnocchi, on the other hand, had a great texture, and I thought the flavor was interesting, creative, and surprisingly, pretty good.   I ordered the meatloaf (signature dish per waiter) and my friend ordered the pappardelle with rabbit for our third course. The meatloaf was a tiny bit on the salty side but the texture was marvelous. My friend's dish lacked in presentation but made up in taste. The pasta tasted super fresh and made me happy!!!!  For dessert, I got the hazelnut praline and my friend ordered the rice pudding. We both enjoyed our dessert and left feeling full, which is a HUGE consideration for me for tasting menus.   Overall, a great dining experience!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I had heard some good things about this place so I gave it a go since I was near the area. This small, local, and black owned restaurant is located in a strip mall with a hair salon, furniture store, and a nightclub. Its food truck is sitting outside making it easier to spot. The dining area is closed due to COVID so currently it's pick up only. The young lady taking orders wore a mask and there was a plexiglass shield in front of the register. A small fridge housing the cold dessert offerings sat on the long counter along with other sweets. Menu is on a large chalkboard behind the counter. I decided to try their Friday fish special. The options are a 2 piece catfish or whiting or 5 piece perch. I chose the catfish. The meal comes with fries, coleslaw, and a drink for only $10. After placing the order for two meals, I had about a 10 minute wait. They present the meal to you in its container for viewing before bagging it up. The fish was fried just right to my liking and everything was seasoned well. While waiting, I heard 3 call in orders come in for chicken Alfredo so I'll probably try that next time I'm on the west side.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Hands down, best pizza in town! I have been ordering Funky Pickle pizza for years, and I will continue doing so. If you are looking for a break from your regular same old-same old pizza, give Funky Pickle a try. At first glance, the ingredients in some of the pizzas sound bizzare. For example, who would have thought that putting marinated artichokes or zucchini on a pizza will result in a great taste? Well, it does. Funky Pickle's pizzas taste unusual and delicious. The crust is thin and never dry, the toppings are fresh and go well together. Some of the pizzas I can recommend are Greek, Funky Chicken (one of the best!) and Lonely Hearts. If you choose to eat at Funky Pickle rather than ordering take-out or delivery, you can purchase pizza by the slice. This comes especially handy if you are dancing the night away at Whyte avenue night clubs, and need a quick bite.

We usually prefer to eat at a table, just because you don't end up smelling like you were cooking all evening when you come out of the restaurant, but that's just us.

"This place is like a hidden gem! I came here for dinner and the ambiance was great. Dim lighting, with a silent black n white movie playing in the background. The staff was friendly. We came kind of late (8pm) since they closed at 9, but everyone was still really nice. We ordered 3 appetizers and one entrée (we prefer smaller dishes). Its my first time eating French food in like a year, so i was really excited.  we got the Diver Scallops, Pate, Slow roasted Tripe, and braised lamb shank  I must say the Tripe is definitely a winner! Its slow cooked with season vegetables to tender perfection. Garnished with fresh Parmesan cheese. It was probably the most mind blowing dish of the entire meal. I was taking their really yummy bread and soaking up the remaining sauces. THAT should tell you how delicious it was. If you've never tried tripe and want to give it a go, i would definitely recommend coming to Petit Valentien. The owner/chef even came out and pointed at the devoured tripe dish and give us the thumbs up. He obviously knows we loved the dish.   The diver scallops were delicious as well. Perfectly cooked and garnished with this Asian flavored sauce. But it definitely couldn't outdo the tripe.  The braised lamb shank was delicious. FALL OFF THE BONE TENDER! Usually lamb has a very distinct flavor a lot of people aren't a fan of, but the way this was prepared you only get a small hint of the lamb flavor, the rest was just mouth watering goodness.   Overall this place definitely deserves 4.5 stars! great fooood and great service! worth a visit!!!  recap: 1) TRIPE!!! 2) chill ambiance 3) TRIPE!!!!!!! 4) Braised Lamb Shank!!! 5) TRIPE!!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Disappointed because this place is no longer what it used to be. This was my first visit to Boise in two years and although this place wasn't in the same little parking lot shack, it was still in the same shopping area and still owned by the same person. With that said, the taste was still there but the portions are significantly less than what they were two years ago. In addition, the chicken was way too thin and too overcooked! They were also out of the Korean short ribs that day. Total bummer!  We got a tray of chicken teriyaki, a tray of beef teriyaki, and a mixed plate consisting of pulled pork, beef, and chicken. Both of the trays of meat were just sad! The mixed plate was half decent but with the chicken overcooked and the pulled pork too dry! The coleslaw and macaroni salad were okay, not out of this world, but just okay.  The best tasting thing that we ordered was the coconut curry. It was delicious and the portion was decent for the price. This gets five stars!  The Shak gets four stars because they're an islander company and the taste of the food itself it yummy. However, I would really give it a two because I was way less than impressed with how the portions have changed in two years and how overcooked and dry the food was.  Service was great and the price for all of this was about $35.

"Came here at 5:30 on a Tuesday during restaurant week. They are on Open Table which is always a plus for me. We were seated immediately upon arrival by a nice and friendly hostess. Our server came over in an appropriate amount of time to take our order.   This place is pretty huge in my opinion and offers a variety of rooms, each offering something different in terms of ambiance and decor...which I appreciate. The front area where the bar is has a really cool vibe. It's old school but sort of gothic. It reminds me of the tower of terror for some reason. Lol. I don't know why. I wish we were seated up front. The back room was nice, too. There's one window seat that I would have loved to sit at but it was already taken. It was verrrry quiet for the majority of time that we were there. As we were leaving around 7:30 it was full and VERY loud....to the point that it was difficult to hear each other. Some of the other rooms were still quiet. I think you can choose a room based on your desired ambiance (if you know going into it).   Chips and salsa were brought to the table...chipotle salsa and a fresh pico. Both were delicious.   We ordered from the restaurant week menu.   Apps: I got the mushroom and black bean empanadas. My Dad got the dual empanadas so 1 mushroom and 1 beef, (each one cut into two pieces). I thought they were really good.   Entrees: my Dad got filet and shrimp. He gave it 8 out of 10 stars. I got cheese enchiladas with tomatillo sauce. Both served with rice and black beans. My enchiladas were delicious. I would have preferred a bit more sauce but that's a personal preference. I did not ask for more but I'm sure they would have brought it. They were very cheesy. Yum!  Dessert: Dad got Tres Leches cake and I got Chocolate Mousse cake. It was not the best I've had. It tasted pre made. Like something that would be shipped to a restaurant and they would slice and serve. I could be wrong. It was alright but not great.   Our server was excellent. She answered all of my questions and offered suggestions. She checked to make sure everything was correct and delicious. She took care of the check quickly when my Dad was in the bathroom so I could beat him to it. The person assisting her was also great. Quick to clear plates and wrap up leftovers. Friendly. Non intrusive.   The bathrooms were clean. Four stalls. No waiting. Sinks were clean. Toilets were clean and functional.   I was sad they didn't have Chambord to make a Chambord Margarita. We ordered sparkling water. I was sad it wasn't really cold. The waitress did bring me a straw and lime like I asked, which I appreciated because many people forget.   Can't beat restaurant week. It's just a coincidence we came here during restaurant week. We looked at the regular menu, too but ultimately preferred the restaurant week offerings anyway. 3 course meal for 2 people, $79 plus tip.

Many people stopped in just for the Gelato, which is DELICIOUS, but I digress. I went in also to take at look at the interior, which is nice and cool place to lounge for a little bit as you enjoy your gelato.

The pad kee mow had a few more veggies in it than what it stated on the menu but I was very okay with that. The veggies were fresh and crisp. I hate when they are too soft so I love that they had a little bite to them. I've taken it upon myself to become an expert in drunken noodles. I am attempting to visit every Thai restaurant in the Greater New Orleans area. These were solid. In my rankings, they hold third place right now behind Thai Ocha and La Thai. The service was good here and it was very quiet. The place was cleanly as well. I definitely would like to go back and explore more of the menu. Sidenote: I LOVE their bowls and wished I could smuggle a couple away in my purse hehe.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Always a fan of their thin crust pizza.   I have never been disappointed with a Grimaldis. Well, ok, I'm disappointed that the Grimaldi's at Citrus Park Mall closed, but I've never been disappointed with my meal at a Grimaldi's. I made a reservation for four on Sunday night, but that was definitely unwarranted - the place was almost completely empty.  Even though I'm pretty sure we were the only reservation, they still seated my friends who got there first at a different table than they seated my husband and me! Luckily through texting we realized we were both there, just at different tables.   There were four of us (two guys, two girls) so we decided to split a 16 inch white garlic pizza, a 16 inch regular pizza with meatballs, and a large Caesar salad. There are six large slices to each 16 inch pizza so we all ended up with three pieces of pizza and some salad. We each ended up eating two pieces of pizza, but I bet I could have eaten a third, I was just being polite. (We took home two pieces so I got to eat them the next day anyways).   I'm so glad the meatballs are made of beef because they are delicious! The white garlic pizza definitely has a strong taste of garlic, which I wanted. Both pizzas really hit the spot. The salad is a great way to start as well.   Grimaldi's is a little pricey, but it also bills itself as gourmet pizza. I enjoyed the meal and I will definitely be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"It looks like they have good drink and appetizer specials on Monday to Thursday. We were there on a Saturday. Ordered appetizers: coconut shrimp, beef empanada, a crab/avocado . All were very good and a good amount of food. We ordered a salad with fruit which was full of fruit and was large serving. Ordered the light/small order of the shrimp and maihi maihi and it was very good and the right size if you are ordering appetizers. We ordered the 3 drink samplers : vodka and tequila. It was a nice way to sample the 3 different drinks. However I think the amount of alcohol in each drink could have been more.

THIS IS A CASH ONLY RESTAURANT. luckily with had $20 so it was perfect for two people!  Their tortillas are delicious! I love a good handmade tortilla. The tacos were good but it lacked flavor. Great quality meat and tortilla, but the additional sauces didn't really do anything for me. They give a LOT of meat and I was able to make two tacos out of one!

"I was in the mood to try something new, but not spend too much money. This place certainly obliged. Walking it, it is a clean place that sticks to the whites and greys - by far the most common color trend of the season. We order our food and the hostess is extremely nice, though obviously flusterd. She is probably more honest with us than she should be stating that they were not expected to be so busy and so popular when they opened. They are understaffed in the kitchen and they don't yet know how to order for the large volumes of customers they have been having, so some nights they have had to close early/close in the middle of the day in order to restock. She warned us that the wait time will be about forty-five minutes, which was perfectly fine. My favorite part about the service was that they had a condiment bar on the side were you could get your own condiments, water, to-go boxes, etc. It was a really nice set up. The food was really good. We ordered the crab puffs which were crispy and well seasoned, though not a lot of crab (fairly typical). My boyfriend got the spicy brisket where the meat just fell apart. It was juicy, rich in flavor, and you  could cut it with a chopstick. I got the wonton soup. Everything in it was well cooked (though the shrimp was a little overcooked) and extremely well seasoned. The best part was the barbecue pork. Holy shitake mushrooms those were good. They were rich, sweet, yet salty...had a crispy bark. I could eat a whole platter of that stuff. I have had a lot of barbecue pork in my life, but never better than that one. I hope that this business learns the roles quickly and end up on top. I like their food and so far I like them and I hope they do well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"5 star burger!  Came here on a week night, I heard this was an awesome burger spot, I personally liked the concept, and couldn't wait to draw something. Walking in, it was not what I was expecting, totally no frills. It was a little tight, you walk in seat yourself, the booths are a little cramped, we started out in a church pew booth, but ended up moving to a table with chairs.  It was cold inside, so we probably should have sat outside, it was a nice evening, but I rarely eat outside due to fear of bugs.   The waitress, came over gave us the run down of how things worked, self serve drinks, board with specials, and another with desserts and milkshakes.  Mmmmm milkshakes, I originally had no plans on getting one but just her saying the word mad me instantly want one.  I mulled over the menu.. I decided to keep it simple, best way to see how good the burger actually is.. I went for the Kobe with cheddar, small fries w/ Aioli on the side and a strawberry milkshake.   Ok now that my order was out of the way time to work on my masterpiece... Sorry to say, that after looking at all the cool art on the wall I entered a mental block, the intimidation was real, I would have enjoyed a coloring book but I guess it's not, coloring burger, sigh.. alas, my milkshake came.. it was decent, a little less strawberry tasting than I would like.  I grabbed a can of Dr. Pepper and started thinking about the burger.. My muse burger man! I started drawing... and out came the fries shortly followed by the burgers.   I ordered a small fries but I guess they use the same container for both sizes, not a great idea, kind of looks like someone just wanted to cheat me out of fries.. might be a marketing tactic to get you to order a large next time, eh idk.. On to the kobe burger.. I got my extras (lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo) on the side, I just wanted to try the burger itself.. took the first bite Success! It was delicious! I fixed my burger with the right amount of extras and the aioli sauce which is truly amazing and enjoyed my meal! The fries were good I used the aioli sauce which I will say again was amazing.  I'll be back, I have another masterpiece idea brewing, the burger and aioli inspired me, lol.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
Good location right off 4th street. Walked in and was immediately greeted. Friendly staff. Maybe a little too friendly. The manager walked from behind the counter and was in my bubble explaining the menu then proceeded to gently touch my arm. Weird. But that's okay she's just being nice!  Food was great. Had the cinnamon bun shake to share and ordered the 24/7 burger and the cheesy. DELICIOUS!! Good proportions of bun to burger. Fresh. And fast. The only downside is the trash can was full to the brim when we left and felt awkward as the staff is standing around as we are trying to toss our trash into a can that is already full. Aside from that the food was really good and we will be back. Good burgers and shakes for a reasonable price.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Come for brunch or dinner, the menu is great, and the atmosphere is authentic!   I ate brunch here on Sunday, after the famous Broad St run.  The wait was long, but for good reason, because there was an extra 40k people in the city that day, and everyone wanted to dine outside.  Despite the long wait times, the staff were super friendly about everything, and did a great job keeping us updated about our status.   Food was really good.  The guacamole appetizer was amazing, including the special with bacon, goat cheese, and raddish. Yumm!  I had speical tacos, with pork carnitas and jackfruit salsa. It was very good!  The breakfast burriots were enourmous, probably as large as my head.  My friend wasn't as fond of the egg & spinach tacos, stating they were quite bland.  The watermelon margarittas were delicious, and so was the jalepeno cucumber margarita.  Also, I loved the verde salsa! Not too spicy so I could actually eat it!

"This restaurant is at an awesome location on the main drag of Carpinteria, walking distance from the beach, with a wonderful outdoor dining area.  We had initially wanted to order some oysters, but they were grossly over-priced at this restaurant.  So we gave the smoked fish rillettes a try, and we were pleasantly surprised at how much we enjoyed them.  The seeded flatbreads were boldly seasoned, but not too much to over-power the smoked fish.  I had the squid ink mafaldine as my main course.  I thought the pasta was nice & al dente, and the squid ink had a nice richness to it.  However, the spicy uni butter was a little underwhelming -- I was expecting a little more uni flavor, but the sauce was almost mostly just butter & chili flakes.  Definitely needed more uni, and perhaps something fresh to cut the richness like more fresh parsley (as opposed to just spiciness from chili flakes).    If I'm ever in Carpinteria again, I would love to come back and sample their other dishes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Us and a bunch of friends went here New Year's Eve for dinner. We did this last year and had so much fun that we thought we would do it again this year. Unfortunately, the experience wasn't as enjoyable this go around. We come here a few times throughout the year and we know that service here is slow and that dinner can easily take upwards of three hours. This is normally OK as we are out with friends talking, laughing, and generally having a good time. On this occasion, the service was painfully slow. We arrived at 6pm and by 10pm, we still were not served our dinners. It wound up being close to 10:45 when we got our meals. Many of us had babysitters that we told we would be home around 9pm. Two of our friends had to leave before they even got their entrees while the rest of us ended up scarfing down our entree as we needed to get home. While I can accept a certain level of slow service, this was just ridiculous. Given that I'm sure everyone there had reservations, you would have had to have known how many people were going to be there and you need to adjust accordingly. The problem is there is just one person doing all of the cooking and when the place is packed (which it was), you need to know when to call in help.

"Three stars for the food, five for the service, equals a four.  Service was top notch, and five star--place settings and table service, timing, placement of accoutrements etc., were all consistent with traditional fine dining norms.  Phenomenal wine list, with fair prices (though I was drinking at the time.). They have fantastic wines by the glass, and ""tastings"" of some ultra high end wines, e.g., I saw a 2010 Paul Hobbs cab, 1oz tasting for $13 (its $300/bottle.)    Server was very informed/knowledgeable about the food offerings, and really knew what she was talking about.  Bread was good--served with butter topped with smoked salt.    Lobster was underwhelming--and served with unsalted drawn butter, and no lemon.  Lobster itself was on the more chewy side, and lacked flavor.  Was served with lobster risotto which was very good, but needed something?  Added lemon to it and it was better.  Lobster almost seemed *reheated* to me, maybe it was maybe it wasn't.  Filet--also underwhelming.  While tender, didn't melt in your mouth like it should.  Was under seasoned.  Could have been a sirloin for all I knew.  Served with bone marrow--very underwhelming.  Red wine reduction/sauce was just okay.  Chipotle creamed corn was good.  All in all, meal was okay, but for $120 (no alcohol) was on the very underwhelming side.  There is much better surf and turf at other high end establishments.  Wasn't bad, but was expecting to be wowed based upon the reviews, and I wasn't.

It was very good with a nice balance of flavors except for the addition of incredibly salty kalamata olive slivers. On to the main, I opted for the burger which was coated with a nice melt of cheddar and caramelized onions. It retained its juiciness nicely and was quite pleasant and large size.

"Being deprived of Korean food and it being cold AF, i decided to get some DuBu. The banchan was set up beautifully, and the flavors were what I expected it to be. I loved the fried sweet potatoes. They give me life. The fish was a little on the small side, but given that it was a complementary side dish, who am I to complain? I ordered the Dumpling Soondubu. For you soondubu noobs, never reject the egg. They crack that egg in there, and I submerge that thing in the soup to quicken the cooking process of a beautiful poached egg. The flavors of the soup was delicious, but the dumplings were just okay. There was nothing special about it and the skin was too delicate. It ended up falling apart in my soup. If I were to go again, I would go with a different soondubu.   My husband ordered the Jeyuk Dubu Kimchi, which was a sight to behold. He enjoyed the flavors, but I found it underwhelming (probably because I'm Korean and He's white. He don't know the nuance of Korean food). The pork was not tender as I expected pork loin to be. It seemed more like pork belly. The flavors were still good, don't get me wrong. But for stir-fried kimchi with some pork, I think $19.99 is a lot to ask for. However, it did last us several days for leftovers and I enjoyed every last bit of it. So, obviously i wasn't THAT underwhelmed.   If I was back in the west coast, Dubu wouldn't knock my socks off. But because there seems to be a dearth of Korean food in the Philly area, I guess I'll have to take what I can get. Beggers can't be choosers.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"My favorite thing about Meshuggah is the dive style atmosphere and the colorful mix of people. And that everyone is either reading, studying, working on a laptop or having some sort of intellectual discussion. Oh, and a few regular people just hanging out are always there too.   Expect to find most of the tables filled, laptop charging power cords snaking the floors to the nearest power strip and an unbelievably steep set of steps up to the bathroom. Sidewalk seating too for the more social crowd who doesn't need access to electricity.   I'm not all that impressed with their menu, but it's ok because all a cafe needs is one thing on the menu that I adore, and here it is the toasted pesto & fresh mozzarella cheese on a bagel.  I find their espresso style coffee is way too strong for me, but the beer collection makes up for it. The result is you are more likely to find me hanging out in the afternoon or evening at Meshuggah while I blog away.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Annabella's is a very small Italian restaurant that seats about 35 people and is located directly across from the Riverside Theater in historic Bristol Boro.  It is a good place to have a meal before a show at the riverside. It is owned and operated by a friend and former high school classmate.  The restaurant is named after the owner's grandmother.  Annabella's offers many good Italian dishes and has many different specials nightly in addition to the regular menu. If there is a negative, it is that they use imported pasta ( it kills me to use that word instead of macaroni) and not homemade. The macaroni however is always done just right and not moosh.  In addition to dinner, they make an old fashion tomato pie that is out of this world and is good either hot or cold.  You can order the tomato pie as take out.  Also, there is always an ample supply of broccoli - rabe, fried long hot peppers, and cushca peppers, which are long hot peppers that are allowed to turn red on the vine, then dried and fried. You have to ask for the peppers, they are not on the menu. These three item always make me a happy camper.  The peppers are locally grown by another friend and former classmate of mine who has a large garden. Annabella's is BYOB and does take reservations.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I was a bit nervous to try this place based on reviews but, I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience.   I got my food to go. I ordered the lobster boil, snow crab boil, and a side of mushrooms. The seafood was cooked PERFECTLY. The lobster was excellent--which some restaurants cannot execute. I got the fiery mix sauce with ""hot"" spice. Now, I will say that the sauce was not spicy enough for my liking. Next time, I'll get ""extra hot."" Nevertheless, the sauce was really flavorful with a lot of garlic. Yum! The potatoes are okay--I drenched them in sauce to give them flavor.   Now, the mushrooms lacked flavor. I am used to mushrooms being boiled in Cajun boil; however, that was not the case. I would suggest letting them sit in your chosen sauce.   Overall, I was very satisfied with my food. I'll update, if necessary, when I go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"If it wasn't for the seating situation I would have given this a full 5 stars. Its is a first come first serve seating setup and they don't keep a list. We didn't wait but 30 mins for a seat together but the group of 6 that was there before us was still waiting to be seated together by the time we had ordered.  That being said, that was the only fault I could find with this place.  The food was phenomenal. I am not a waffle eater but I could have eaten a dozen of theirs. I had the quartet breakfast with eggs, hash browns, sausage, and crispy bacon and then I added a waffle. It was all so good I wish I could have stayed and ate more. Our service was good in that the guy kept our drinks fill and even offered a to go one when we were leaving.  Even with the seating arrangement we never felt rushed to get up and leave.

"I bought 4 items via Door Dash: Chicken 65 ($10.00), Murg Shorba (Soup) ($5.95), Shrimp Meharaja ($21.00) and Lamb Roganjosh ($19.00).   The quality of the food was good. The shrimp were big and the lamb was tasty. Unfortunately, most of my food could have used more flavor, it was bland, so I added a few seasonings to it at home. The amount I received was was okay for the price. However I do with they would have given a few more shrimp with my meal as $21.00 is a lot for 5 or 6 shrimp.  The Murg Shorba was the best part of my order. The soup was flavorful, with just the right amount of spice. I really enjoyed it and it was filling.   The Shrimp Meharaja dish could have used more flavor but like I said previously at least the shrimp were quality. Same goes for the Chicken 65 and Lamb Roganjosh, I tasted nothing and the description on their website says it suppose to be spicy.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I'm a little torn about a rating to give Cucina Forte- some aspects of it are 5-star, and other aspects of it are 3-star, so I'll settle for a solid 4. On one hand, I love that the funky decor and lighting give the place an authentic feel. The service is very friendly as well. I've had the same waitress every time I've been here, and she does an excellent job of remembering repeat customers. She even gave my friend and I complimentary glasses of wine the last time I was here! Very sweet of her. Although the presentation isn't the prettiest, the gnocchi here is some of the best I've had in terms of melt-in-your-mouth texture. However, I think the prices are a bit steep for a neighborhood spot like Cucina Forte. The last time I was here, my friend and I split a salad, an appetizer, and 2 gnocchi entrees and ended up paying 40$ each! We searched the receipt for contributing factors to this surprisingly high price and discovered that the buffalo mozzarella appetizer we split was 15$. The quality of the cheese, olives, and sundried tomatoes on the plate didn't really live up to that price, unfortunately. Still, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a BYOB dinner spot near the Italian Market, I'd just advise them to ask about the prices for the specials before ordering.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Ate here several times during our stay at the Atlantis.The service was always exceptional. A basic coffee shop with a small menu that does what they do well.  They are of those coffee shops that does small things to make you feel appreciated. The first was the serving of individual little containers of honey and jelly to go with biscuits and tea. They also melted a container with butter in it to go on your biscuit. The waffle was crisp and delicious and the omelet I had also had a nice mouth feel of crispness.  The real star at the Atlantis is the bakery and the sticky bun we had was truly wonderful. I would have given the place five stars except the corn beef hash they served was canned.  I could have overlooked the canned hash if they had taken the time to grill it  Its a shame a place that strives to do so many little things well couldnet get this one thing right.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Service was a little slow but I am generally not in much of a hurry so I didn't mind.  We ordered the antipasto and the traditional pepperoni.  The antipasto could have had more toppings but was very good and a large portion.  The pizzas are far from a single serving.  It was pretty heavy on the cheese which my husband likes.  I just ate 2 pieces cold for my lunch.  Yummy.  I will go again, even without a deal.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The combos here come with buttered rice and a side of Chaana Masala, so filling.  My favorite dish at Twisted Indian is their Chaat Fries, fully loaded with paneer masala.

"Tried this place for the first time 4 days ago, and returned for my 2nd meal last night.  BYOB, which is always nice. The food is fresh flavorful, presentation is mindful but not overblown, and the prices are so reasonable.  (Now, I'm not commenting on the sushi and it's prices, because I just don't crave sushi, and for the timesIi do eat it, it's not in Chinese restaurants.) Anyway, they have a nice Szechuan pepper sauce in which they cook some meals, and it's spicy, but not draconian-hot; it actually delivers the taste essence of the peppers. Shrimp are large, and are nicely caramelized, not pale and limp, or overcooked and tough. Veggies look like they are fresh and were freshly cut, not laying around in some bin.  Even the brown sauce (which I usually avoid) tasted like it was mixed and cooked on the spot. It was bright and thin, not floppy and tired tasting. The wait staff are friendly. And it's a neighborhood, family/friends kind of place.  You can walk in on a Friday or Saturday evening and get a table without waiting, unlike most other places in West Chester.  Oh yeah, they have traditional Chinese, plus Szechuan, plus Thai, plus Vietnamese, and they do a nice job on all. Great value and nice friendly vibe.

"Out with a friend a few nights ago, we decided to go to North Bowl, since I utterly failed to get tickets for the Body Worlds II exhibit at the Franklin.  Yes, they're easy to get, and yes, I am an idiot, and yes, my procrastination got the better of me.    Note to self: Do not wait until the last minute to buy tickets for ANY exhibit, anywhere, at any time. It is rarely successful.   Remembering my Yelp friend Monica's review for North Bowl, I knew there were a few recommendations to remember when I got here. I think the first thing I noticed is that sadly, the vending machine did not have any of the 1950's era, three-dollar ""How to Get Along With Girls"" booklets in stock, which I really really wanted, because it sounds hilarious. Maybe I can get one from Amazon. Another thing I missed out on is ordering the award-winning Tater Tots (next time for sure)!  I'm not joking - they really have won awards - you'll see!  And the lastly, there was no way I was going to ""let her win""...because my friend Michelle is an avid bowler and is more than capable of winning without the slightest bit of my help!  (She won the second of two games).   In the end, it was a really good time. The beer selection is quite nice....not huge, but very good in what they do offer. I would also stick with the popular suggestion of going here during off-peak hours (weekdays/nights). It's not a very big bowling alley, and it's easy to see how it could be packed on a weekend night.  It's also a tad expensive, but who cares - it's not like you're going to bowl here THAT often. It's definitely something fun for a change.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I still have love for Lolita, but my feelings have waned after experiencing the restaurant on a busy Saturday night. After checking out the menu online, I was so excited to see that my salmon dish from over a year ago was still being featured. When we got to the restaurant, however, the salmon was there but the pureed hearts of palm and grilled corn salad were replaced by other sides. I opted for the short rib entree instead, while my date went with the filet.   We started off with a pitcher of margs, some guacamole and the queso fundido. There isn't much to dislike about any of these things, and they were all a great start to the meal.   Entrees came out pretty quickly after our apps were cleared. Probably a bit too quickly. The restaurant was packed, with a constant rotation of walk-ins, and I got the distinct sense that turning tables as fast as possible was the name of the game. Nonetheless, I dug into my short rib, which was tender and well-flavored, although not nearly as exciting taste-wise as the salmon dish from my previous visit.  We debated on whether or not to share a dessert or simply finish up the margaritas. I opted for the dessert not because I was dead-set on something sweet, but because I felt awkward lingering over our drinks with so many people waiting for tables by the door. Turned out, the chocolate bread pudding was a dry, crumbly disappointment (the coffee was great). After chatting with several people since Saturday night, the tiramisu has been recommended more than once.    The check came, marking the end of a somewhat lackluster night... and it was only then that we realized Lolita is a cash-only establishment.

"Recently I found myself just north of Philadelphia in Horsham. There were a few diners, and since it was around lunch, I thought I would check one out.   When I arrived at the Lancers Diner, it was packed! It's one of the few diners I've waited for seating.   Atmosphere:  The Lancer Diner is huge with a large parking lot as well. There is plenty of seating. After waiting for about 20 minutes, I sat in a nice booth by the window.   Waiting around, it felt very cramped in the diner, but once I sat down, there was plenty of space.    Coffee:  The coffee was brewed hot, and the waitress brought plenty of refills. Plus bonus, it was locally brewed Lacas coffee.   Food:  The menu at the Lancers Diner is actually on the smaller side! There is a salad bar and the regular diner options like omelets, sandwiches, and dinner options but there is nothing out of the ordinary.   There wasn't anything that spoke to me, so I ordered the smoked salmon omelet. It came with hash browns and toast. The omelet itself was good and had plenty of salmon and onions. The hash browns were fine. Was it the best diner meal ever? No, but it was good.   Service:  It took about 20 minutes to sit down, but the food came out in maybe 5. Our beverages were filled often. The waitress was friendly and funny which are both bonuses.   Overall Thoughts/Would I come back? I liked the Lancers Diner, and I would go back.

"Good evening Yelpers.  How is everyone doing out there.  Well, for those that follow me you know I do this.  YES, customer service first!!    So, because this is a new establishment you will want to go online to the website and click the online waitlist and fill in the information so that your name is already on the list and you know about what time you need to get here.  Understand that this is not a reservation but rather just putting your name on the waitlist.  Very convenient because you have an idea of around what time to get here.  The parking was not a hassle at all because there is so much available!  Now for the ""meat and potatoes "".   Because we did the waitlist we did not have to wait long before we were seated.  We got here around the time that was noted in our online confirmation.  Our confirmation indicated to arrive here around 7:52 PM we were seated shortly thereafter.  Our waitress that welcomed us and took care of us the entire time was Brittany. Let me start off by saying that her hospitality and personality was on point. She was simply amazing. From the time that we were seated she introduced us to the drink menu, made suggestions and even put in my grand daughters meal so she did not have to wait long for her food.  As a matter of fact her food was out within 15 minutes of the order being placed.  How good is that!  For dinner I had the short ribs with steak fries. The ribs fell off the bone and melted in your mouth. . Steak fries were hot and seasoned.  I also had the opopportunity to meet the Service Manager Greg Lee. Clearly his staff takes after him.  His personality was both welcoming and a breath of fresh air. I saw him make a conscious effort to stop at as many tables as he could to welcome his guess.  Customer service goes a long way. Great job Greg!  The only feedback I have is that I was charge for three drinks and there were only two for my table. I paid an extra nine dollars and I didn't have to.  Note to self, make sure that I check my receipt before signing and leaving.  Overall my experience was phenomenal.

They did leave eventually, it was still quite annoying to us.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"When Rosalita's Cantina opened in Des Peres it was on my list but then I started reading the horror story reviews and never made it there. On Wednesday I ended up meeting a friend there for an early dinner. I grew up in this area and used to eat at the Casa Gallardo in this building pretty frequently. They did a breathtaking job remodeling the space. It was fresh and modern but still felt very familiar. We started munching on the chips & salsa and looking over the menu. I really liked the thin chips others are complaining about. I thought the consistency of the salsa was just too thin but that it had a decent flavor otherwise. My dinner date chose one of the enchilada plates and a margarita. I ordered the Wednesday night special which is Bacon Wrapped Crab Cake Stuffed Shrimp (Served with bourbon creamed corn, tamale fritters, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic butter sauce.) I was pleasantly surprised when the dish was set down in front of me. I loved every single component of this dish. Great textures and flavors. The bacon was crispy and smoky, the shrimp was huge and perfectly cooked. The corn was creamy and sweet and delicious. I would eat this again and again. I'm going to have to remember that they only have this on Wednesday nights. It wasn't a particularly Mexican dish but it was a great dish with some Mexican sabor. I hope their other food is just as good and I have to say I'm compelled to return and find out.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Animo Juice is a fast, healthy, and delicious Center City option and probably my most frequented lunch place. The lines can be long, but move fast, thanks to the friendly and efficient cashiers. Food comes out at a decent pace - I think the longest I've waited is 10 minutes.  I usually order the white lightning or chocolate thunder for that delicious protein boost. (In fact, those are the only two drinks I order...I'm sure the other choices are great too but I just love the white lightning and chocolate thunder too much to change!) I've also had the tahini chickpea caesar, sometimes just as-is and sometimes with chicken. The portion size is decent and the ingredients are wonderfully fresh. The chicken and guacamole burrito is good too - a few steps above Chipotle but not outstanding.  Animo is on a loyalty app called Belly, which has decent rewards (5 points for every time you check in, free guacamole at 35 points, free drink at 75 points). Meals ring in around $11-12 for a salad and a drink, so I appreciate that all my visits go towards some freebies! Because of the app, I also ended up trying the frozen banana, which has the texture of really soft frozen yogurt and does actually hit the spot as a dessert. This place is just such a great midday pick-me-up, I always look forward to my lunches when I decide to go to Animo.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"My friend and I were looking for a sushi treat on a Sunday afternoon. My first pick was Doma, but they weren't going to be open for another 4 hours or so.  Then I found ""Crazy Sushi"" on Yelp.    We joked about the name at first because I likened it to something like ""Sushi O-Rama.""  But an average 4-star rating after 171 reviews on Yelp is nothing to sneeze at.  And now after eating there, I can say that one would be crazy not to give Crazy Sushi a try.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the lift for people who can't walk up the few stairs.  While I didn't need it, I thought that was a plus for people with disabilities.   We appeared to be the first guests to arrive after opening.  Soon after, the place began filling up with people dining in and those wanting take out.  That was a good sign.  We were addressed right away and we placed our orders, which included the spider roll, France roll and sweet potato roll.    I started with the France roll.  That roll was so delicious that all conversation stopped.  It was totally about the food and chewing the food and enjoying the flavors.  A party in my mouth to say the least.    The sweet potato roll was another amazing treat. Not as hearty or as large as the France, but it definitely held its own in the flavor department.  The spider roll was also delicious, but when compared to Doma's spider roll, Doma gets the nod because it's heartier, larger and more flavorful.  Service was par.  But in addition to our server, a woman who manned the front desk stopped by periodically to check on us and even share a couple of laughs.    The decor is very nice, especially considering the restaurant that was there before.  Crazy Sushi is a BYOB, so go and take a nice bottle of wine along with you.

Honestly I went to this place two days in a row because the first time I had it it was so good I was craving it the next day. Unfortunately I cannot get this in my home town. I will say that my dining experience was better than my takeout, but that was only because when you take it out the food steams up the container and it gets a bit moist.

"I saw this place and HAD to try it, as a grilled cheese lover myself.  Came up here on a late Sunday night. We were the only customers in there. No biggie whatsoever.  The only reason I had to give it 4 stars was because the first impressions on the customer service. I ordered the Mac 'N Rib and upgrade to a combo. Which includes a drink and tater tots. Not know there was a selection of the tots the cashier named them off. I could hardly hear her of the music but I asked what the different the selections were. You continue to turn around and just point at the menu and name the selections AGAIN, as if I knew what I was doing.  Other than the rather not great first experience the food was amazing. It's a little on the pricey side but you definitely get more than what you pay for. I definitely had enough food for lunch the next day. It was cooked perfectly and can't wait to try the other wide selection they have of sandwiches, but hopefully next time I get someone that's a little more happy to be working a Sunday night.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Most BBQ places have good meat (and this place does), so I tend to judge based on the quality of the sides.  I had the squash casserole and mac and cheese - the mac was very good, but the squash casserole was easily the best I have ever eaten (and I live in the South where squash casserole is a staple of every holiday meal).

I didn't read about the okra but after taking them out , I gulped the food down so quickly. The short rib chiang mai noodle The flavor profile wasn't as epic as the other food we had and did taste like we could've easily made it at home. The meat, however , was tender and we wish there would've been more than 4 slivers in there. Some of the noodles had clumped up and just didn't look appetizing.

"Stopped by on the way down from NorCal back to SoCal. Having lots of pho choices in SoCal had me wondering if getting pho in a fairly white demographic neighborhood was going to be a mistake. Thank goodness it was legit pho. The following are the highlights as many other reviewers have pointed out.   1. Good broth with lower sodium. Didn't feel thirsty after a big bowl of pho.  2. Very generous with quality meats.  3. Friendly and prompt service.   Some slight downsides:  1. Bowl sizes are smaller than traditional pho places but I personally think the quality made up for it.  2. Their Thai basil supplier is shaky. Apparently they can only get the good stuff during the summer.   All in all a solid bowl at a slightly higher price than I am used to, but supply and demand in the area kind of sets the price.

"I've eaten at a couple of these restaurants in the states (even bought souvenir shirts) and it was pretty exciting to hear they opened up an Edmonton location! I think the grand opening excitement has died down since there was no lineup when I went during lunchtime with my dad & my kids. They did ask that I park my stroller at the waiting lineup, although another family had brought theirs tableside. There's a fair amount of space inside and it's a whole Forrest Gump shrimp theme there which is great if you know & saw the movie, but if you're too young to know about it, the hype and nostalgic memorabilia would be lost on you...like my kids. At least it was pleasantly distracting. Washrooms are clean & match the restaurant theme, and high chairs & boosters are available too. I like how the kids menu doubles as a colouring page. I have no complaints about service, we had an attentive, friendly server despite not using the 'run/stop Forrest' signs at the table. Menu wise, my dad says ""this is better than Red Lobster"". It truly is a shrimp heavy menu which one of my kids really loves. It is a bit heavier priced than what you'd expect though. Actually I'd probably not order shrimpers heaven again because it felt like I was getting more fries in the shrimp cones than shrimp. Taste & portion wise, the serving is enough to satisfy, but there wouldn't be enough for a decent amount of leftovers. I typically order an adult meal & have the kids share it, but here... I'd say it's a better deal for each kid to order off the kids menu. They even had a mascot at the door which was a lot of fun for one of my kids and a pleasant time overall.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

We also ordered a large fry which is large enough for three or four people.    Prices are very reasonable.

I don't like to play the race card and I try to give everybody a fair chance and maybe it was a coincidence, but my friend and I were the only two in there of a certain decent, and that manager never once stopped and ask us how our food was. She stopped at the table behind us, who got food before us and ordered after us (again, no biggie because I was enjoying my drink and chips/salsa) but also stopped at the table in front of us and asked how their food was and totally skipped our table not once but twice, one has to wonder.

"It's weird that I'm giving a sports bar 4 stars since I'm seemingly pretty stingy with my ratings. I really mean 3.5 though (You would think the Yelp guys would have taken a hint and given us half star options by now).   SPBG is a typical sports bar, but a little more so. The food is better than a typical sports bar, the place isn't too big, but there is an abundance of tv's, and the crowd is neither hipster nor uncomfortably too full of regulars. I've been here twice during the World Series, and each time there was just the right amount of people there to make it an exciting game, but not an insanely overcrowded experience. Now I know that's not really controlled by the establishment, but it added to my good experience.   The grilled bbq guava wings, recommended by our waitress, are awesome. The service was very attentive and I like the siren that goes off for every good play in our favor.

"Considering that I have had these yummy tacos for two Friday night dinners in a row, I think I might be hooked on this stuff. I keep trying something new each time so that I can be sure I am not missing out on something fabulous, so far the ""Mess with Texas"" is a favorite!!  I hope to eat my way through all option by the end of the summer!!  p.s. the only reason they didn't get 5 stars (BOBBY B.) is the fresh fried chips were super greasy and stuck together so that some were crisp and some were totally soggy, the salsas, however, were great!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Truth be told, I was really going to Top Slice for a little reconnaissance mission. Many of you probably aren't aware, but Top Slice is one of the few establishments in the Bay Area that uses a product called The New York Water Maker. It's a very expensive piece of equipment that, long story short and per the company's website: ""...is the world's ONLY water source replication system that replicates any water source, enabling your business to produce superior taste and quality foods and beverages, anywhere in the world, all while filtering your water.""      Now you may be asking yourself what/why does this matter? But ohh my friend, believe you me, it makes all of the difference in the world. Ask any baker or pizza maker,and they will tell you that the water is a key ingredient in their recipes, and will affect the taste, texture and overall quality of their product (I'm starting to sound like their own personal commercial!). New York's tap water is called 'the champagne of drinking water"", and this is because It comes from three main sources outside of the city: the Delaware, Catskill, and Croton watersheds. These watersheds have limited limestone and a natural pH balance of 7.2--as close as it gets to a ""pure water"" pH balance of 7. No, I'm not a brainiac, cause I stole that last paragraph from the ""Curbed"" website, but I just wanted to show you the relevance as to why this machine is so badass.       Now that the infomercial portion of this review is over, let's get on to the food. This place truly delivers (perfect metaphor), as the pizza was delicious. Perfect amount of cheese and the sauce had a great flavor, and yes, the crust was on point. To be fair, I wish they would have gotten it a lot more crispy, as that would have definitely put it over the top, but perfection is a tough ask in the pizza game. If I lived in St. Petersburg, this would definitely be one of my go to's. They also had close to 10 other specialty pies available in the window to choose from, which I loved as this shows that they adhere to their name and also gives them that New York pizza shop feel. Throw in Calzones, Wings and other appetizers, as well as Panini's and Subs, and you can't go wrong here. See for yourself what all of the hype is about, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. If you want disappointment, just walk around the corner to the ""other"" pizza place, probably some of the worst pizza I've ever had, but I'll get to that in another review. Until then, make this place your joint. Top Slice = Top Flight.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"My go-to thai place in the Riverview area! I usually get the pad thai, pad kee mao, and panang curry. Those dishes are consistently good. I always like to try pad thai at Thai restaurants and their pad thai delivers with just the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. My protein of choice is usually shrimp or tofu. I wished they had a steamed tofu option since the fried ones can sometimes get a bit chewy. Veggies that come in these dishes are fresh! The rice noodles in the pad kee mao aren't longer noodles like I'm used to, but still tasty! The staff is fast and friendly when I go pick up my orders, but I haven't dined in yet. Restaurant ambiance is cute, open, and clean. If you're looking for Thai in the area, stop by here!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Love the food at han dynasty. Ordered the double fried fish (spicy level 4) and veg low mein - both together are enough for 3 people! The only reason I am giving 4 stars and not 5 is because they wanted to charge $4 delivery fee even though I live a block away, so I went and picked up my food instead. Also, I felt the lady taking my order over the phone was a little rude. Fortunately for them, the food is AMAZING so I will be back!!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"In part of a story that is long, and probably funnier if you were there, we (who spoke English, German, French, and Maori) were trying to order tapas in Kyoto from a waiter who spoke Japanese and Spanish. Drawing upon her long-lost college courses, my friend Sha (with incredible charades-like hand gestures to match) tried to ensure that my particular dietary needs were met. ""No le gusta el cerdo! She does not like the pig! Ella no quiere que el cerdo! She does not want the pig! Ella no come el cerdo! She does not eat the pig!""*  Long story short: I don't eat pork. Even so, I thoroughly enjoyed Cochon. The service was prompt and relaxed, and the waiter happily chatted with the chefs in the back to ensure that I got pork-less dishes. The food I had was delicious. The decor is comfortable and warm, with lot of pigs everywhere. Even with our late (9pm!) reservation the restaurant was pretty consistently buzzy, and I thought it had a nice vibe. Though this could be attributed to the several bottles of very yummy wine we brought (BYOB)...  Some other good stuff to know: I wouldn't suggest it for a romantic, intimate experience. They do offer vegetarian and gluten-free options, but you have to ask for them (they are not on the menu).   *Note, this is from Google translate, so I fully do not stand behind the accuracy or grammar of these sentences.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Truffles  Ambiance: Wine room looked to have stacked boxes and unkept.  Perhaps it was due to the holidays?  Otherwise, it was a very cozy atmosphere with very friendly staff.  They weren't overbearing and they took their time presenting their menu since we informed them that this was our first time dining at Truffles.  Eats: Out of all the dishes we ordered, the roasted bone marrow took the cake.  We already knew what to expect, since we regularly cook bone-in curries with lamb shank, so the main difference was the method of execution.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  My 7yo son loved it as well!  Only problem was there wasn't enough!!!  Escargot was the other dish that really made me love snails that much more...the fluffy pastry was a delight to experience!  I was able to distinguish each fillo dough layer.  It reminds me of fresh baked baklava.  Quite a bit of attention is required in order to have that sort of texture!  The savoriness of the escargot was on point too, although it wouldn't have hurt to have either capers or lemon to cut the rich flavor.  For what many consider the trademark dish, truffle fries, I'd like to note the emphasis on the 'truffle'...they coated the fries with truffles, almost too much.  The truffles have a great flavor, but it is easy to get overzealous on the dusting and complete overpower the reason why we like fries in the first place.  The trout topped with crab wasn't really extraordinary; the fish was slightly dry, but then again, the piece of fish wasn't that big to begin with.  As far as the crab is concerned, it was executed as if it was an afterthought.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great dish, however, I've definitely had better with the moisture content in the fish, as well as a balance on the palate.  The smoked duck was well-executed.  The cheese-bread was a bit on the heavy side though.  It would have been a respectable nod if they had steam buns and some chives to cut the savory.  That would put the dish very similar to Peking-style duck, which is an excellent dish.  I understand this is the chef's interpretation, so we leave it to the chef for modifications.  Conclusion: The ongoing theme for all of these dishes were quite savory and heavy.  I was really surprised that there wasn't a break in all of this within the menu, or even within a dish itself.  When we reviewed the desserts, there wasn't anything particularly impressive...even the dessert wines were a bit heavy.  We are definitely fans of the bone marrow and escargot!  It is a bit of a hidden gem, so there's much to be said about a place off the beaten path and still be packed!

"Can I give 3.5 stars??  No, so instead, I'm giving this 4 stars because they have new owners and they are making a great effort on this bar.  I used to be pretty regular when it was owned by Jamie.  I was really disappointed that they took away the ""bar crack,""  aka popcorn with M&Ms and other goodies.  It was a smart move on the previous owner's part because I would literally gobble up that first bowl of popcorn and drink my first beer so fast, that I had to order a second one to wash down the popcorn.    On this visit, after I was over my disappointment of the popcorn, the very friendly bartender suggested I try the truffle and parmesan cheese popcorn.  It was really good, but I thought it was a little oily for my personal tastes.  I don't have much to compare it to except Ciro's and I definitely though Ciro's was better.  The beer selection was OK, but not as robust as the previous owners.  I was OK with the Cigar City selections and ordered a Florida Cracker, but I was really hoping for some new beers to try.  I say give the new owners some time to get things in order and I will keep trying them out and update my reviews.

"There's something about Middle Eastern-style cafés that I find romantic.  Perhaps it's the comfortable cushioned benches, maybe it's the hearty, soulful cuisine, or it could be the sweet-smelling shisha smoke wafting through the air while tea is poured.  It's really all of those things, and if you want to find it in Indianapolis, look no further than Sultana Café.  Styled after a Cairene café, the interior of Sultana is lovely, although not fancy by any means.  Having been to many cafés in Cairo, I can say that despite being 6,000 miles away, it is reminicient of the real thing.  Of course, outdoor seating isn't available year-round, and the warm, dry weather of the Sahara won't be found.  With imported Egyptian furnishings and hookahs, it is an interesting, comfortable, and very fun place to hang out.  If you visit Sultana Café, don't skip out on the eats. While the menu isn't purely Egyptian, it is almost purely Middle Eastern.  With popular favorites like gyro, shawarma, falafel, and tabouli, it is hard to find something that isn't appetizing.  If you desire a dish more popular in Egypt than in the United States, try the kofta kebab. A perfect place for group dining...or a date, try ordering multiple dishes and sharing.  I have found all the meats at Sultana Café  to be wonderful.  The large appetizer platter is quite filling, and it is enough to serve multiple people with hearty appetites.    Shisha (hookah) is certainly an attractive reason to patronize Sultana Cafe. With large, Egyptian-made pipes, I found the smoking experience to be wonderful.  With myriad flavors, deciding what to smoke will be the most difficult decision of the evening.  They even have non-tobacco options available for those wishing to avoid nicotine.  I recommend the Wooden Fish blend, which is 80% Al-Fahker Double Apple and 20% orange shisha.  Be sure to enjoy your shisha with a hot glass of tea, just like you would in Cairo.  As much as I enjoy this café, I do have some constructive criticism.  First, they need to make sure their in-house menus are in line with what is published online.  There are stark differences.  Second, they would really benefit from using natural coals versus quick light coals on their hookahs. They allow for a better and more authentic smoking experience.  Sultana Cafe provides an all-around great time. Whether you want to enjoy a great Middle Eastern meal or a satisfying smoke with friends, this is the place for you.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I wish Oregano's would expand outside of Arizona.  The food isn't truly authentic and definitely not the best Italian food I've ever had.  But the food is consistently good.  The portions are HUGE!!!  Each dish could easily feed 2 big eaters.  And the price is cheap.    My husband was stationed in Arizona twice - 2002 & 2011.  Back in 2002, we were a young couple with limited funds.  Oregano's became our ""special occasion"" place.  A meal with plenty of leftovers would run us about $20.  The price thankfully hasn't increased that much since then.   In 2011, I noticed that the Zany Ziti was baked in a pie crust.  I'm not a fan of this change.  But I still like the dish.  Another favorite is the Italian gold wings.  The pizzas are also quite tasty.  And another must is the calamari.   When we were in town for work recently, we could have gone to a better restaurant.

"So, My hubby and I had to run to BJ's to get Sadie (our senior yellow lab) her bones, which they only carry there.   When pulling out, I got this craving for Olive Garden's Salad and being we were in Deptford already, I called to see if there ""wait list"" was long. To my delight, they said, ""Come right over & we'll seat you"". Yay!!  Upon pulling in the parking lot, we got a space right up front & were able to walk right in as they said & were seated immediately.   The waitress came right over to take our drink order, to which, hubby exclaimed, ""I'm ready to order dinner too!""  She did a double take as she was caught off guard (I could tell she was new), and listened to his order of Soup, Salad & Breadsticks with a Coke. She then glanced at me as I was glancing at the new paper menu which was short. I was so glad to see my favorite dish was still on there for me to order:  Shrimp Carbonara. I also ordered a raspberry lemonade.  Then 2mins later she returned to ask if I wanted soup or salad with my meal, which of course I said the salad as that's what I was there for, lol.  When she delivered our meals, a manager helped her with the trays and she did almost drop a plate on me and her face became red & you could see how upset she was that she was about to lose it...so, I'm like ""Don't worry about it, no big deal , it's fine, my son was server before too, I get it.""  Her manager looked at me like oh thank god this lady is cool and actually mouthed to me ""I'm sorry she's new"". Again I assured them it was no biggie. She was so nervous & I think I helped her rest easier.  Okay, on to the food:  Salad was really good, they just need to put more dressing in my opinion. I mixed the bowl thoroughly and there still wasn't enough for us...we love their dressing. The breadsticks were off the mark, they don't taste the same, so I didn't take more than a bite of 1.

My favorite meat selection is the spicy pork, it's flavorful and grill up really juicy.    The service can be a little disappointing at times.

"The food was better than expected, though expectations were low as this is a drive through Chinese/Japanese restaurant. Only in the South can they get away with combining the two without raising eyebrows.  If you don't feel like driving through, they have picnic tables outside where you can dine while listening to the music of passing cars.  I had General Tso's chicken. The chicken was breaded and crispy, the fried rice was a little bland for me but still good. The sauce was quite good as well. A little different than they typical Tso's, but still good. The rice had all the requisite bits (peas/carrots) but the chicken was missing green and red peppers, red chili peppers and sesame seeds. Not required ingredients I suppose but that stuff always kicks it up a notch.  The pot stickers were just as good as any I've had in a fancy restaurant. They had some hot sauce in a little container for me when I asked. It was a little different too, but good.  Service was very good. The gal was friendly and didn't like me calling them pot stickers, they are ""fried dumplings."" They had everything ready in less than 5 minutes and brought it out to the picnic table.  They also gave me a free drink refill. Total cost was $11 from the lunch menu plus pot stickers and drink.  This place will definitely make it into my regular lunch rotation.  A guy walked by taking pictures, getting me in most of his shots. We'll see if he's a fellow Yelper or just thought I was cute. Hopefully both!  Note to the owners: If the mood strikes you, why not put up a wall between the dining area and the road to drown out some of the noise? Maybe a little gurgling fountain and some Chinese / Japanese music in the background? That would really draw in walkers-by and enhance the dining experience I think. I would have come back to work saying ""They had a freaking fountain and music outside! It was awesome!"" Instead I'm sitting here Yelping.

"After walking around the Promenade my husband must've worked up and appetite so he decided to try this place. I walked in and was overwhelmed by the menu, but the young lady at the register was able to help me out and find something that I wanted. All of the food they use is natural and local which is kind of cool.  We both had a chicken sandwich that was southwestern. I opted for the sweet potato fries. Everything was fresh and I was slightly disappointed that half of the beverages in the tea/lemonade machine were so I opted for the strawberry lemonade. My husband was raving about one of the carbonated beverages he had. I believe it was orange mango. That too contained natural sugars etc.  It's a bit pricey but I'd definitely eat here again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
Stop by for lunch at Coterie Restaurant. Have to say if you want to try southern food this is the place in my book. My catfish was delicious!!

"First time here. Food was AMAZING!! Our server, Ingrid went over the menu, the specials and was very inviting. She made our meal pleasurable as she checked on us often to make sure we enjoyed everything. Would definitely come again. I have 4 out of 5 starts because the bread is not complimentary, but served as an appetizer. For the cost of the meals and everything already a la carte, bread should be complimentary.

"Good, reliable neighborhood diner. I've been here about 5 times and I've always been happy with the food and service.   The place isn't very flashy, but it's spacious and comfortable even for our group of 5. The crowd seems to be mostly local folks in the 50+ age bracket. Noise level is A-OK, some buzz here and there, but you can definitely hear people at your table speaking.   The menu is traditional, unpretentious diner fare, namely eggs, pancakes, sandwiches, burgers etc. The food is always hot, properly cooked and served quick. I usually get an omelette and they do a pretty serviceable job. No complaints.   The value here is very good. Last time we visited the check came to $25 bucks for 2 adults and 3 kids. Considering that we sometimes spend $50 or more on breakfast at other spots, I have to say that I really appreciate the affordability here.   I'd definitely recommend Mil-Lee's. Great spot for breakfast and lunch.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Fun fact: this is one of the only Korean restaurants open downtown on a Sunday.  I wanted to host a dinner on Canada Day for some friends, and picked Soy and Pepper by default because it was available and open to reservations.  Thankfully though, this little restaurant is delightful, with good food to match.  When we arrived a little after 6 pm for dinner, I felt silly for making a reservation, as we had the entire restaurant to ourselves.  It filled up later in the evening, and despite being busy, our server did a great job.    This is a little more modern than a traditional Korean restaurant, with a reasonable number of dishes to order from, but the menu is not extensive by any means. I had the bulgogi made with chicken (and also sampled the beef that my husband had) and it was great! Flavorful, good portion size and nice presentation.  I enjoyed the atmosphere, it was comfortable and trendy, and our server was super patient with my rather large group (10 people) arriving at various times throughout the evening.  Will definitely be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
I really enjoyed dinner with friends last night! Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. We had the mussels for appetizer but I finished it before even taking pictures. ( I was hungry ) Overall experience was solid 4 star quality. We sat in the patio area which was very comfortable. I came in around 9pm on a Wednesday night with no wait time. Food was delicious! Temperature and overall presentation was good. On my next visit I'd like to try a alcohol drink / or dessert. Besides the fact our server wasn't too attentive on water / ice or teas. Otherwise the experience would or could have been 5 stars. For price / quality and flavor - I am impressed. I will definitely return but not holding my breathe.

"I could hardly believe that a joint so hipster opened up literally blocks from the modest neighborhood where I lived for 15 years! Today, we had an opportunity to check it out. Great selection of beers on tap - I selected a Brooklyn Bog Mash - a hoppy beer tinged with cranberry that was refreshing. For eats, I opted for shrimp and grits - four perfectly seasoned and grilled shrimp served on creamy parmesan-infused grits. This was sooooooo good! The premises used to be one of Burlington's many fire companies, and the decor maximizes the cavernous open space with an industrial theme. A raw bar is featured on the menu. Service was friendly and prompt.  We wish them lots of success.

"Pizzeria Stella has been calling to me since it opened. I love a good pie, and my freind Quinn lives around the block. I was (an still am) thrown off by Starr's comments that good pizza isn't available in Philly. Tacconelli's has always been a special treat for me, and it's widely considered some of the best pizza in the country, not just Philadelphia. Is Starr just pimping up his new place? Or does he really believe that if it's not under his watch, it's not that good? I may never know.  For an appetizer, Quinn and I split arancini. It's a creamy, buttery, mushroom risotto rolled into a ball, lightly breaded and deep fried. The outside has the texture of hushpuppy. The contrast of the fried outside and the delicious pasta inside truly makes a great dish. I don't remember having arancini before, so I don't have anything else to compare it to, but this was a great way to start our meal.  Stella is likely the fanciest pizza you will find in Philadelphia, and truth be told, it is some of the best. My mouth is watering a bit just thinking about it.  They are small, at 12 inches in diameter. Much has been made of the pistachio pizza, and I was quite happy with our decision to split it. It is a white pizza topped with chopped pistachios, red onion, fontina, and olive oil. The combination and ratio of these toppings was great, and having nuts on a pizza tasted completely natural.  Our second pie was the Piccante: capicola (prosciutto-like spied and cured ham), provolone, crushed red pepper, and tomato sauce. The sauce is great; sweet and tangy, but still only a compliment to the other toppings. This pie was good, but the capicola was much too salty, and seemed to dominate the whole pie. Quinn disagreed with me though. The Piccante was her favorite, while I preferred the pistachio.  Sadly, the beer list here is weak. The beers are either not very good, overpriced, and in some cases, both. I'm interested in how Starr's beer garden shapes up. The rest of the menu is rounded out with twelve pies in total, and there should be one that would please any palate. Menu can be seen here. The service and atmosphere are right in line with Starr's other locations. The open kitchen where the pies are made and the prominent oven are gimmicky. But they're cool gimmicks nonetheless.  Bottom Line: Pizzas are small and expensive, but delicious. The outdoor seating here makes this a great summer or spring dinner. You'll drop around $50 for two without drinks, but it is worth it. The pies are really great, and the medley of toppings is a real treat.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"This is a nice place to get a steak if you don't want to dress up too much.  I delayed trying out Iavarone's because of its location and because I hate places that don't take reservations.  However, I am glad that I finally tried it out.  We arrived close to 9pm, so there was no wait for a table.  Our hostess and waitress were really friendly, if not especially professional.  We started with the fried calamari, and it was great.  A little on the salty side, but well fried and very tasty.  We also both ordered the Caesar salad, and it was fine, but not great.  I tried the prime rib.  It was succulent, and it was perfect with the au jus.  I wish they offered horseradish sauce too, because that would have made it perfect.  The baked potato on the side was a tiny over-salted, but still quite tasty.  My husband had the NY strip, and he thought it was great.  For dessert, I had the cannoli, which were fine but just a tiny bit hard.  I think I should have had the tiramisu instead.  I wasn't impressed by the wine list.  We decided to open the bottle we brought instead ($15 corkage), but the cocktails were pretty good.

Please note that this is one of very few restaurants in the many cities around the US where the Indian hot level of the food is actually hot!

I do feel the tacos we had would only be the same with dine in and you wouldn't get the same experience with a take out, but you never know! The meat was all tender and melted in your mouth. The flavours were punchy and the sauces excellently paired.  The staff were super friendly and made us feel good even though the space was small. Due to covid they have plastic shields up between all the tables which was a great way to keep everyone safe and still allow people to dine in and eat.  I love having chips and guacamole as a starter but it was an extra item we had to order, which is too bad I feel like they might even offer that as an included starter would have been cool. It did come with a hot sauce that was super well liked.  The snapper fish tacos were the best, they did only come with 3 tacos instead of 4 and you wouldn't know this unless someone told you. But they were super crispy and had great complimenting toppings.  We also ordered a beef, vegetarian mushroom, and pulled pork tacos which were all super tasty!

Hoo-shi is not what we want. We want sushi, and in Indy... step one: eat sushi on Friday or Saturday. The fresher the better and fresh fish starts on Fridays and goes down hill from there.

"My boyfriend drove by this place, parked the car, and said this is where he wanted to go to lunch. I quickly looked at the reviews on yelp, and was a little concerned. But, I kept my mouth shut and we went in. The exterior and interior don't match. But, my table was clean and so was the silverware, which is the most important aspect to me. So, I am a little confused why past reviewed really hammer the interior of the restaurant so much.   We were greeted by a kind older gentlemen, whom sat us and went through the specials of the day and answered a few questions about the menu.   My boyfriend ordered the ravioli with prosciutto and I ordered the vegetarian pesto pasta. The waiter double check with me if I consumed dairy products. I thought this was very nice. Most restaurant could care less if your ovo or ovo-lacto vegetarian.  Anyways, he brought out bread and butter. First, I appreciate a good carb. This bread was warm and soft. I despise when restaurants serve you bread you could break a tooth on or is not warm. Additionally, he served real butter. Oh it was heavenly. He kindly served us more bread. My stomach was happy, waist line not so much.  The waiter told us were some of the vegetable present on the dish were from. I am all for supporting local growers and I believe the produce is always better when it spends longer on the vine rather than in shipping containers. My pasta was not your typical hard box pasta. I believe it was handmade by someone. My boyfriend was thrilled by the quantity if prosciutto. I was thrilled by the amount of pesto. They aren't stingy that is for sure. The portion were a perfect size for lunch. It wasn't the heaping meal served by many chain restaurants today. I can understand this might be upsetting to some people who may come to eat here.

We got the crawfish cake (crawfish cooked within a. fried batter) and Creole jambalaya, which was rice cooked with sausage with other spice and flavors. Overall the service was fine. The seating made it a nice experience because rather than windows it was just doorways, fully open and exposed to the outside so you could be right next to the festivities happening outside.

I have been to a pizza restaurant in Chicago that is the same quick serve concept, so I was anxious to give MOD a try.   Great job, MOD Pizza! Your service was friendly, attentive, fast and most importantly you served up a tasty salad and flavorful pizza. Some folks get excited when a restaurant serves their favorite Pepsi or Coke. Here at MOD I was excited to see they make their lemonade from scratch. It was a good mix of sweet & tart, so it was a refreshing drink to enjoy with my lunch.   My pizza of choice was the, Calexico. I love jalapeños on my pizza and when I saw the Calexico had them with grilled chicken I was sold. It's a red sauce base with two cheeses; mozzarella and gorgonzola and then finished off with hot buffalo sauce. Their menu states, ""It's Hot"", but being a fan of jalapeños, I didn't find it that hot. For me it was just perfection.   In addition to my pizza, I enjoyed a Mini Caesar Salad. They warned me, (which I thought was good customer service) that their Caesar has diced tomatoes in it. I thought that was odd, but I was game to give it a try. The mix of romaine lettuce, parmesan cheese, asiago cheese, croutons and the diced tomatoes tossed in their house Caesar dressing served up a sensational salad.

This place is always buzzing and has a good crowd. Don't come here if you're  looking for a quiet night out. This is much more about having a fun vibrant night with some good Mexican food and good margaritas. I usually get the enchiladas which I have found to be the best item on the menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

As was the case when Radicchio opened in the bare northern shadow of BF Bridge, there is no scene for good food in Port Richmond.

"Wow, sometimes the most interesting journeys start in your own backyard. Pinnocchio's Restaurant was a great find going out to eat on a whim, and I'll be sure to go back and take advantage of the great food and in house beer selection.  Atmosphere - There are three areas which you can walk in. The beer garden (On the side) has hundreds of craft beers you can purchase individiually in a make your own six pack. The take out area (first door), allows you to grab some quick food on the go if you call ahead to order. We actually dined in (second door), and were treated to a standard dining area with tile floors and wooden booths. The booth felt quite cozy, but was a bit distracted by the TV's in there. A little small if you're trying to watch while dining. No matter, wasn't much on TV anyway.  Waitstaff - Our waitress was more of the 'experienced' variety. She was nice and friendly, but the food was brought out slow overall. I also tried to select three different beer choices, all of which were 'kicked' off of the draft. Was a little dissapointed in the speed of bringing things out, and had to leave to get my car from the meter before finishing our main dish.  Food - WOW, what a meal. They brought out fresh cheese bread sticks right off the bat. Flaky, like something you would get at home, but for no charge, way better then white bread. My wife had Italian wedding soup, I had to try the Buffalo Chicken Soup. Both were delicious and as advertised, had great flavor. We also ordered a round of pretzel bread sticks, which were also great. Pretzels were fresh baked, and with brown mustard and beer cheddar sauce, yum. By far the highlight was the Chicken Parm pizza. OMG, one of the top five pies I've ever had anywhere (and how can you not like pizza)... perfect flaky and crunchy crust, think tomato sauce, plenty of cheese, with more sprinkled on top. I may go back this weekend to get a pie before the football game.  Intangibles - A beer rep was there with a company giving out free samples, which was awesome. You know what was more awesome, our waitress who didn't have the beer's earlier, brought out a sample pumpkin for me to try as well. TWO FREE BEER SAMPLES, AYFKM! One downer about this place though is the parking situation... good luck is all I can say. Very small lot with next to no side street parking. Worth the walk on a crisp fall night, but when dreary weather hits, may want to go with someone who can circle the block if you're picking up an order.  Overall - I will totally head back to Pinnochio's The food was fantastic, the beer selection was amazing, and the service, well, it can only get better. Worthwhile place for any type of diner, if you're coming from out of the area though, make sure to allow for some time to find parking.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"First visit to Mercato. Although busy on a Saturday evening our waiter was attentive and helpful. We started with the arcini risotto balls as an appetizer. Served with light tomato sauce and shaved cheese, They melt in your mouth. As an entree I had veal Mercato, a mix of veal, sausage, and roasted peppers. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. The portion was perfect. not overloaded with mash and veg to make the plate seem large.  My wife had fettuccine Alfredo...she said it was the best she's ever had. I tasted and concur.

We have finally dined at this much talked about place in Tucson tonight. I was pleasantly surprised by the funky decor and the friendly service. We were starving and couldn't wait for our meal. We ordered a burger and extra fries. It did not disappoint as far as flavor went. The bun was an english muffin and I loved this concept. My only complaint was that I felt the burger was too small for the price paid. I love the idea of local food and support it 100%. I guess this is why the price is higher than expected. I do love this place and will return.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I've been a long time patron and used to go to their original location, Shinju, located on 9th and Locust. The sushi is not as good as it used to be. Many of their special sushi rolls have imitation crabmeat and I'm personally not a fan of overly sauced, fancy rolls so I usually stick with the traditional rolls. With that said, I still think it's worth coming to Fat Salmon for their lunch specials. Things on the menu I would recommend trying are the deep fried tofu appetizer (spicy), veg/shrimp tempura udon (great broth), any classic sushi rolls (spicy tuna, Alaskan, etc) and even the California roll (I would never order this anywhere else but Fat Salmon's version has avocado inside and is rolled in masago).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

They come with the classic cilantro and onion topping while the pescado had more of a ceviche topping. They were indeed delicious, especially with the beautiful salsa bar.

First time at Mr. & Mrs. Crab.   It was delicious. I've got to say I'm biased because it reminded me of eating blue crabs by the dock with my grandfather. Eating at Mr. & Mrs. Crab will bring back memories if you've ever had that type of seaside experience.   If you go thinking seafood is a healthy choice you may be disappointed. Everything is swimming in butter. It's delicious but- omg. I guess you could always order it dry with sauce on the side.   It's also messy and time consuming to eat.

"I love Cuban food, but my favorite Cuban restaurant is too far for me to make the spontaneous decision of going there. When I found a reliable Cuban restaurant near me I got excited. This front of the restaurant is hidden from the street and even though I must have driven past it many times I didn't know of its existence until I googled local Cuban restaurants. I like to order the Cuban Sandwich at least once at every restaurant for my own mental record. So, in between shifts one day, I decided to try Plato Latino's sandwich, as they also claimed it was voted number 1 in Tampa.   The Cuban Sandwich wasn't as delectable as some of the greasy, heavy options you can find in Tampa, but it has its place. The Cuban was simple, keeping the few usual ingredients you find in an authentic Cuban. It's a great option for a cheaper and less physically tolling meal. The price was fair for the size of the sandwich, if you're really hungry I would suggest getting a side with it.  Lastly, the service was quick and the employees were polite. The two employees in view from the dining area were wearing masks, but I saw a cook come from the back with no face covering at all. If you're scared of the pandemic and specifically ordering from restaurants because of it, you may not want to order from here quite yet.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Ohhhh lordy!  This is some good ole BBQ!!!  I'll admit going into SugarFire I had anxiety because the line was so long and I kept watching table, after table fill up.  Finally making it to the soda station (they have Ski BTW) I saw some openings, and started to chill.  Could have been the cold soda, but I was definitely chilled at this point.  Stepping up to the chow line I went with pulled pork.  How could I not, it had a good smoke ring, a little bark, and was glistening.  Got my sides, fries and slaw (I really wanted to put the slaw on the pork sandwich, but thought my coworkers would think I was being pretentious.    Finally I am at the table with my tray, and its time to chow.  I went with the coffee BBQ sauce.  It was good, not the best I have ever had, but good none the less.  The sandwich was outstanding, juicy, and flavorful.  I am really just so ecstatic that they have pulled pork, and not pork cubes like the local BBQ chain here in STL.  Wait a minute... what the hell is that over there.  My colleague... his sandwich...  its like a big mac, but its brisket.  What the hey?  I typically do not run an interference when someone is enjoying their own plate but I had to ask him about his sandwich.  It was thick chunks of brisket on a bun and it looked like a BBQ big mac IMO.  He loved it, I forgot the name of the sandwich, but its apparently their signature item.  All in all it was a great experience, and I am very happy that there is some good BBQ close to the office.  If you work in Westport you can definitely make it to SF's and back in an hour.  Go early, or after the rush though.  Super packed, and tight seating.  In a city with ribs named after it, you would think we would be filled with quality BBQ joints...

"This is my favorite place to come for coffee and brunch in the Tampa Bay area. The inside is very spacious and well lit, especially if sitting in the enclosed atrium section. Because the decor is mainly hard surfaces like brick, stone and glass, a full house means the noise level will be high. Service was good, even if the server was asked for an order of pancakes and brought an order of roasted tomatoes instead (I make that mistake all the time :-)). Although food is good, prices are high so you won't come here every day but nice for less frequent dining. If you just get coffee, the seating in that area is also very comfortable.

"Newman's is my favorite deli in all of  Reno. Great prices, great selection and until fairly recently unwavering quality. Something has changed, I'm not sure what except the wonderful man (owner) who was always there has not been for several months that I'm aware of. I hope nothing happened to him. But with his absence (or consecutively with) has come the slightest decrease in consistency. I would never have believed that they would  send out (to go) a salad that had brown lettuce and mushy tomatoes but they did. The best thing on the menu in my opinion is the pastrami melt...OMG fantastic. Except any more if you don't request the Dutch Crunch roll what it comes on is the equivalent of a grocery store prepackaged roll, instead of the chewy, crusty French roll in used to be on, very disappointing, but a mistake I only made once. Then there are the missing Friday  BBQ's. The only place my friends and I went to lunch on Friday's was Newman's.

They also include with this soup a chocolate covered strawberry and a roll. Very nice touch.    I got out of there for such a low price and enjoyed my soup so much !

"The location: Only Caribbean place I've tried in Nashville and it's such a small city I'm not sure if they have more to offer. It's small inside and although the building itself is old and falling apart (the door didn't close all the way to the one bathroom they have) it appears they've made an attempt to make it nice and clean. The inside seating area was small, no more than five or six tables with about five chairs each. I'm not sure what to say about the area but they did have security at the door with a gun which is both good and bad so you can be the judge when you check it out! Parking is in a gravel parking lot and is kind of weird. If it's crowded I'm not sure how you'd park without blocking someone in. It appeared they had two patio areas, one in front and back which I did not check out.  The ambience: Not the place for a romantic dinner but you probaby didn't expect that anyway. They had the TV tuned in to Saturday Night Live so the whole restaurant was just eating and watching TV together, commercials and all lol. They should get some reggae music video DVDs and loop them. The restaurant stays open well after midnight. We got there about 10:30pm to eat. After the club opened most people left the eating area to check out the DJ but we stayed in the restaurant for a couple hours just chatting and no one bothered to kick us out. You could hear the music but it was not so loud that you could not hear yourself speak.  The food: The king fish was crispy and cooked well. The curried chicken was tender and tasty. Where they lost me were the veggies. The rice and peas could have been cooked longer and the cabbage lacked flavor. The food scores a fair 3 stars.   The club: The dance floor was quite large and so was the separate bar area. It was dark inside with a couple strobe lights, a black light and plenty of seating. The DJ was pretty good playing all the dancehall tunes and there was a hype man to get the crowd going. There is no dress code. But most women who were there for the club were wearing dresses and heels.  Conclusion: If you're looking for a place to eat, shake your groove thang and pretend you're on an Island vacation, this is your best bet.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"This shop is a little off the beaten path, but it's worth it. Love the Paesano, but everything they have needs to be tried.   A low key, small place, but will say they do have some health issues, so that takes away a star. In the summer, it gets super hot and flies fly freely.  That said, it tastes delicious. Not the flies... the food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Needed to get a Po Boy on our trip to NOLA and Parkway is the place we chose out of about a list of 5 places that are known for their po boys.  The place has a bunch of seating inside and a huge covered outside area.  When you go in there are menus all over the place, grab one in case there is a line so you know what to order when you get to the person who takes your order.  And if your still not sure, everyone there is super friendly and will help you out.      I got the Surf and Turf (roast beef and fried shrimp with gravy) and my mom got the meatball.  I wanted just the fried shrimp cause that is more traditional, but was thinking ""How is just shrimp on bread gonna be that tasty, maybe gravy would help but then it would taste wrong......that is why I got the surf and turf.  It was one of those times where I didn't know what I was gonna order till it came out of my mouth to the lady taking my order.  Anyway the sandwich was great, the bread is great and like with all good sandwiches its what makes it great or only so so. Ok then while eating it, a piece of shrimp fell out, I ate it by itself, so I want to know how they make fried shrimp taste so amazing ????  And then smack me upside the head for not getting the traditional Fried Shrimp Po Boy like I wanted to !!!  My mom loved her meatball sandwich, it was packed with meatballs and it fell apart while she was eating it and she ate half of the meatballs by themselves and she said the meatballs were really really good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Pros: Nice atmosphere for a Mexican joint, clean, good for large parties and groups Cons: Service was a bit lacking (could have been an off day, I've only been once)  This place was a great stop for a quick lunch with my main man.  We were greeted promptly and got our drinks pretty quickly.  We ordered queso dip for our chips (which were warm and yummy), tacos and a burrito.  The waitress never did bring our queso, and it took a while for our drinks to be refilled.  I never got a chance to ask about the queso, because the next time the server came was to bring our food, and by then it didn't matter. Maybe someone up there doesn't want me enjoying delicious melted cheese, because this has happened to me twice in the past few months. The food was pretty decent, standard Mexican fare.  An odd observation: the solution they used to clean the tables left them very sticky.  Everything, including chairs, was sticky. Also, the stone floor in part of the restaurant was very slick and someone could easily slip.  I had to be really careful when I walked on in so I wouldn't fall!    All in all: Yummy and good for big groups or quick lunches!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"SO MUCH FOOD!  Came here for the first time almost a month ago and was not disappointed. We ordered the Fried Pickles to start and HOLY CRAP -- I think they might be the best ones I've ever had. The ""Feed sauce"" they come with was the perfect compliment.  I ordered the Dirty Bird for my meal and I swear they put half a chicken on that sandwich. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the gravy was just a bit too spicy for me. My boyfriend ordered the H.W.B. burger and I got to take a bite and it was DELICIOUS. Whenever we come here again, I'll probably get that.  I'd love to try brunch here at some point, but I know we'll be back for dinner again.

"The first time we tried Green Eggs, we took the risk of showing up for brunch on a gorgeous Saturday at 11am with a party of 7.  Not surprisingly, the restaurant was packed and we doubted their ability to seat and serve us in a reasonable amount of time. However, the manager went out of his way to ensure that we were taken care of and, at our request, a large table was set up for us outside within 15 minutes of our arrival.   Our server was excellent and the food was even better. Their menu is chock-full of unique and delicious dishes. Everyone at our table was able to order something different and be 100% satisfied (and stuffed!) They are BYOB, so bring a bottle of bubbly and they'll hook you up with a carafe of fresh OJ.

"First time tonight with my mom and two kids. Decor was clean, fresh, & homey. Bathroom was clean. Friendly servers. Very quiet for 6pm on Friday night. Waitress was new and needed more training- needed to check if they served sangria. Servers (even the ones not assigned to our table) were very attentive and stopped by to chat and bring more drinks. Kids split the seafood risotto (pic is after they had already dug in!). Very tasty and lots of rice, but lacked enough seafood for $24. There were maybe 3 shrimp, 4 mussels, 2 clams, and 4 tiny pieces of calamari. My 6yo even asked if she could have more calamari because there wasn't enough!  To my (pleasant) surprise, they brought her 5-6 small pieces at no extra charge.  I ordered the filet mignon with extra vegetables instead of potatoes. It was cooked nicely, but way too much sauce. and actually looked like the good-sized filet was sitting in a bowl of soup! Sautéed zucchini, spinach and raisins was delicious but not a large enough portion, especially since I did not order potatoes. Hope they work out the kinks and pricing--it's close to home and would be a nice place to frequent more often.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Went to dinner for my wife's birthday and happened upon Anton's. This was a great find. Classic bar in the Swan hotel served an equally classic Manhattan while we waited for our table. We started with an excellent grilled asparagus risotto followed by a pear and gorgonzola salad.  This was one of the best salads I've had in while.  I had the petite filet (with more gorgonzola) for my entree and my wife ordered a vegetable plate.  Both presentation and flavor showed that the chef truly cared about his product. We finished with the chipotle chocolate cake, absolutely incredible...definitely a winner.   I would have given it 5 stars but the only downside was our server who really lacked personality.  It appeared she was uncomfortable with all our interactions and struggled giving recommendations on food or wine.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"RICH MAHOGANY woods, candlelit dark leather seating, the aroma of grilled steak... FLEXIBLE MENU keeps it affordable: discounted prix fixes, happy hour small plates; LOYALTY: Dickie's stayed in NOLA after Katrina; Ruth's Chris abandoned the city.  I lived and worked inside the Chicago loop almost 5 years in the 1990s. I chose Chicago because like New Orleans it's a city of neighborhoods, loyalties and quirky corny traditions. Similarly, it's also a city that loves its infamous history, particularly the roaring twenties. For me nothing more exemplifies that era than Chicago's dark, clubby steakhouses. Restaurants that still serve the same century-old menu of au gratin potatoes, wedge salads, and gin not vodka martinis. Dickie Brennan's first opened in the French Quarter about the time I returned home. And, more than any other in the city, it reminds me most of what a ""big shouldered"" steakhouse should be: the highest quality beef, straight forward cocktails and a hearty reinterpretation of that burly age.    COOLINARY GOLD STAR: by far one of the best values for an amazing meal: shrimp and smoked peach mesclun salad, perfectly panéed veal with grilled asparagus, and a weighty bananas foster bread pudding: $35 - now there's a restaurateur that knows how to treat his locals!

"This a newer location, and it is kept cleaner than most Taco Bells.  The food is what you'd expect from a Taco Bell, and the staff is noticeably more polite than the average fast food establishment.  My only complaint is that for whatever reason, this location consistently forgets to put the cinnamon twists in the bag if you go though the drive thru.  I've been through literally dozens of times and have ordered cinnamon twists, and almost 100% of the time they do not end up in the bag and I have disappointed kids when I get home.  It is not just one (1) particular employee:  No matter who is working the drive thru, it is almost a sure bet that the cinnamon twists will remain on the shelf and not make it to the bag.  Be sure to check before you drive off!  I am baffled as to why this is such an issue at this particular location, while all other Taco Bells can seem to handle this.  Other than this one (1) gripe, I would recommend this location to others.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Went for dinner on the 2nd night they were open. The colorful and fun decor was a nice change of pace to many of the Mexican restaurants in the area.  Like any new restaurant, they are working out the bugs and figuring how to work together, but I'd say they're off to a great start.  I asked about a few items on the menu and found out that there are many errors on the menu per the manager, they should have that straightened out pretty soon. The orders did not come out from the kitchen as listed on the menu, but what we all received was delicious and flavorful. The salsa they brought out with the chips had OK flavor, but really didn't have any spice kick at all.  If you like a little spice, make sure to ask for the salsa picante, which had great flavor and was definitely spicy.

"Cute little pastry spot near my hotel with a stay in the French quarters. Main reason we stopped by in the morning was for macarons. I was a bit disappointed with the selections of macarons they had and you couldn't just get the flavours or specific amount you wanted because it was bagged together randomly (decided it was better to just walk to nearby sucre and be able to have the freedom to choose flavours and how many to buy).  I ended up opted for the quiche and fruit tart. The quiche was filling, and the fruit tart was delicious. A bit more pricey than I expected for the pastry but I guess it due to being in a touristy location.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Service was not bad at all but we ordered the peanut butter chocolate chip cheesecake and it arrived with no peanut butter or choco chips, she still charged us  for it.  Just ok.  Fish tacos were bland and boring with what tasted like jarred salsa.  Not impressed.  Likely won't return.  The crab sandwich was pretty good though.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"A lot of mixed feelings about this place. Let me start by saying though, the vibe and decor of the restaurant is great. Love the style and open layout concept.  Looking at the menu, everything sounded amazing. Photos made the food look incredible and the reviews were great. I had high expectations after researching a little bit.  The angel biscuits were INCREDIBLE. The best thing on the menu. Something about dipping it in all the ingredients that pair perfectly together in your mouth is something else. It truly was delicious.  For our entrees, two of us got the braised short rib meatloaf and my sister got the chicken under a brick. We ordered mac and cheese for the table. The short rib was pretty good in my opinion, especially paired with the mashed potatoes and broccolini. I would order that again. My other sister said hers was a bit dry and didn't like it as much as I did.  Where they went wrong is the chicken under a brick and mac and cheese. I was confused when I tried these because everything else had been pretty good up to this point. The chicken under a brick was not great and I don't recommend getting it. There was a lack of flavor and the ingredients together just didn't do it for us. My sister didn't eat more than a couple bites. The mac and cheese also lacked a lot of flavor and tasted pretty bland.  The only term I can think of for describing the food is inconsistent. Some things are incredible and others fell flat. However, I won't let that detour me from coming to try other things. I just won't be trying those two things again. Another point to add is it is a bit overpriced.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

After lunch I went to their market next door. Since they have been in the sausage business for over 100 years I figured that must be good. Bought sausage scalloping and had it for dinner - horrible!

It's passable for the pricing but this place is actually kinda bad. I wasn't a fan.

"Based solely on the delivery service as I've not eaten at the restaurant, I'm really puzzled by the accolades this place has received. We found the food to be greasy and the flavours to be very average American Chinese flavours (eg bland and lacking umami). Perhaps our standards are too high based on food we've had in NYC, SF and the LA area, or in London? I think Chinese American restaurants tend to play to their audience and perhaps the cooking here suits the local palate.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
Probably the best restaurant in the French quarters I've tried. Not typical southern dining food. Very commercialized. Prices were over priced & portion sizes are small. The charbroiled oyster had huge shells but oysters were small. Flavor was hood. Lobster Mac & cheese was tasty but 15.00 for about 8 ounces. If you want lobster it's better to get it a l carte. The surf & turf combo isn't worth it. Over all I would go back for the drinks & Cesar salad. It was a nice portion side & price was right for a side salad.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I feel bad for the people who went here and thought this was Mexican food. My four year old would know how to season food better than the cook here.  FYI, my family and I eat out at Mexican restaurants at least every other week and just moved to Clearwater. I also worked in a Mexican restaurant in my twenties and know how Mexican Food is supposed to taste.  To start off, you seat yourself and wait 15 minutes before someone comes to take a drink order. We had to grab menus off other tables as well. The server was friendly once he came to the table. It took forever to get our food. I had fajita nachos. It tasted as if they soaked the chicken in McCormicks montreal seasoning. ( I use that to grill and am very familiar with it). My husband got a burrito, enchilada, taco combo. No rice or beans came with it...never had a combo meal without rice and beans! Meat had no flavor or consistency...like they ground up the beef and put it straight in the burrito!Kids had nachos which wasn't bad except the guacamole was a light green color and so drippy it did not stick to the chips when you dipped it. Cheese dip was awesome, that is probably the only reason we gave it one star, well besides the fact we had to.   We went to pay at the front. Stood there for 10 minutes while employees kept walking by. Finally a girl came in the front door and let us pay. I am really hoping we all do not get sick tonight.

"Typical Mexican chain restaurant.  Pros:   *Familar Americanized Mexican food for larger parties/ families.   *Good drinks (pitchers of margarita)  *Chips and salsa come out quick   *Food comes out quick  Cons:   *Long wait times, especially on Friday *Tables are left unbussed while customers wait *Waiters often miss details of order, miss refills  And for the BIG one, for me at least.  This is dumbed down bland food for the American palate.  I can't hate on them for cooking what 95% of their customers want in this area.  The spices and flavor is lacking seriously.  If you are a foody... avoid....you will be disappointed.  I have spent a good part of my life around Mexicans in CA (OC,LA) and have taken a true appreciation of the complex flavor and history that Mexican people (absolutely awesome, inspiring btw), and their mind blowing food brings to the world.   That being said, this ain't it.  If you are just slamming down calories or drinks, go for it!  If you want taqueria style food in this area, go to Pedro's around the corner.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I did not want to leave a bad review. I'm a huge fan of La Fia and eat there multiple times a month. When I found out that Lolo was owned by the same group, I immediately wanted to give Lolo a try.  My first experience was ordering take out. When I called the order in, I was informed that the menu online was out of date. Annoying, but moderately understandable. I ended up getting something that the host offered. When I received my order I wasn't overly satisfied but attributed that to the fact that it was take out. The food was decent but was lacking.  I decided to dine in a few weeks later and give them another try.  The restaurant was busy and the atmosphere was high. My date and I were excited. We sat down and I got a beer and she a glass of wine. The wine was very good. After several minutes of trying to understand the menu we ordered the drumsticks and croquettes. The waiter continued to take our menus and put our order in. When the food came out we were very taken back at the presentation, quantity, and appeal of the croquettes. They literally looked like 3 TINY, soggy mozzarella sticks. The plate was ungarnished and lacked any visual appeal. Needles to say, we expected a lot more for $12 ($4 per croquette).  I could understand the cost, if there was some depth to these, but they were so underwhelming in taste. The absurdity of the situation completely ruined our night. We feel totally ripped off.  I understand also that it was a small plate, but after ordering only two small plates, the waiter could have alerted us of our decision.  2 strikes and I'm out. I wish I could have talked to a manager, but I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.   I think this restaurant  has potential but needs to reevaluate their menu (again). This dish is an embarrassment in its current state.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"This opened on Silverada recently, inside the old Wendy's. Service was fast, and the employees are very friendly. They need to move the menu closer to the order counter & fix the lighting on part of it so us blind folk can read it without squinting. :)  Loved all the sauces, brisket was nice (tad bit dry), pork links were very good. The sweet potato fries are also good, but need dipping sauce of some sort.  Coleslaw without carrots is a mortal sin punishable by...something (I'll think of it later)  Decor was ok, but the ""about us"" plaque & other reading material needs to be moved away from the drink station to keep the flow moving. Can't get a drink when people are staring at the wall over the drink station. Seems to be a local family operation, always a win in my book.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I am a huge fan of this place because of the food, service, and variety. I continue to frequent here and it's my top casual steakhouse choice.   First of all, service: one of the waiters, Davide, was EXCELLENT. We ate at Outback over a month ago and I still remember his name! He knew the menu like the back of his hand, including the names of items that they don't longer serve. And when we asked for Sydney's Sinful Sundae, he told us it wasn't a problem for them to make. But he wasn't the only example--the waiters/waitresses here are overall awesome and try to make your experience as pleasant as possible. I asked one waitress for a warm alcoholic drink one night and she was really quick to think--amaretto and hot chocolate is now my favorite winter beverage!   Next is the food and variety. I love the surf and turf options that they have, first off. Every time I order the prime rib and lobster, it's made to perfection. Also, the steaks--I don't like my steaks (really, food in general) seasoned a lot but my boyfriend does, so for us having the choice makes us both want to come here. I also love their soups and sides. The one side I wish they have is corn, but hey, no one is perfect. AND THEY NEED TO BRING BACK SYDNEY'S SINFUL SUNDAE!!!!!  The prices are definitely affordable and we try to go here once every two weeks.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Most of the food was quite tasty, as was my skirt steak.

Also, I had to ask for a glass of water three times.  Each time they told me they would bring one but didn't.  Otherwise, the service was polite and timely.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Hit & Miss ... I have had excellent experiences in the past but lately, just so so. I have had the Carpaccio numerous times, always delish, as well as many of the homemade Pastas throughout the years. I especially enjoyed the Squid Ink pasta with Scungilli & I am not normally a fan of that of that little snail. However, the last time I ordered the Lobster Ravioli, it included a few small shells in the filling & it was a little too al dente. I.e. Cold & Hard,  Much like the way the owner speaks to & treats his wait staff in front of his Clientele - also the way the Blonde Hostess treated my little Daughter & I upon our arrival for our reservation. Not even a Good Evening - Merry Christmas -  Thank you for joining us - Niente. Very much unlike any family owned Italian Restaurants that I've seen. You should, in my humble opinion, receive a warm greeting. Especially on a Holiday. It's been 4 months since our last visit & I am unsure if I will return. I am a Seasoned Italian Cook that comes from a long line of Restaurateurs so as you can safely assume, it is a rarity for us to even eat out at an Italian restaurant. Everyone in our family prefers "" Mom's Kitchen"" over some mediocre place. Casa was our go to if we were in the mood for some delicious homemade pasta without the mess or for a special occasion.

The lobster to my surprise was one whole 3lb lobster, the biggest lobster I've ever seen! Their take on the lobster roll was delicious and extremely flavorful. We loved the fried chicken as well but of course the lobster dishes were the highlights of our meal.   Although the food was fantastic, there were some minor discrepancies with our overall experience. We waited about 15-20 minutes for our table despite having reservations. On the way to our table, our hostess realized it wasn't ready and walked us back to the hostess stand only to take us back to the same table a minute later. I ordered a grilled lobster but received a steamed lobster instead.

"We visited Grillsmith on a moderately slow Friday night recently. In an area surrounded by chain restaurants, Grillsmith has managed to make a name for themselves by offering ""Superior ingredients, made from scratch execution and extraordinary hospitality"".  We were immediately seated upon arrival and were given menus to look over while we waited for our server to arrive and take our drink order. Maybe we were forgotten, maybe she was busy doing something else, but by the time our waitress showed up we already knew what we were going to order.  We ended up ordering a table full of burgers, then had a good chuckle when or server brought out a basket of bread sticks. Nothing like some carbs before your carbs!  I ordered the classic cheeseburger, topped with Swiss cheese and mushrooms. For my side I opted for the PBR Jalapeno Mac and Cheese instead of the standard French Fries. I was rather surprised when the food came because the beef patties were obviously thawed from frozen, and the buns looked like they came from Costco. The mushrooms were sparcely scattered atop my burger and the meat was cooked medium as I had ordered, but it was completely bland and void of any flavor. I was mostly excited for the PBR Jalapeno Mac and Cheese. It was nice and cheesy, but ultimately, I could not detect any Jalapeno...or PBR.   All of the burgers were cooked similar and the only differences to our order were the sides. My girlfriend ordered the Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes and my daughter the fries. The potatoes were decidedly made from Instant and the fries originated from a bag and tasted eeriely similar to MacDonald's.  With so many options in the area, I doubt that we will return any time soon. We already have a Costco by the house.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"No doubt this place is seedy and definitely does attract all the colorful characters you read about in the reviews.  This is not a classy joint, but it also isn't trying to be.  Some of the reviews I read below are just ridiculous.  It's like they're complaining that they don't serve filet mignon and McDonalds!  Ok, now that I've got my rant out of the way, I'll tell you why I DO like about The Neva:.  FRIENDLY staff.  If you sit at the bar and put a little money in, you're getting comped drinks.  Period.  No attitude, no glancing at how much you're wagering.  Nothing.  Just your drink and a smile.  This place puts itself out there as a ""regular Joe's"" casino and they definitely walk the walk on that front.  Good low end poker.  You wanna play $10 texas holdem tourneys three times a day?  You got it.  They also try to spread a $1/2 no limit game, but that doesn't always get going.  Fun place to learn for newer players or to blow of some steam after a bad run in the bigger games for you more experienced hands.  If you're not into gambling, drinks are super super cheap here anyway (a big group next to use ordered 10 beers, a double cocktail and a glass of wine and their bill was $18!  They've also got beer pong upstairs.    Hotel is definitely not so nice, but if you live outside town and have a few too many, it's a decent option.  The rooms are clean but definitely run down, and dated.  Comfy bed at least.  Furthermore, our room was comped basically just cuz we asked a manager.  So.... that was pretty sweet.  Lots of different cheap activities and a serious slice of life for downtown Reno... as long as you know what you're in for, you'll have a great time.

"Han Dynasty is a different experience than your typical Chinese food restaurant. Most of their dishes have a 1-10 rating in hotness. They also have a selection of meat/, fish or veggie, but depending on the dish, the selection can be just one, or about five different options. It reminded me of a Mongolian grill, but your sitting down, not watching, there are more options, and it's not Mongolian.  The prices are a little high, considering how inexpensive good Chinese food can be. And, for someone not familiar, it's not so easy to know what many of these dishes taste like.  I ordered the 3 chicken. It was good, though the chicken was about as soft as chicken can be, almost doughy. And, it was not breaded! Weird, I know. Anyway, it tasted good, but lacked any veggies. A friend pointed out that since the set-up is family style, that it might work better if mixed with a veggie dish.  The hottest dish anyone got was a 5, and I am told that was pretty spicy. I can only imagine what a 10 is like. And no, I did not try the 5 dish. I'm just not balling like that.  We had dumplings and scallion pancakes as apps. They were both good.

Portion size is decent and it's the one restaurant where I think they use less msg than most; I don't feel sick or gross after eating their food. I got the sweet and sour pork dish which was in my standards, subpar. I would have preferred if they brought out the pork and sauce separately so that the pork doesn't get soggy. The breading was also a little bit too much that day.   So... The food is excellent but the reason for my 3 star is because of the service. I had to wait a decent amount of time before the waitress came to check in on us. I wouldn't have mind the wait if there a lot of people but... The place wasn't as busy yet, service was slow relative to the work load. Could have been a bad day since I've been there before any it wasn't too big of an issue but it was service was.. subpar that day.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"My girlfriend and I just got the Chicken Italiano and it was really good. Smells delicious, roasted red peppers cooked perfectly, we both like garlic and thought it had the perfect amount. Before putting it away I stole another slice and it tasted even better than when it was hot! I have gotten cheesesteaks there and they were equally good. Definitely suggest it. Prices are reasonable I think and service was great.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Rating based on Take Out orders 2 Times in past 3 weeks.    I so want to love this place.  Being a proud Ohioan, I was glad to see a Cleveland based place come to my area.  Knowing how good ""bar"" type food can be in Ohio I couldn't wait to give it a try.    What I really liked:   1) Wing Sauce variety.  Great selection of differing sauces, not your mild, medium, hot, super hot shtick.   2) To-go containers were the better quality plastic clam shell type and not the cheap foam which always seems to melt on top or get sauces flowing over the sides.   3) Wings are fresh, never frozen   What I didn't think was so great:   1) thin crust pizza - crust was mushy and flimsy - ordered pizza with pepperoni, sausage & onion and I found maybe 2 onion slices.   2) wings were smaller than most wings you would buy in this area   3) the to-go containers weren't marked as to which wing sauce was inside and we ordered like 4 types each time, so I really cant tell you which sauces I like or dont like.   I will go back as I want to try some sandwiches and get a feel for what the place is like on the inside when dining in.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I came in here with a friend for breakfast after reading some reviews, we both ordered the apple pancake in Medium, I make something very similar at home and I have eaten something like it at another restaurant.  We also ordered coffee.   My son order a breakfast that had hash browns, biscuits and gravy, eggs and I think sausage.  He can do his own review, I just know he said the hash browns were not done.  Both of our Pancakes were overcooked in my opinion, the apple and cinnamon was very tasty and hot, but the pancake itself was dry and even over cooked cake like.  So a dry cake if you will.  It was still good, and maybe they had an off day.  I know they said it would be 35 minutes to make which might explain it as I wouldn't think it should be baked for that long, but hey I am not a chef, just someone who cooks and bakes a lot.  The coffee was well coffee, it wasn't the best I have ever had, but not everyone likes the same style coffee, even if my friend and my son agreed it wasn't the best.  Will I be back, in one word yes.  I want to give them another chance as I really wanted to enjoy the meal.  I will try one of their omelets or something else next trip, but I will be back.  When I do I promise to update this review.  I would have gone 3.5 stars by the way.  As I know how hard it can be to bake a pancake like this.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"3.5 stars  Yay!  The boss let us out early for the Fourth of July festivities.  That meant I could actually get into a happy hour after a commute from Philly to meet up with a friend.  Our first choice was randomly shut down for vacation, so we headed here.  Coming in from Haddon Ave, I automatically pulled into the driveway right by the big sign.  I didn't see the smaller sign that says DO NOT ENTER.  Luckily, I didn't hit any cars.  Sowwy.    I got there a little before 4:30, and was seated immediately, but unfortunately, that was apparently the same time the manager was having a meeting for all the server staff starting the dinner shift. After no one came by after about 15 minutes from when we were first seated, I finally got up to ask the hostess if someone could take a drink order. She said she couldn't help me.  Decided to OMMM myself and sat down to wait, and finally, the staff meeting broke up and our extremely extremely extremely perky server stopped by.  I ordered the mussels which came with 2 small pieces of bread. I would've loved more bread to dip into the tasty juices of the dishes.  My friend chose a vegetarian pizza, which was decent.  It wasn't too too busy, so we were able to sit comfortably in a booth and enjoy a catch up conversation. Overall, pleasant enough.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Gallagher's is definitely a, ""Winner, Winner - Chicken Dinner"". I've heard great things about Gallagher's for years, so for the celebration of my friends 29th Anniversary of their 29th birthday, we decided to do a road trip to Waterloo. It took us only a half hour from downtown STL and it is so worth the drive. It was less time then driving out to west county.  Sunday is Family Style Chicken Dinner for $12.95. Family Style is the polite way of saying, ""It is all you can eat"". Our table was covered with a platter of crispy & juicy fried chicken, a bowl of fresh green beans with ham, another bowl of corn custard and yet another bowl of mashed potatoes and finally a gravy boat of milk gravy. Then when you are done stuffing yourself with all these home cooked delights, they offer you a piece of Susie's Sheet Cake for dessert. The flavor changes on the regular, so our flavor was Blueberry Lemon.  Fried Chicken: Large pieces, crispy crust & juicy inside, not spicy or overly salty - just perfectly seasoned.   Green Beans: Simply seasoned with ham, salt and pepper  Corn Custard: Unique in its' own way - everyone loved it once they tried it.   Mashed Potatoes - Whipped heavenly, with a very lumps to show it truly is homemade.   Milk Gravy - Life doesn't get any better then gravy made from fried chicken drippings.   Sheet cake: The sweetness and tartness of blueberries and lemon made a great finale.   The whiskey and craft beer menus will blow you away. You'll never expect the variety they offer from a small town restaurant. The birthday honoree loved their Whiskey Sour and my Manhattan had good flavor, but a tad too much vermouth for me.   The service was your typical down home, small town friendly with a twist. Some of the staff was clean as a whistle, boy/girl next door type and others were hipster/lumbersexual. Making for a nice mix of service with a smile.   I loved the fried chicken dinner and cannot wait to go back and try their ribeye.

"Three stars is generous based on my experience this week.  The cafeteria style line was long and nobody there to push chatters and the indecisive along.  Part of the problem is you don't get to see the hot choices until you are through with desserts, salads, beverages and cold items.  (The other part of the problem is stupid people with children plus strollers unregulated by their parents.)  For about $9, I got a side salad, a veggie wrap, a lingonberry juice box and a water.  Prices were reasonable.  Had I passed ""hot"" first I would've gotten a hot meal.  All the food looks appetizing.  The registrar was listless, rang the goods but acted like telling me where dressing was kept was a chore.  Finding a fork was in one place, finding a napkin was 30 feet away from that--a little ridiculous, especially for the walking challenged.  The food was tasty--the spring mix could've been cut into bite sized pieces since a fork doesn't cut well in a styro cup.  The wrap was flavorful but needed dressing as you got deeper into it.  My friend loved her veggies, thought her mashed taters were dry, loved the pear beverage. Our choices were not very ""Swedish"".  Tables were not being kept clean by patrons, nor trays put away when finished.  It's unfortunate that patrons are not self-responsible for their own clean-up, but the restaurant should be accountable for someone on the floor to train them, to clean up after them, to add a fee to those who don't (yeah, I said it) and restore clean places to eat for others.  I would not go out of my way to eat here, but in a hunger pinch, the food is fine.  Some sort of menu would be helpful-relying on wall photos while in a pushy long hog trough like at Disney is not my style.  Having to wait for all the hot food people when you grab a cold item and are stuck in line behind them is beyond frustrating.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"September 1, 2012  Doesn't like it good, not great Rib Eye Steak and Chicken Egg Roll - In doing a carry out tonight, I took recommendations off the menu from the bartender. While the house salad was good and portions were ample here, the main entree--a rib eye steak he said was his favorite @ $27...while cooked correctly, was just ok...he raved about the 3 day marination but it didn't come with any kind of sauce and I had to add salt...disappointing for that kind of money. The smashed potatoes again were ample and good, the Southwestern eggroll was not. The fried dough was tough...like it had been deep fried hours ago and microwaved for service---BAD, Very BAD....I would have expected a little soggy...being in a carry out container for 20 minutes, but not tough. I wouldn't rush back there....For the $60 charge (lucky I had a $30 coupon), it was not worth it.

"Warm atmosphere, the bar is essentially in the restaurant. One big open space. Not the best for a quiet intimate meal. I sat at the bar, it took a bit to get acknowledged but finally did by a manager. The bar was busy but the bartenders attention was consumed by a large family table. A server should have taken this table so his bar guest didn't get neglected in my opinion. Once that table left the bartender was exceptional! Excellent service! He knew the menu, made suggestions and i was very pleased with the wine he paired.  So on to the food, taking the bartenders suggestion we ordered the Pepper-jack Cheese-sticks for our app, Delicious!! Light crispy flavorful breading and the cheese was scrumptious! The srirancha sauce was good but i prefer marinara.  One to the entree - Rotisserie Combo - Checken, Tri-tip, Ribs and 2 sides. Macaroni & Cheese and Sweet Corn Salad. The meat was all delicious but over salted (and I like salt). The mac & Cheese (like 1/4 C) portion) very bland. Could have used some salt. Lol! The Sweet Corn ""Salad"" again only like 1/4 C, was good, cold and probably would have liked it more if it were summer time.  Oh and you get a choice of 2 sauces for your meat. We went with Spicy Aji Panca & Chimichurri. DONT GET IT! Yuck! The Panca was very salty chili sauce and the Chimichurri had a fish taste to it...WTH? The meat was plenty seasoned enough, again too salty though. These sauces are not needed at all.

The pulled pork consisted of chunks of fat and gristle to the point that I had to pick through it to get to the meat.  The fried green tomatoes had a really greasy breading that just fell off, and they were served on top of a curvy stripe of mayonnaise.  Everything seemed to be incredibly greasy.

"We had no issues with food quality. It was the reason we chose to visit this restaurant again. Service was absolutely terrible. We had to repeatedly ask for chopsticks/silverware and a napkin after we got our food. No one explained what each roll we ordered was, they just dropped off a big plate of sushi and walked away. We ordered drinks which were never brought to our table. Additionally, in the middle of our meal someone started to clean up and remove items from our table as we ate. There was an hour before close of business! They made us feel like they were rushing us out the door. No one ever checked to see if we needed our drinks refilled or anything! We used to eat here on a weekly basis before moving. While in town we decided to return. I have not experienced this  low level of service in a very long time, possibly ever.

"I've been coming to Manila Cafe ever since it opened years ago and when it was in the shop next door in the plaza, but just haven't found time to review the place until now.  All I'll say, is that Manila Cafe is the best Filipino food that you will find for purchase in the area with the next true competitor being Reyta's over in Cherry Hill/Voorhees.  When it comes to value, Manila Cafe is where it's at, because not only do they serve quality Filipino food that gets all the Filipinos to flock to Mt. Laurel, but they do not skimp when it comes to portions. Service is always prompt and of course filled with Filipino hospitality.  During this pickup I ordered a tray of lumpia and man was this the best lumpia I have ever tasted. Maybe it was because it was fresh from the kitchen, but this lumpia gave me the loudest crunch and softest filling I've ever had. To be honest, lumpia was never up there as one of my favorite Filipino dishes, but one bite of their straight-out-of-the-kitchen lumpia and it'd convince anyone.

"I really wanted to love this place, but I unfortunately can't say that I did. The staff is great and the inside is comfortable and spacious and well lit, but the prices are extremely high for the quantity of food you get. It's pretty good food (albeit a bit salty) don't get me wrong, but other restaurants give you more for the same amount or cheaper.   We ended up ordering the chicken tikka, shrimp vindaloo, and garlic naan. The naan was HUGE which was awesome, but the chicken tikka and shrimp dish were both really small. There were probably eight pieces of shrimp in the vindaloo, which for $18 dollars is exorbitant. Another, maybe small, gripe I had was that I asked for a bit of yogurt since the food was quite spicy (I ordered it that way, and it was great but I just wanted something to cut the spice a bit) and our waiter brought out a pot of it (I finished maybe a quarter or fifth of it), not telling me that he was charging for it or how much he was charging for it. It ended up being three dollars, which definitely isn't a huge amount of money, but I just wish that he would have told me. (I figured he'd just bring out a chutney sized bit of it and wouldn't charge.)

Not worth the parking hassle. On a positive, sexy atmosphere, good service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I was cordially invited back, to my surprise, to Culinary Dropout! So I was super excited to return and give it a second go!  Again the interior was clean and interesting, and the entire staff just blows me away with their warmth and welcoming courtesy.  We were situated quickly, and I ordered the black tea. Come to find out it had a hint of Passion so I'd recommend it! Crisp, cold, and fresh like last time, so thank you for that! I take my tea seriously.  The food came out in a flash!   We sampled the pork belly nachos, and pretzel bites (which were huge). The cheese fondue came with a tea light warmer. All the appitizers blew my socks off. I'd, again, recommend the balsamic grilled bread.  I reoreded the fish, I couldn't resist. It came out a deep golden brown! The coleslaw was fresh, and the fries were fantastic. Thank you for leaving the skin on! Everything was balanced off with some good ole malt vinegar. The beer batter was on point.  My husband ordered the M.A.C burger, and dug right in. And I heard nothing but compliments from his end.   I was blown away with my dinner today. I got to talk with the manager about my favorite thing as well, food! I got excited about the menu and have pretty much left my prior experience to an off night.  I'm happy to say I'll be coming back to Culinary Dropout again soon! I highly recommend them.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Ya'll know I love some smashburger, right? I came here with two friends for a quick birthday pre-celebration meet up and noticed a new item on the menu: The brisket burger; my lucky day! I only order one patty because stomach can't handle a double burger anymore, plus I needed to save room for the milkshake!  The burger came out pretty fast and looked darn good. The brisket wasn't overcooked and there was a hefty amount on the burger which is always cooked pretty good. There was just the right amount of BBQ sauce on the sandwich, too. There was limited seating, which was spaced out pretty well to practice social distancing. Everything was going perfect. Everyone was happy and burping to their hearts content...I couldn't wait for the milkshake which surprisingly was a slight letdown.   The milkshake's actual taste was fine, and I loved all the oreo cookie bits at the bottom of it. The consistency of the shake was the problem. Most of the shake was watery which has ever happened when I've gotten a milkshake before so I'm not too bothered but it was almost like drinking a glass of milk and going to dip my cookie in, and drop it in my mistake lol   OVerall I enjoyed my meal. I wound up ordering some brussel sprouts to-go which they make really good here, and they let me switch the sauce out for their truffle mayo!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Sorry to say this, but I was really disappointed in this place.  The owner, a Romano,  is a nice Italian man.  His displays are lovely and he has a good selection.  But for this prices he gets, he should provide very fresh food - even that from Italy could be much, much better.  I'm thinking he's convinced  nobody here will know the difference, but there are many of us who know the difference and will figure out who has the goods (Buckingham Pizza) and who doesn't.

"I've only ever ordered take-out from here, so that's the basis for my review.  Pro: Easy to order online AND they have delivery.  Con: If you pick it up, you go to the bar. Not that going to the bar is a con, but being completely unaware of where the ""take out counter"" is located was a problem for me, especially because I had to wait a few minutes for the hostess to notice me.  Pro: I ordered pad thai and I was expecting the usual. However, I was surprised in a good way for sure with their unique version, featuring red peppers and jalapenos.  Their prices are fantastic for those looking for reasonably priced fare. Most things are under ten dollars and you get more than enough food.  One thing they could do a bit better with is making the place not seem like it used to be a blockbuster. Perhaps I am of a minority that recognizes it as such, but I'd still like to suggest that the owner get some curtains and wall lighting going on to give it more of a hip restaurant feel.  P.S. They have nice take-out boxes that you can reuse. Collect them all and you have a tupperware set.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I grew up in Bristol and lived there for nearly 30 years. The food was always fairly consistent. Good pizza and sandwiches and the service was always good. I've been gone for the past 15 years and recently returned to Bristol. Naturally I wanted to go back and try the food. I've given the place many many chances over the past several months, but I can say honestly, the consistency of the food is all over the place. One day the food is just as I remember it and the next I wonder what happened to the food. The menu has grown tremendously in the past 15 years which I think may be the root cause to the inconsistency. I am loyal to my home town restaurant and I will continue to try to support, I just wish it can go back to the way things use to be.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I was a bit under the weather and nothing cures me quicker than a heaping portion of some spicy Kung Pao Chicken. As I frequently drive on Ulmerton, occasionally I noticed a very cryptic sign on side of the road that simply said ""Chinese Restaurant."" So, I decided to check it out today.  Here are my ratings:  Quality of food: Bad. I have eaten Kung Pao chicken at a lot of takeout Chinese places. This was probably the worst one I have ever had. There were 2 tiny pieces of chicken, a huge pile of mushy mushrooms, and the sauce had no flavor. The egg roll was extremely greasy. I also like putting chili oil on my rice but since what I got was mostly oil and not any chili, that didn't help either.  Decor: Sad and depressing! First of all, they don't have any air conditioning. You can imagine how miserable it gets when eating hot food and having no a/c. There is one dirty and sad looking table fan blowing hot air throughout the room. To sit, they have booths with rips on the seat and foam spilling out. There was all kinds of random newspaper and kids toys on most of the tables.   Cleanliness: Questionable. I had to use the restroom and the kind of black and dirty walls that I saw along the way makes me wonder how clean their kitchen is. The toilet had no paper towels and no soap.  Service: Poor. They seemed to be very picky on who to be nice to. To some customers, the cashier/owner would smile and be cheerful while taking their orders. To others, they would look at them like they had no business being in the restaurant.  Speed of food preparation: Medium. The food did come out within 10 minutes of placing my order.  Price: Comparative to other Chinese takeouts. I paid about $7 for my entree that came with soda. The quality of food, however, was far from being comparable to other takeouts.  I do not recommend New China Beach. The depressing decor, very dirty bathroom, no air conditioning....all of that could be forgiven if the food was good. But, it wasn't and completely lacked in flavor and quality. I will not be back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
Always inconsistent: food is never made on time and food is never consistent in flavor.  Curry tilapia never taste the same per visit . Jerk chicken never taste the same per visit. The fried tilapia seasoning and curry sauce and veggies will be inconsistent in flavor . Sometimes tilapia is over fried. King fish is sometimes dried out and taste like chicken. Rice and cabbage will lack flavor and inconsistent. Chefs are just very inconsistent . I won't be back because I'm always disappointed when I do go.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

I've eaten a few meals at this location.  The first few times I ordered I asked if they could leave out any MSG and the gentleman I spoke with told me he would let the chef know.  Then I spoke with a woman at the front who told me that they could not take out any MSG.  She didn't understand why the gentleman was telling people this.  Most recently I went in on New Years eve and waited about 20 minutes for an order.  A number of orders were called in and they were processing them.  I ordered the vegetable chow mien and an egg roll.  When I got home the noodles were chewy and the order seemed to be bathed in oil.  The egg roll was ok.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

It had me reminiscent of frozen stouffers that I had in the early days of my adult life. Was this place ok? Sure. If I lived nearby I might come in here for reasonably priced comfort food.

"Made a reservation for 5:45 on a Saturday night. When we came in they could not find our reservation even though I had the confirmation text. Instead they told us we would be the next available table. Which resulted in waiting another 25 minutes for a table and it was outside. While waiting 2 other people had the same problem with their reservation being screwed up. Whats the point of having a reservation if they don't take you. Then our waiter took forever to come and when he did he only came to our table a few times not really even asking if we needed anything. 3 of our meals got messed up, missing things/ brought the wrong sides. Also our waiter didn't offer us bibs when 3 of the meals were the crab buckets. Food was good but definitely overpriced.

"Evidently Squeeze In is a bit of an institution in the Reno-Sparks area.  I was casting about on Yelp this Sunday, looking for a fun place for brunch, and this location was close(ish) to my hotel, so I checked it out.  The first thing I want to point out is the fact that, evidently, Squeeze In has been featured on the Food Network's ""Throwdown"" with Bobby Flay.  The place doesn't let you forget this for one minute.  While I don't blame them for kvelling about this feather in their cap, I advise caution.  Best not to overdo it.  The service was extremely congenial and spirited.  I was in a great mood and the staff responded to it in a way that enhanced my experience.  The menu is a diner lover's dream:  Kicky variations on classic recipes, all with fun, silly names.  They take the whole concept of American breakfast very seriously here, and that's a good thing!  I had the Spanish Flay (see what I mean about overdoing it?).  While it sounded spectacular on the menu --  red peppers lovingly sauteed in smoked paprika and butter, seasoned eggs -- it was actually surprisingly bland.  Not bad, mind you, but bland.  I also had a biscuit, which was terrific.  I was a bit surprised that they didn't offer me any butter or even interesting preserves or something to put on it -- just the standard issue Denny's-type miniature jam dispensers.  But still, a good biscuit.  If I lived here, I'd revisit Squeeze and work my way through the menu.  I am confident there are choices I'd enjoy more than the Spanish Flay.  The staff's friendliness and energy would also keep me coming back.  I was speaking to a gentleman who I think was one of the principals of the business, because he told me about a recent trip to San Diego, where they're looking to expand.  If only they'd come to Hollywood, where I live.  ""Rents are way too expensive,"" he told me.  Shoot.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Ordered a small salad, good stuff, lettuce, chick peas, olives, tomato, red onion. and a side of gorgonzola. Overall pretty good and filling. Now the pizza, I ordered a small traditional pizza with 1/2 sausage and mushrooms, 1/2 plain. Not the pizza I was expecting, crust a bit thicker than I like for a coal fired pizza, the sauce was applied like a grandmas pizza. Not the best tasting pie.

Between the salsa and the grease from the chorizo laced through, what must have been four eggs, the fourteen napkins were barely enough.

"Ever since I saw an ROTD on this place and I heard about coconut rice in coconut leaves with satay skewers, I was sold on this place. East Passyunk is poppin' and Sate Kampar really is quite the Malaysian ""street food"" restaurant I never knew I needed.   Growing up, I'm used to Penang being my baseline for Malaysian food but it always seemed to try to make too many dishes while being a bit pricey. Never in my wildest dreams would I have expected Malaysian to be like this! It's a small, cute restaurant with decor intended to look like a rugged Malay stand with skewers always on the grill with their coconut charcoal and little dishes. Did I mention that they have a ""bar"" area (it is BYOB here) but they don't make alcoholic drinks, they make pulled milk tea and Malay style coffee. Or if you're feeling adventurous, a mix of the two.  Overall, solid experience. Street parking is around E Passyunk (metered) and side streets. Waiters are friendly and awesome.

"Craving pizza on a Sunday night and discovered this inviting restaurant.  There is outside seating and lots of inside seating with TVs everywhere.     The host took our drink orders since our server was busy and since we had been drinking all day at the Savor Fest, we opted for Coke.  They arrived and were so sweet, we presumed they hadn't done the carbonation mix correctly.   When our server arrived we told him and he said it wasn't Coke, but cola and he always tells his customers when they order it because it's different.   We switched to iced tea, which turns out to have a very strong tea flavor.    The menu is what I expected from a place like this and we settled on cheesesteak egg rolls and a pizza with sausage and peppers.       The 3 egg rolls (who gets the 3rd one LOL) arrived quickly and were extremely good.   Juicy, tender meat in an egg roll served with a melted cheese.  Yum!  We ate then so quickly I forgot to take pictures.   Then.......we........waited.....and waited.    After about 35 minutes our server came and asked if we wanted dessert.    Told him we hadn't even gotten our pizza yet.   He knew that and was apologetic and wanted to get us free dessert.   We weren't in the mood and then finally 5 minutes later our pizza arrived.    The pizza was good and hot and the crust was so light it was easy to eat it all and not leave the ends.    We can't decide if it was the sauce or the sausage that was spicy, but I think it was the sauce.   I liked it.  They really deserve 3 stars for this trip, but since the food was so good, I gave them 4 because I know it was a screw up in the kitchen.    In the end, they made it right and gave us the egg rolls for free.    I wish they had different size pizzas.   One is too small for 2 people unless you get a side, but 2 is too much and when you are traveling, you can't do anything with leftover pizza.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

After he took our order and brought our wine, he acted like we were not his table.  Eventually, he brought bread to us on the way to another table, but I ended up refilling our wine the entire evening.  He was in the dining room, in fact, and continually walked by and by and by but would not look at us or acknowledge that we were in the restaurant.  Finally, as we were waiting for our check, we realized what was happening - all of the servers were talking about getting out early and going out or to parties.  Clearly, no one was riding herd on these twenty-something servers.  To top it off, they incorrectly charged my credit card, reversed it, and then ran it again correctly.  However, their merchant service takes up to a week to reverse the incorrect charge - so I'm out $120 for a week!

"We have been here multiple times, the food is mediocre at best but we go for the view. We took my mom to celebrate her birthday this particular time and were sat at a hexagon shaped table. My one year old was with us and needed a high chair so they brought a booster that sat on the bench. I thought it was strange but they must have done it several times for them to have brought it to us? So the food was coming I strapped my son in the seat and reached to grab my food, my son fell off the seat still strapped into this high chair hitting his head on the concrete and one foot from falling off the sea wall. I scrambled to pick him up and turned back around and the food runner was gone. Didn't stay to make sure he was ok. Nothing. Our server (jada I think) came back by and asked if someone fell and apologized. The manager (molly I think) came 15 minutes later, apologized and took the chair. I told her I didn't know if we were going to take him to the hospital yet I was going to see how he acted. She came back 15 minutes later asked for my name, nothing else, so they obviously won't be calling to check up on him. And after I was too shaken up to eat, brought me my check.

Nothing looked particularly appetizing in the Showcase however we went ahead and ordered a bagel with lox and cream cheese.

"Came to MRKT for a friend's going away party and honestly, I really wanted to like this place. At first I thought we were going to MKT and almost went to the wrong place. The wooden panels and curved ceiling give it a nice Scandinavian look to it. It has nice lighting and the high tables and chairs were comfortable but for some reason we were at this gianormous table that could probably have sat 24 people. There were about 10 of us and the other side of the table had a few people. It felt like Oktoberfest or something. The lower tables across from the bar were weird too, they looked small and uncomfortable.   Anyways so I started out with an Old Fashioned and my friends got some wine (although our server wasn't too educated on the selection, she would just relay my friends questions to the bartender.) My drink had a dash too much bitters but the bourbon was satisfactory, can't remember the brand. So we waited for more of our friends to show up and got some appetizers. My friends and I got the Bruschetta, this cheese fondue and the goat cheese. Those were literally the names of the dishes, not very creative. They were delicious though but I remember the bread being really hard. Ended up getting the Maple Bourbon Meatballs. For $20 I thought they were going to be a decent size portion but they were tiny and they weren't anything special. My dad makes better meatballs and he never cooks. I pretty much paid $4 per meatball and got some dry corn bread on the side. I ordered some palenta on the side just to make it a meal.   Oh yeah and the food took forever, like 40 minutes. Our service was ok, the waitress did her job but definitely wasn't too friendly and our bills took about 20 minutes for her to figure out. I don't understand why servers don't just separate the bills first and then group them later if one person is going to pay for the whole thing. Like how often does a big group just want one bill? The menus a bit overpriced in my opinion and then we had a 20% autogratuity. Which is standard for groups nowadays but I don't think we were told before we sat down. My last comment was the chalkboard menu on the wall, get real menus! Unless they do have then, then why would they need the chalkboard? Who wants to look over and around servers to decide what they want to eat? Plus it was obviously written by an employee during their slow shift, spend the extra dollar and class it up. Maybe it's because I've done a few chalkboard drawings professionally, I'm a little biased. Perhaps I could do some work for them. In the meantime I hope they make some other changes...

"I'm used to going to the one in Natick, MA (packed chaos!) but I came here on a mid-week evening, around 8:30 and it was dead.  The neighborhood didn't appear to be great, perhaps that's why.  Better for me since I was hungry.  The selection of rolls were slightly different than the one in Natick but they taste great.  I had some of the beef short rib and pork spare rib, along with a little bit of veggie tempura, miso soup, among others for cooked items.  The beef short ribs were a little chewy but the pork spare ribs slipped right off the bone as usual.  Unfortunately I didn't have any of the sashimi as I usually grab a bunch of salmon, but not this time.  I don't doubt it would've been tasty as everything else was.    Gotta save room for the green tea soft serve ice cream.  It's so good!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Johnny Sanchez had a pretty good happy hour: a selection of their tacos for $2, half off wine by the glass, well mixed drinks, beers and their signature margaritas.   The chicken tacos is AMAZING. I'd give it 5 stars on its own. The catfish taco was like a 4.75 star. Also tried their Mexican street corn which as ridiculously good. I loved it on the baked plantains they serve with their chips and salsa.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was fun and vibrant and the wait staff was friendly and had our food/drinks up pretty quickly.

"Rating is not for food but for customer service. I've ordered carryout twice now and don't get me wrong, the food is great, but when I had an issue with the company they use for their delivery service(Doordash) dropping the food off outside of my work at a hospital on a parking lot bench and not calling to tell me that resulting in the food sitting outside for 40 minutes....I contacted the restaurant as instructed to on the online order confirmation page, completely baffled that somebody would think that delivery was okay... The women I talked to, who I presume was the manager/owner was more concerned about having to make the food again and losing money for remaking one order for her company rather than catering to the customer that already paid for it as she said that exact thing to me twice on the phone... that she would be losing money, as if I wasn't in the same boat at that point?! Doesn't seem like the best way to support your customers...who are trying to support local. I was instructed by her to call Doordash to sort it out, which seems like something she should have done, given it's the company they trust to deliver their food and the driver was claimed to be one of their most frequent drivers. I ultimately got my food roughly 3.5 hrs after ordering it and although the food was delicious, the lack of customer service and concern around the whole issue left a bad taste in my mouth.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

I have to say, though, that I don't come here very often when I'm in Alton/Godfrey because of how it's been like a high school reunion with the people you liked least.   If you're in your 20s and went to Alton High, and you come on a Friday or Saturday, chances are you're going to run into one of those douchebags you hated growing up.

"So, we've driven by the gas lamp dozens of times, and it always looks closed. Plus, not much more than a sports-bar or generic ""casual american dining"" from the outside. Having read Mike S. review, and the hot tip on restaurant.com, I decided to give it a go. Inside was about what I expected, but clean. Kind of generically nice inside, everybody was pleasant and professional. Okay,  then the cocktails came. Normally, a cocktail is a cocktail, but these were great! Okay, then the food. We've been looking for a really awesome restaurant since we've moved to Reno. Beaujolois Bistro was the firs one to merit a repeat. Gas Lamp completely blew it away. Salmon carppaccio needed a little acid, but it was delish. Seafood stew was really tasty, a bit too much sausage for a seafood stew, but all tasty. Get the idea that I'm nitpicking? True. Pork chop, ridiculous. Perfectly medium, brined, but the mustard sauce was the topper. Wow. Really awesome. Just amazing. Best meal in Reno so far.

I kind of love this guy.  * There's a Subway in the back of this place. So weird.  * You need a code to use the bathroom.

They don't really have high quality fish in their rolls and they pull a lot of cheap filling (i.e. cream cheese, rice) to compensate for the lack of ingredients.

The chips and salsa were also very good, but the street corn was surprisingly delicious, we had the bowl so it would be easy to share. Now, to the main course, they were...just ok. My burrito, the East LA steak, was filling, yes, but it was missing some flavor. My wife also reported the tofu tacos had some flavor to be desired.

The antipasto salad for two was a pile of lettuce, 3 pieces of salami, 2 peces of cheese and a few olives; hardly worth 13 bucks.  The pasta sauce was bland on the entrees.   Part of the order was wrong.  The server was slow and mostly absent.  We took turns going to the bathroom and looking for him to find out where our orders were.

The manager checked our table in addition to just the right amount of checking by the waiter. Wine selection is very good. Is it pricey, yep, cause it's tourista-land all around, but oh so convenient to Union Station. We went very early, maybe that's best.

"So disappointing. This restaurant might be alright, but they definitely should not deliver.  We have had amazing food the entire time we've been in NOLA, but this was awful. I ordered the crab cakes. They were fishy. I've had fresher tasting crab cakes at home in Central Illinois. My husband got the jambalaya pasta. It was SWIMMING in grease. Two of my daughters got chicken Alfredo to split. It was also extremely greasy and a very small portion. The packaging was terrible. Flimsy styrofoam containers for a pricy meal is too bad. The containers were all crushed when we got them. The grease from the pasta dishes was EVERYWHERE. The girl that took my order on the phone was rude. They only take exact change cash as payment. I was told 45 minutes for delivery. It was an hour and fifteen minutes before it arrived. The delivery driver was super sweet. It's now 9pm and my kids are still hungry because it was basically inedible. Down to the hotel snack shop we go. So, $85 for dinner and we threw it away.

"Wow...this place is incredible!  The decor alone is worth the visit--old tires planted with palms, a dining counter made of tailgates, shower curtains strung by every booth, vibrant (some might say tacky) colors throughout, and an old rusty car gutted, suspended and made into a dining booth to boot.  Seriously.  They trailer trashed this place up (all sparkling clean, of course) to go with their signature trailer park comfort cuisine.  And, jumpin' jackrabbits (!!) do they have some stick-to-your-ribserific comfort food!  I ordered the macaroni and cheese which came with sweet potato fries and their signature trashy sauce.  I can honestly say the macaroni and cheese was the best macaroni and cheese I have ever been served in a restaurant--it was rich and tasted beautifully homemade with what tasted like a flavorful sharp cheddar.   The sweet potato fries were equally as marvelous and the trashy sauce was divine.  My dining companion ordered a chicken teriyaki burger which came with fries and an entire bottle of fry sauce (we do love the sauce).  Of his meal, he said (and I quote):  ""Holy crap...this is dripping with deliciousness.""  We ordered their version of a shake (more like a blizzard--vanilla shake mixed with various types of candy--we ordered the vanilla with peanut butter cups) to share.  I don't typically care for those and so I did not at all have high hopes, however, it was good.  It was not the traditional shake that I would have liked to have seen but it did have an ample amount of peanut butter cups throughout.  One thing to consider:  The service was a skosh slow (but friendly!), which may be a factor if one is going for a lunch hour.  Other than that?  A great find in a great location (smack in the middle of the Linen District)!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Right from the start, the atmosphere is old and stuffy, it's literally underground in a basement, has old decor, and is stale-feeling. There were a good amount of other people there, yet it was strangely quiet and we felt awkwardly like we were the only ones talking. Definitely an older crowd, and quite pricey. I think we each got two drinks, an entree, and a dessert and our bill came to around $160 (including tax and tip) so our Groupon didn't even begin to cover it.

"I came here today for the first time. I ordered a big kahuna cheese steak priced at around $8-9 for a regular size. You can get either a regular or big size. The bigger size is around $15. I expected since the cheesesteak was called ""big kahuna"" that it would be large even if it's ""regular size"", right? Well the cheesesteak I got was small, I would say even less than an average sized one that you would get anywhere else. So I was a little displeased.  But the cheesesteak was actually extremely tasty. So I'm eager to try other foods there in the future. I just don't like the con job of making a customer believe it's a ""big kahuna"" when it's not. It reminds me of how fast food places like McDonald's like to show images of large burgers ionly to have you order a much thinner sorry excuse of one.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Walked in, immediately got an old school local vibe, this is the type of place my grandpa would have regularly visited, it's cool.  The menu is massive, and has a lot of different sandwich options, and the girls behind the counter were incredibly friendly and helpful.  Two major problems I have with the location: 1. The slogan is literally along the lines of ""Women love swallowing"" and uh... wow. Explicit much?  2. Putting your political views on your business is a no-no. Whether I agree with you or not, I shouldn't know what political party your BUSINESS OWNER supports, because you're a business. This is an immediate turn away from any business, no matter the political spectrum.  The food is pretty good, fresh, great flavor, and a TON of meat on the sandwich. The prices tend to be better than Port of Subs and Subway, and the sandwiches bigger, but there isn't anything that makes it special.

The only drawback is it's a little pricey, $4 per mug, and refills are not complimentary.  I had the Lebanese egg scramble which was light and fluffy with gentle hints of both lemon and mint.  My husband asked for the West Indies veggie scramble prepared as a wrap and really enjoyed it.  Our friends ordered the Westcoast Wildfire omelette and the egg and cheese sandwich on gluten-free bread and said they were also quite good.  The bill is delivered by a sweet toy, which is kind of amazing.    One thing to be aware of, although brunch is served on weekends from 9a-3p, the lunch part of brunch (sandwiches, soups, salads) does not start until 11:30a, so if you're hankering for a tempeh sandwich or coconut Thai soup, it's probably best to sleep in a little.

Can't help but wonder if perhaps some of the reviews were done by in-house peeps. The Chilean sea bass (somehow mentioned as a great dish by other Yelpers) was sub-par in every respect: thin, NOT fresh, heavily sauced (unnecessary on a good fish) and quite literally inedible. 3 of 4 of us ordered the bass, none ate even a quarter of the dish and- amazingly- the waiter took the dish away and didn't offer something else.

HAPPY HOUR Mon. -Fri.  4-7PM as of 9/11/17 Domestic & Crafts: $3.00 Import Draft: $4.00 Seasonal Cocktails & House Wine: $6/glass  (SWEET POTATO TOTS 4/5): When you order it as an additional side, they present it in a large bowl with lots of crispy 2'' rectangular shaped sweet potato tots and since that's a nickname my mom gave me, whenever I see anything sweet potato related, I have to get it and try it! The exterior of the sweet potato was fried to perfection and crispy when you bite down into it, but it lacked the natural sweetness I am used to and for this reason, I'd skip this for my own personal reason.  FRENCH ONION SOUP 3/5): This is your standard French Onion Soup with nothing special or extraordinary that stood out. The soup was sort of warm and not hot like I expected. It was alright and I really can't think of anything special about it...  FILET MIGNON SALAD 5/5): Four out of eight of us at the table got this and it turned out to be a great choice! The seared filet was cooked medium and every bite was soft, not chewy or overcooked and on a bed of baby lettuce. I loove arugula intensely and I guess you could say I'm obsessed with it. The menu said arugula was a component of the dish, but I didn't taste any at all, so I was a little disappointed. However, the roasted tomatoes were a really nice touch and a nice change from your standard fresh tomatoes, so I really enjoyed that! The candied bacon was sprinkled on top of the filet and was one of my favorite parts of the salad and made it a complete meal combined with the green peppercorn dressing. I don't know if they made the dressing it in house; it was pretty darn gooood and not an icky, thick dressing. The dressing was light, refreshingly good and different from your normal Ranch, Blue Cheese, Caesar, etc.   BEER (5/5): They have a nice selection of craft, domestic, imports, speciality cocktails and wine. I love that they support local breweries and had to get the Beach Blonde Ale made by 3 Daughters Brewery in St. Pete. There are so many wonderful local breweries, making it an easy choice to choose what I wanted to drink. Kudos to them for supporting our local community!  Unfortunately, the customer service is not up to par. If you come during your 1 hr. lunch, good luck getting your food in under 45 minutes! Also, you should set aside at least 15 minutes or more to get your check...this isn't the first time where they fell on customer service and a reason I prefer not coming here during the weekday when it's so busy during lunch.

Sadly it was ruined for me before it even made it to the table as 2 servers didn't know what it was and kept holding it up to their face to try and identify it.  They could not, so they left the room and came back in declaring it pepperoni...It was obvious someone dug around on the top of the pizza to uncover the toppings and ID this pizza, so I was bent before I even tried it.    Tip for Unos:  buy some little toothpick flags and use them to ID your pizzas.       Had burgers on a couple occasions, decent but not going to keep me from Cheeburger Cheeburger.  The lunch steak was pitiful at 6 oz, but cooked a very nice medium rare.  I will never order a steak here again, but wanted to give it a shot.  Got the naked baked potato which is basically mashed potatoes with some toppings mixed in and a HUGE dollop of sour cream on top.  It is probably a lot easier for them to keep a pile of mashed potatoes available rather than a bunch of baked potatoes, but I must say I prefer the actual potato.  I sat at the bar to watch the World Cup, Olympics and the Euro.  They have many TVs in this area and there is hardly a place to sit without a good view in the bar area.  There are also tables around the bar that have waiter service which includes 3 tables right by the fireplace!    I will head back to watch TV at lunch and probably have some pizza and dessert!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"My parents live so close so when we are visiting we frequent the grill! I'd rate it a 4.5 and the only reason is sometimes we have shotty service. Everything I've tried is delicious, fried mushrooms, burger, chicken, salmon, pecan ice cream roll, Sweet potato fries, onion rings, sangria! I can't remember everything but it's alll good! It's a family place and great to bring your kids. Love the taproom downstairs too for a different vibe.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I visited this restaurant with three other friends and I enjoyed everything. The waitress (Sierra ) was five stars. Her knowledge of the menu was excellent. Sierra has a wonderful personality and was attentive to our needs as she was also taking care of other tables. Rachel was a waitress who is also a bartender. She also had things flowing well and under control while having a stress FREE smile and attitude. The manager came over to ask about our server and food. He wanted to make sure that everything was to our liking. He offered himself if there were any issues. He actually visited our table twice to make sure everything was ok.  I recommend Widow Fletcher's Restaraunt to anyone who likes a great atmosphere, attentive staff, good food and a very clean place. I also enjoyed the sign's post on the wall as you enter the restaurant giving the history of Window Fletcher. You can really see the owners put a lot of thought into the design and look of this restaurant. Oh and the dancing Dolphins outside our window was a great touch.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Extremely surprised by how good the food was for the area. This will definitely be our go to Asian spot in Medford.  We were the only table on this quiet Monday night and was sort of scared whether the sushi would be fresh or not. Well everything turned out great!    Our first dish was the yellowtail Serrano. We enjoyed it but had better elsewhere. The chicken lettuce wraps were delicious!! They didn't provide enough lettuce for the filling but brought out some more for $1 more. The star of the night was the spicy tuna pizza. The tortilla was nice and crispy and was topped with tuna, cilantro, tomatoes, jalapeño, and a sweet & spicy sauce that was just out of this world.   Highly recommend everyone to give it a try. The house salad dressing was tasty but my salad was just drowning in it. Did the chopstick shake by picking up a piece if lettuce and shaking it to get all of the dressing off. My husband, who doesn't typically like these Japanese ginger dressing actually devoured my salad.   Daughter got the beef lo mein which I didn't like but hubby and my little girl liked it. I felt it to be too oily and just one dimensional in flavor. Oh...almost forgot about the walnut prawns. These suckers were huge!  Most places make the coconut sauce so thick and heavy, that it takes away from the dish. Not at Vincent's!  The dish was lightly coated making the flavor of the prawns stand out. The apple slices added such a nice and refreshing surprise.  Can't wait to eat the rest of it for lunch tomorrow.  Hubby also ordered a few sushi rolls (typical Cali roll, honey boston roll, and the spicy snow crab salad roll).  Not the best rolls I've ever had but we left satisfied.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I have been coming to this bar quite frequently within the last year since my friend moved to the area.  It is the only real hang out spot in this area but it never lives up to its potential. The food is ok. The beer list is awesome but they are often out of a lot of the options. The end of the bar is flooded with employees just hanging out and management doesn't seem to care or be up to par. Some nights we get padded down and our bags checked like we are going through airport security which is a big turn off. Some nights the music is so loud bartenders can't hear your drink order. The other night I was one of 3 customers at the bar and it took me over 15 minutes to be served because the bartender was MIA. I will say, service is never a problem when Brian is there, he is amazing. He is one reason we haven't totally given up on this place and also that it's within walking distance from the apartment, otherwise we probably wouldn't go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"This morning while I was visiting my daughter in Tampa, we decided to go out to breakfast. We yelped the Brunchery and decided to try it. The front of the restaurant is very cute with bright letters on the front window.  It was not very crowded on this Monday morning, so we were able to seat ourselves.   Our waiter brought us fresh brewed coffee almost immediately and we ordered.  I had the Lox, egg, onion, and tomato omelette.  Three eggs filled by these delicious ingredients and a side of home fries.  There was plenty of smoked salmon inside and it was very tasty.  I opted not to order bread, but they do offer gluten free bread.  My daughter had the two egg, pancake and bacon platter with toast.  Everything is cooked fresh and to order.  Our waiter refilled our coffee often. The walls are covered with antiques and memorabilia. It is a delighted place and we enjoyed our morning breakfast.

"Let me tell you, I will be returning.   The sushi was great, the beer was great, the service was fine, but the Happy Hour deal? INCREDIBLE.   Their happy hour deal is buy one roll get one free (I'm sorry, are they losing money?). Also, as you're walking in they have this stand with these little cards about an app called OPER. I've never heard of it, but if you sign up and pay your check through the app you get $7 off your check! You do have to preload money in order to pay, but what I did was once we got the check, I signed up, did the math and subtracted exactly 7 dollars from the total bill and then added only that amount to my account so I would not have excess money in this app I would never use again.   All in all, for 2 rolls, an appetizer, and a drink I spent a whopping NINE DOLLARS.   (Make sure you tip your server on the check before you subtracted all these good deals, because that's just rude).   Great food, will definitely return.  Do hot guys work here?

"Met a group of GFs here for drinks and dinner on a Friday night. Had great service from drinks to dessert. Staff was friendly, and food was fantastic.  On a recommendation I had the cucumber collins. This was a refreshing surprise and perfect way to kick off a Friday after shopping.  Oysters were delicious. Spicy Asian shrimp appetizer is spicy. If you don't like spicy probably should steer clear. I like spicy so was happy it had a kick. Crab dip was very good. I had the lobster/shrimp stuffed cod. Fantastic. Friends ordered Cedar Plank Salmon, and Shang Hai Seafood Sampler. All complimented their dishes. Finished with the chocolate cake. Spent a few hours here and never felt rushed or uncomfortable.

This is a relatively small very trendy and noisy restaurant. It's long and narrow.  There is a couch in the front to wait for your seat with two retro TV's.  The kitchen is in open view of the customers.  The place is cosy.  No windows... If you want windows try the Mercer Tavern next door.   Staff were quite pleasant and professional.  Food however is mediocre.  Your entree is either roasted chicken or pulled pork with roasted potatoes.  Any other vegetables or salads are charged separately.  The pulled chicken burger also only came with roasted potatoes. Bun was hard.  $7 for a very small side of beans is expensive.  The side of grilled cauliflower was good value.  Might be better to simply order a number of sides and share.  They have a variety of mixed drinks $10 to $15. Churros were good.  If you want trendy this is a good place.  Mix of young and old.  And not one baseball cap in sight!  There are two private washrooms.  If you want a quiet intimate evening go elsewhere.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

We stood waiting to be seated with no sign of a hostess for 10 minutes. Our server was clearly wishing she was somewhere else. Not rude exactly, just not invested in her job. It took forever to get coffee refills and she forgot to bring our toddler's juice and the condiments we asked for with the meal. It wasn't that busy yet we waited a long time...for everything. The food was just okay. The Monte Cristo was overpriced and didn't come with any side dishes. We won't be coming back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"As promised to our server tonight (who I also think was the owner), a 4 star review.  I have to agree with another reviewer about not knowing whether to seat ourselves or wait. However, the tables were reserved tonight for a christmas party. My guess is seat yourself - it didn't seem that formal. If you are seriously going to give a low rating over this casual of a place to eat ... very well then.   Living in this area, I've been trying to find a place that serves a KILLER long island (My other reviews pretty much will tell you I live for a good long island). I've only found two places - one being O'Skis, and the other, Anchors. One drink pretty much set me in my place. Two drinks, well, let's just say I wasn't driving anywhere soon.   Service was a tad slow, but again, they were hosting a christmas party with 30 some odd people, and we weren't in any rush.   However, everyone in the group of 4 found the food to be delicious. Three of us ordered the sampler platter (where you get to pick 4 out of 6 possible sampler items), and each item was cooked perfectly, and tasted great. The chicken wings were awesome, the chicken tenders were great. I could't complain about the food.  The server/owner came to us multiple times during the night to make sure that everything was okay. However, the only thing I mentioned to him was the strong pour on the drinks: Yes - I *love* a strong pour. But, I don't want to be walking in a crooked line after two drinks.   If I had to offer one other piece of advice: Quicker Service. I didn't really want to wait that long for my first drink.  I didn't think waiting that long for a side salad/appetizer salad was that appropriate either, but I waited patiently, and it came. Maybe it was just the night, maybe it is just the norm - but I don't think it would hurt to bring these things out quicker.   The bottom line:  Would I come back - Definitely  Would I bring other people here - Of course  Would I recommend people to try it - Yes",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Not our first time, but my boyfriend and I stopped in here on a Football Sunday (in between games).  It's like the cook in the kitchen was taking the day off.  It wasn't a team effort, but our waiter was doing well.  It was all downhill from there.  The problem was the cuts of meat on the burnt ends (appetizer and entree portions) were nothing else but cuts of fat.  The meat was chewy and very much NOT worth the price.  It was like City BBQ on their bad day - only much worse.  Only 3 out of the group of pieces were good. For two people, we paid $43 and some change.  We always order water - we aren't ever charged for sugary beverages.  So, that price was just for bad food.  Everything else was somewhat edible.  The brisket was a little more dry than normal so I used the BBQ sauce to enhance the flavors, however, I feel like there wasn't much good in it to make this a memorable meal.  It lacked finesse, taste, and tenderness.    We won't be back, so continue with your lazy cuttings of meat.  It was the worst meal we ever had.  We should have gone to Weber Grill.  It was an insult to culinary creations in the kitchen.  Gordon Ramsay would have thrown a fit.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Sigh. You know how I said that last time ""medium"" was the perfect heat for the green curry? Well, tonight ""medium"" was sooooo not spicy.

That being said I cannot wait to come back for dinner because I discovered the seafood green curry. Not only does it have shrimp, but they throw in a soft-shell crab and crawfish. Not sure how the oilspill will affect the menu but for now this is a bountiful display of crustaceans. I can't wait to try it when they perfect my level of heat.

Once we got our order in there were more issues from there. It truly felt like we were being an Inconvenience even tho this is the service experience they were offering all other patrons.

The Buffalo Jumbo Shrimp, the Pineapple Infusion,  to the key lime pie was awesome. So when we realized that we was back in the neighborhood, we had to stop in. This time not so great, we had a party of 6 and it took a very long time for our food to come out from the kitchen. Had the pineapple infusion and not as good as I remember.... The Buffalo Jumbo Shrimp was good, really glad because that really save them from having a lower ranking. Had to half of slab of BBQ ribs with fries and Cole slaw. Ribs was good, but it was over cooked. Fries came out cold and the Cole slaw was just dry. My grandson had the cheeseburger sliders, and they came out dry and they didn't offer any condiments to help. Glad we had some ketchup that came with the cold fries.

Maybe fewer options, but better food on the ones they do serve. I've had a few different items there, and the tolerable choice is the Club. That's it.   The service could also use a pick-me up.

"Dysfunctional is the one word I have to describe this place. I will say we got there at 11 pm so maybe the service declines as the night goes on. To begin, it took FOREVER to get our drinks. I mean, ATLEAST 20 minutes. And then the waitress only brought half of them!  It is nice that they serve food until 2 am as we had been to a concert and were starving. We immediately ordered appetizers and had the fried green tomatoes and mozzarella sticks. The cheese sticks were good (homemade). I hate when you get the frozen ones that you could buy at wal mart. The tomatoes were enjoyable as well. They came with sautéed shrimp on top with a remoulade sauce. The tomatoes were fried a little too long, but other than that, good. We placed our order shortly after they. We waited 1.5 hrs for our food. It still wasn't ready so we ended up getting it to go. This is when the waitress became rude and snappy. She mouthed off to my sister repeatedly. She wasn't asking if we needed drinks and didn't check on our table for awhile. When the food finally came out, she brought the ticket over that was for the kitchen and showed it to me and said ""see, I didn't forget to put the order in...there's only 1 chef back there (blah blah)"".  Whatever. The service was inexcusable and I don't think I can go back. It's sad because the people I were with were there earlier in the night and said it was fun. They sat outside and listened to live music and enjoyed good service while drinking. I guess I'll never know!    Ps. When we finally got back to our hotel at 2 am to eat, the burgers and fried catfish was actually quite good. My crabby pattie as they called it did not have lump crabmeat.

"Bottom line: surprisingly unsanitary conditions but decent pie  Wife and i were in a bind - we needed dinner fast and we hadnt tried this place out yet so we phoned an order in and dropped in about 20 minutes later. When we called in they told us that they were out of regular crust AND pepperoni!  The two most popular items!!  (*whispering*: theres a costco across the street....!)  Anyways we arrived and the pizza hadnt come out yet so we had time to pay and find a table.  It was 7pm on a saturday night and the floor looked like it hadnt been cleaned in weeks.  There were bits of food everywhere in the floor as if there had been a grade school birthday party there for two days straight.  The floor was so greasy that my wife had a hard time walking around in her tall shoes.  The tables were covered in grease.  I cleaned down a table for us and it was pretty nasty.  The pie came out and we plowed through it.  The food was certainly the best thing about this place.  There only seemed to be one or two people doing anything - and it looked like they were trying to stay on top of the orders.    There were a couple other people working that could have easily could have been cleaning.  I was a cook for a year and it generally wasnt that bad behind the line.

"I visit SB pretty often and have come here a couple times before with my friends and the food is pretty good but the customer service has been consistently TERRIBLE. I'm not usually one to leave a bad review of a place, but I just couldn't let this one slide. The same hostess/waitress always gives off such a rude vibe.  Most recently, my friend and I walked in and were just completely ignored by the tall Asian hostess with long black hair. She looked like a college student and was younger than some of the other staff. She didn't acknowledge us and just completely ignored our presence when we entered. The restaurant wasn't even busy at the time. We weren't seated until after we asked her to. She gave us attitude when she seated us even though we politely asked to be seated. Her tone was also just rude and unnecessary.  Usually the hostess are the first people you see, so the customer service could be greatly improved if the hostess wasn't so terrible. Food was good but don't expect good service here especially from the young Asian girl with black hair. We also had to wait a long time for our check and the same girl was rude as hell. She dropped it on our table and left.  It just made me not want to come back here again and I probably will not.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"""You have to go to Pancake Pantry."" That's what everyone told me when I mentioned my husband and I were going to Nashville for the weekend. We knew there would be a wait, but we were prepared (we are a small snack before leaving our hotel). It was raining and cold, so the line wasn't as long as I'm sure it can get. That being said, I was still surprised we had to wait 30 minutes to get seated.   I'm a very low-maintenance restaurant goer. When I sit down, I like to be greeted within a few minutes, even if it's to just give me a head's up that their slammed and will come back to take my order. I totally get that it's Sunday morning and you're busy -- just a smile and an acknowledgment would suffice. We sat at our table for about 15ish minutes before a waitress came over to take our order. This was after we made a comment to the hostess about not being waited on yet. When she did come, she was very defensive with us about how busy she was and how she would have gotten to us eventually. She then didn't speak another word to us. Not even a ""thanks for coming"" as she dropped off the check. She just silently placed our food on the table, never came back to check if we needed anything else, and then dropped the check off. I'm sure the service -- like all restaurants -- can be hit or miss so I'm not saying that should keep you from going, but it's just not the vibe I'm looking for when I dine out.   All in all, the food was pretty tasty and that's why I'm giving three stars. I got the savory corn cakes and they were delicious. I've never thought about making savory pancakes before, but these were great. I loved the combo of the green chili, bacon and cheese. My husband got the apple walnut pancakes which were drenched in a compote that -- while being tasty -- make the actual pancakes rather soggy. I would recommend getting the compote on the side if at all possible. We also split an order of chocolate chip pancakes and those were very delicious. I'm usually partial to chocolate chip pancakes with the chips actually in the pancakes, but the pancakes themselves were so fluffy that I could get past that.   Despite the food being good, we'll probably check out a different breakfast place the next time we are in town, just because there is so much good breakfast in the world and I want to experience as much as I can.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
One of the best Chinese food places around have been going here for years! Always fresh and well done!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Bamboo House offers cheap standard Chinese carry-out food. It can be a lifesaver when you want something more casual, in close distance, and with large portions. It is mainly focused on carry-out and delivery orders, not really a place you would go to dine-in.  I've ordered the General Tso's bean curd, shredded pork with garlic sauce, hot & sour soup, dumplings, etc.  Nothing was life-changing or unique, but the food was hot and fresh...and was easily spruced up with chili crisp and Sriracha. The portion sizes are huge and you can often get 2-3 meals out of one order.  There are multiple families who work at Bamboo House, and you'll often see a kid hanging out in the dine-in area while mom/pop cook or deliver food...sort of charming.  Regular customers are recognized and the customer service is prompt and friendly. There is a lot of parking, as the older mini mall it occupies is mostly vacant space.  Bamboo House is a nice option when you get the craving for Chinese food, but don't want to put a lot of effort into satisfying it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I haven't been here in over two years... Im glad we came back!! The staff is just amazing. We tried the tortilla soup and the avocado fries as appetizers; the tortilla soup tastes great and the avocado fries and definitely something different to try... the chipotle sauce is spicy so if you like spicy, you will love this appetizer. I had the green enchiladas and they were super delicious, I would've preferred shredded chicken because they cut the chicken in small chunks but overall they were good. We also had the shrimp chimichanga... also great flavor. The rice and beans are SUPER good. It's good to be back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This has nothing to do with ""fresh"". Avoid it like the plague, or else you might just pick it up there. This place is disgusting. Even my 8 year old noticed! The owners don't care about this place and the food is nasty. Need I say more?  The food was expensive for how bad it was. I found what I THINK was a piece of bone in my taco salad (I hope it was that!)  My daughter refused to go to the bathroom there choosing to hold it because she thought the bathrooms would be cleaner at the museum across the street. She never even went into these bathrooms.

An average Chinese Buffet joint.  I do have to say they do have a very large selection of items; including sushi and a Mongolian stir fry area.  They do seem to rotate the foods rather quickly and the flavor of the food was ... good. But like most buffets things tend to get dry and overcooked.  As far as buffet's go this one is better than most.  And don't get me wrong sometimes I'm in the mood for a buffet.

"I have had mixed experiences at the Kilt-   First off let's go positive-  the bar staff that has taken care of me- pretty great- good recomendations, easy to deal with, always smiling and laughing!  Also positive, the food and most of the drink specials.  Negatives-  Having to stand outside because they are at capacity on a random Saturday in January at 9 o'clock at night-  find hard to believe since there was plenty of room to stand and seats open, just not open tables. Second negative- one night when out bartender was cut- no one took care of us for half an hour- finally offered money to pay to a random who walked by and no one checked us out.  Talked to manager who could have cared less.  I will probably give it another try, have been 3 times so far, but not sure it will come one of my regular stops.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I remembered Aunt Polly's being great when I was a kid.  I don't think I'd had any food from there since the 90s.  It was on my list of places to try ever since I came back to the Indy area.  After moving back to the east side after twenty-plus years, I finally got some Aunt Polly's delivery just before the new year.    It was a Friday night, and they were apparently extremely busy.  I was asked to hold, and the phone was set down where I could hear several other orders being taken.  I decided to hang up and called back a little later, hoping to let the rush die down.  I was able to place my order right away when I called back.  I ordered way too much, but I was entertaining kids.  The wait was over an hour and a half.  The delivery driver was nice.  The food on the other hand was not so great.  One of the pizzas seemed undercooked with a heavy, doughy crust and gooey cheese, while the other two spent a little too much time in the oven.  They had dark, tough cheese and large charred pieces falling off the underside.    The breadsticks were the worst I have ever had.  Heavy, undercooked, and inedible.  I even tried to bake the breadsticks longer in the oven later on, but I ultimately threw most of them away.  Some of the food seemed to have sat around a while longer than the rest.  Along with the cold marinara and nacho cheese that came with the breadsticks, the breaded mushrooms I got were lukewarm, soggy, and falling apart.  A far cry from what I remember way back when.  Their mushrooms used to be my favorite thing on the menu.  I didn't try them myself, but the mozzarella sticks seemed to be a hit.  They appeared to be hot and crisp.  The leftover mozz sticks reheated well along with the breaded tenderloin.  The tenderloin was eaten by the biggest food critic I know, so it must have been good since there were no complaints.  The best thing we received was the side salad.  Even though it was made with Iceberg, it was fresh and came with a lot of toppings.  It was better than the side salads at most places.  Of course, the cheapest thing I ordered was the star of this mess.  It was highly disappointing to drop so much money and receive so little especially when most of the food was barely edible.   My memories of Aunt Polly's have been permanently crushed.  I doubt that I would order from here again.  Such a waste.  I still cringe with regret.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I went to Morgan's Pier the first time Saturday night and was quite amazed how big this place is.  I arrived at Morgan's Pier around 10pm, there was a $5 cover and the place was PACKED. Luckily my friends had gotten there before I had and got a table.    I ordered the Melon Margarita and it was quite yummy.  I didn't try any food but I definitely will next time.  The service was on the slow side - probably due to fact that the place was extremely crowded.  The music was a little too loud and the music selection was pretty terrible (wish they were playing top 40).  Needless to say, there was still a big crowd of people dancing.  As far as dress code goes, I would dress casually - I did see people wearing heels and dresses, however, I wouldn't waste a nice outfit on this place. Throw on a dress or jeans and you're good to go.    The view is also okay, you get a clear view of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and all the little boats.

"My co-workers and I work down the street, and we were looking for a place nearby for Happy Hour. They happened to have wine half-off on Tuesdays along with their normal happy hour menu, so we decided on Heist. I had been here a couple times before and liked the pizza enough to come back. But, I have to say both their service and food tonight was better than average and deserved mention. Appetizers: They had 2 chef specials today (May's Concoction): 1 was a zucchini fritter with some kind of garlicky white dipping sauce (It was amazing, my description is not doing it justice), and the other was a fried lasagna over marinara with alfredo on top. We also ordered the Godfather Dip. The bread they served with the dip was amazing on its own - perfectly seasoned with pockets of gooey cheese. I could've eaten the bread alone, but the dip was a perfect pair to the crusty, cheesy bread. We split all 3 appetizers between 5 of us, and there was enough for all of us to have a taste of each.  Drinks: The drinks were nothing special, but they did make a special accommodation for my coworker. The cocktail of the day was some lime-spritzer concoction that didn't sound too exciting. Our server had the bar jazz it up to impress.  Main Course: I ordered a pizza for people to try and to have for myself for dinner/leftovers. While looking through the menu, I saw that they had cured Italian meats I hadn't tried. After a quick google search, I decided on coppa. I ordered the Yukon (potato) pizza with coppa added. Boy was that an amazing pair. The rosemary and olive oil paired with the slightly sweet savory seasoned potatoes and the salty, rich coppa...mmm. I even tried a piece cold right before writing this review. Amazing! Our server was also very attentive. Besides having the specialty drink made, he was at our table often getting us drinks, busing, and getting our checks on time when we wanted to skeddadle. I was very impressed.

"Today we tried CC for lunch.  The reviews on the Cuban sandwich sounded amazing.  I ordered the Cuban sandwich.  It comes in a few sizes, but for me the 9"" was plenty big.  The bread was classic Cuban bread which is soft, flaky, & tasty.  The sandwich was pressed which is to be expected.  The quality of the meats inside was excellent, meaning there was nothing questionable in it, lol.  The only issue is that while the sandwich tasted fine, there was nothing exceptional about it.  I feel like I'm missing something, because this was no different than a bizillion other Cuban sandwiches I've had elsewhere.  The girl who took my order was pleasant & overall everything was good.

"Zagol's food is absolutely delicious, but you have to be willing to try something new.  There are no forks, spoons, or knives - you use the flat/spongy bread as your utensil.   The injera (the flat bread) was not what I expected it was going to be.  It is served cold, and it reminds me of a sponge, but you quickly get over that once you taste all of wonderful food!   A large group of us went and we ordered a lot of food - Doro Wat, Alicha, Key Wat, Gored Gored, and Zilzil Tibs all of which were amazing. The only thing I would change is to have more of the bread, because in my opinion they didn't serve enough of it in comparison to the amount of food they give you. The owner was very nice and talked a lot about the background of the food and the tables all have interesting facts about Ethiopia on them, which are fun to read while you wait for your food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"The food was excellent. We are novices when it comes to Indian cuisine but pros at the dining experience. First, it's in a box store strip mall but we heard the food was so good that did not deter us from trying it out. The decor is nice so once inside you forget that element. The menu is very vague so for someone that does not know much about Indian food you will need to rely on the server to explain what things are. And this is the reason for the low review...this was the worst server I have EVER had. He knew nothing about the food. 30-40% of the items had Paneer in the dish. What's Paneer? The waiter had no clue??? It took 15 minutes to get wine glasses and when we wanted a second bottle opened it took 4 requests before one of the other wait staff finally saw our frustration and came to the rescue.

"Visited Philly for the weekend and had the absolute best meal here. On a Friday night my fiancee and I were able to walk in and sit at one of the bar tables in the front room. It was perfect because unlike New York restaurants, tables were all pretty far away from each other so you had privacy. If you don't have reservations, I would say aim for the bar.   The restaurant itself was beautiful. Clean space with high ceilings and dim, but not dark, lighting.   Service was on point. Our waitress gave us the lowdown on all the dishes, offered great suggestions, and was never far if we needed anything. At the end of the meal we ended up chatting with who I would assume is the general manager and he was delightful. He made sure everything was to our liking (it was) and gave us a long list of restaurant suggestions.   The food... THE FOOD! It was so good!! The mix of flavors and textures is what I know vegetarian/vegan food can be! I loved the fancy radishes small plate. It was so lovely to look at that I didn't want to eat it.

Atmosphere is good, bar area is conducive for a variety of seating and different size groups, and the happy hour choices are solid.   But...food is so-so. First visit, my wife and I shared spicy tuna sushi roll. No need to 'lightly' deep fry this...and the teriyaki glaze is thick. Just stick to basics.   Wife ordered a chicken salad, which was standard and I had a burger. Roll was dry and fell apart (we attended a Sat night dinner), and the fries were very oily.   Tonight we had nachos, which were disappointing. $9.50 for a small plate of nachos, that 4 of us attempted to split. The waitress wasn't much help to advise about the smaller portions and try to upsell another app.   Entrees were standard: chicken salad, burger, turkey burger and chicken sandwich...all of which were suffice.

My wife and I ate at Gabby's after visiting the gun show and using the yelp app to find something new to us in the area.  I'm glad we did.  I was surprised they weren't busier on a Saturday afternoon but I'm not complaining.  We both got the Gabby with the SP fries.  The brugers were great!  One reviewer mentioned the bun getting soggy.  You have to flip the burger over onto the thicker part (lid) of the bun asap (actually I do this anytime I get a burger from anywhere).  That way the heat from the burger doesn't cause it to get soggy.    I usually pick regular fries over SP fries but I really liked Gabby's.

"The common thread amongst all the reviews here so far is that the service sucks but the food is good. That's my assessment of this Montana's as well. I'm Jeff G and this is my story:  I went here recently for a birthday dinner with my wife and in-laws and the staff completely forgot about my order. It was actually funny in an annoying kind of way. After the server brought everyone's food to the table she looks at me and says, ""uhhh . . . did you order anything?"" (Her exact words) I should point out that the person delivering the food was not the same one that took the order. She returned after a minute and said that my order would be ready in ""one minute - tops!"" Keep in mind that this is ""restaurant-speak"" where one minute equals about twenty minutes in the real world.  Our actual waitress did write my order down, I saw her do it. It was the kitchen staff that made the mistake. My brother-in-law ordered the same thing as me, the Peppercorn Cookhouse Sirloin. The kitchen people didn't pay attention to the quantities on the order slip so they just cooked one steak. His.  So in the meantime I'm waiting, waiting, waiting. Everyone at the table is feeling sorry for me, offering me bits of their meals as they eat away. I'm feeling like a dog begging for scraps at the table. Eventually, 20-25 minutes later the manager brings my food. That was the longest ""minute"" of my life. I know she was a manager/supervisor-type because she had a different colour shirt on than the rest of the staff. That's how those in the restaurant world establish their hierarchy - different colour shirts. She had some convoluted story about why I was forgotten about. Basically she was trying to tell me that they screwed up without sounding stupid which is hard to do. My steak ended up being on the house, which is the important thing. Nothing says ""I'm sorry"" like free steak.  The steak was very good. Not quite worth the wait, but good nonetheless. I felt the need to wolf it down because by that point, the rest of my family had finished eating.

When we called to find out what happened, they admitted they made a mistake, but in order to get either a refund or the missing tacos, we would have to go into the restaurant!  So now we are hungry and out $17.05 for a measly 2 tacos!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"This was my second time here and my first time having a sandwich (with bread) in years so I was really looking forward to a nice treat.  The first time I ate here I think I ordered a salad and I remember it being a lot better.  There was no cookie and no side with a $13.00 sandwich!   (Shoulda gone to Sup).  We each ordered whole sandwiches and sat on the deck because it was a sunny Saturday afternoon.  Even though I didn't pay, $30 bucks for two sandwiches is disturbing and makes me cringe.  My sandwich, the Cambie, was literally all bread.  The other, with Jalapeno cheddar bread, is the Rubicon sandwich and was much better because the bread was a little more thin.  All in all, I will not choose this deli for the next time I decide to eat a sandwich.  *If anyone has a superb sandwich recommendation, please let me know!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"One of my favorite breakfast/lunch places in Santa Barbara.  I love their french toast: baguettes w/berry sauce and vanilla whipped cream! An orgasm in your mouth, I crave them all the time. It comes w/3 or 4 pieces so I always leave full.  For lunch, the pulled pork sandwich is amazing.  It comes with homemade chips and an onion (or shallot, not sure) dip that is to die for.  I ate here once for dinner.  Can't remember what I ordered, but I wasn't that impressed. Better for breakfast & lunch!  Pros: friendly service, great food, delicious coffee (Peet's), good o.j., rarely a wait, good sized portions Cons: Kind of pricey for breakfast at $13-$16 a plate & because it's hard to resist their delicious beignets, lattes, and o.j., it adds up.  Not in the mood for a basic breakfast served by sometimes bitter waitresses at Cajun Kitchen? This is the place to go.

Great place for a special night out. Who would have know that this place is in Riverside NJ?! It seems like a Center City kind of place. The decor is gorgeous. Hubby had the scallops and I had the filet mignon and both were very good. Service was excellent although we had to wait awhile when we were ready to get the check. We went to the bar area-which is gorgeous also with comfy seating and a fireplace- afterwards for a drink and the band was setting up. We stayed for a few songs and vowed to come back a different time just for drinks and dancing! The outdoor patio area looks great also and can't wait until warmer weather to take advantage of that space! Lots of free parking in the back and right across the street from the Riverline train.   Highly recommend for a special night out as it is a little pricey (but worth it!),Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"It may have been just the ecstasy I felt to be able to get out of the house for a little bit following my recent hospitalization, surgery, and extended rehab in-home, but I was pretty darn happy on this Christmas Eve as a pastor friend of mine gently prodded me to attend her Christmas Eve service and then took me out to dinner following the service.   I'm not someone who regularly goes to Ruby Tuesday - truthfully, I've always found them to be a bit plain. However, we were nearby and Texas Roadhouse was overly packed and didn't really sound particularly good.   So, we opted for Ruby Tuesday.   Started out of Tennessee in 1972, Ruby Tuesday is now a nearly 500-chain restaurant with multiple locations in the Indy area. I believe the restaurant would fall into the ""casual dining"" arena with similarities to the likes of Applebee's, O'Charley's, etc.   Ruby Tuesday's offers an endless salad bar as one of its key features. Those I know who've tried it have generally spoken well of it. The menu seems to vary between your usual sandwiches and somewhat higher-end options including steaks, seafood, etc. They also offer a pretty full bar with regular $5 drink specials.   As I recently experienced an amputation that increased my accessibility needs, I was particularly concerned as my stitches were only removed this week and I really needed to make sure I wasn't set up for failure. They offer accessible parking that is level to the ground. They have double-wide doors that are fairly easy to open. There's a hosting area directly in the door, though on this Christmas Eve at about 7 pm there wasn't anyone directly at the station. I only waited a couple of minutes for someone to arrive.   We were seated at a comfortable two-top near the front of the restaurant. The hostess removed a chair for the wheelchair. Our server, whose name I never got, was super friendly in a sort of down-home, familiar kind of way that you either really love or really hate. It was quite nice.   While I usually get a burger, with my stomach still being a little unpredictable and me still learning transfers (read between the lines) I opted to get a safer meal and went for the fresh, grilled salmon. I did go ahead and get tater tots along with coleslaw. The meal came in at $17.99, as I recall, and I ordered my usual unsweetened iced tea.   I really enjoyed the salmon quite a bit. It was super fresh and had a hint of lemon to it that was an absolute delight. The tater tots were solid - the order size was kind of modest, but that was workable. The coleslaw was a bit too heavy on vinegar for me, but I still enjoyed it and ate all of it.   The meal was a solid 4-star.   The server was friendly throughout. She was timely with refills and attentive without being intrusive. She even got us a beverage refill to go.  She was definitely the kind of server you'd look forward to having as a server.   However, overall, I'm going to stick with a 4-star rating. This was a very nice meal and it was a great first outing for me. I didn't try to use a restroom but was able to maneuver fairly well. The food was good, the service was excellent, the atmosphere was inviting, and it was a nice way to close out my first opportunity to really get out since surgery. It helped build the confidence a bit, though I'm still limited to others driving.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"This was our first time eating here. We had it delivered to us. The chicken was very good, the ribs were quite dry but good flavor, the brisket was mostly fat. The macaroni and cheese was good. The brisket chili also was good. We were given a small sample of cole slaw and it was very good. My husband said the pulled pork was dry but had a good taste. He had the macaroni and cheese and pit beans and said both were good. We neither one liked the popover but we are not bacon fans. We both had the Bestie Sweet sauce. It was good but a bit spicy.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The hell? I've never reviewed this place? Aight, here we go.  Nam Phuong is a good spot. I just can't give it 4 stars because it doesn't excel in any of the dishes that I love getting at other Viet spots that I love.  I feel bad writing that, but it's true. When I have their pho, I'm thinking of Choo Choo (Pho Xe Lua Viet Thai). When I have their cha gio or grilled meats, I'm thinking of Vietnam Palace. When I have their vermicelli... well, vermicelli was always just a standard for me that never really stood out anywhere, so they pass on that.  They prepare their beef salad - drained raw flank steak marinated in lime juice and tossed with herbs, peanuts, and fried shallots - in the style that Cambodians do, using ample sawleaf herb and some other things I don't know the names for in English. But, even that is done better, in my opinion, at Khmer Kitchen.  Don't get me wrong - if anyone suggests we go get a bite at Nam Phuong, I'm the last to shoot them down. It's a wide open pair of dining rooms separated by a low wall, you never feel crowded, and it IS authentic, genuinely good food. The service is prompt and friendly enough. And hey - cheap liquor and beer if you're so inclined.  But, again, all of those things are available at other places that I tend to enjoy more.  You will likely enjoy every dish you get here, and portions are heart-attack large. That makes this place solid.  But, again, for me, they're in that middle space where I can't think of one thing that I prefer at Nam Phuong above other restaurants.  All I can say is for you to go here and try it all yourself - you might love it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Sketch is probably the right name for this experience, that I wanted badly to feel but didn't. Hungover and needing the revitalizing hot beef and cheese injection experience, I was led astray into the sobering grunge of Fishtown in midday sun and felt worse for the wear pretty much across the board.  The place is going for laid-back neighborhood vibe, but finishes a note too swarthy.   Pros -Dipping sauce... it's just mayo in a variety of disguise but still delicious. -Old dog on the floor. -Crayons  Cons -A burger too far - some inventions are too good to mess with. You don't need to reinvent the wheel, you can't build a better mousetrap. Same with burgers. Sketch got too high concept on the 'smashed onion burger' for example, and I paid the price with his huge mess. Unwieldy and over-complicated, it seemed all I could taste was cheese and burnt onion. Maybe that's someone's thing. Not mine. -Cheese - I never thought I'd say this, generally being a big fan, but when your entire enormous patty is covered in a half-inch thick layer of congealing pepperjack, it's a little off-putting. -Milkshake-down - big, undifferentiated soft-serve with a pump of coffee syrup for like $6.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"The Patterson House is my go to spot for date night and happy hour.  The ambiance is perfect, it's quiet, dark, and TV free.  Every time I go, I leave feeling satiated and happy.  They have a great selection of drinks, and every drink is made with top notch ingredients and served with expertise.  The service is prompt, but not pushy, and you have time to relax and enjoy your drinks and food.  The drinks are $12/drink, but I think you'd spend that much if you ordered a custom made drink with top shelf alcohol.  The food is small plates, although they do have small pizza's which are enough to split as an appetizer, the marinara pizza is wonderfully simple, tomato, basil, and truffle oil.  The hummus with grilled sourdough flatbread is delicious, the hummus is not overly garlicky, and the sourdough flatbread is warm and chewy.  I have not had anything there that I've been displeased with, and it's one of the only places my Manhattan loving husband never complains about his drink.

"I've visited Ron's over the years and one thing has remained consistent: the food is great. No matter what you get you'll be happy. Same can't be said about the time it takes to get your food. At first glance you might think the long lines you'll most likely encounter are due to the volume of business, owing to lots of people coming to get the great food. While standing in line you'll come to realize the lines are because the design of the traffic flow is horrific and waiting on each customer is a painfully slow process.  The redesign of the restaurant has made it worse which is the main reason there's always a line of faithful, patient customers.   The new monitors that display the menu are pretty, but kind of far away from where you're standing in line so if you need glasses for distance don't forget to bring them. And frustratingly, once you've squinted enough to get a read on something, the screen ""refreshes""; starts spinning around and a new image appears.  Because they don't have any written menus available to read while waiting in line, when you finally are served, you're faced with a lot of good food but uncertain of what goes together in the small or large dinner dishes, or the platter.  There's so many offerings you feel a bit silly asking the clerk to run down all that there is and end up just ordering anything so as not to aggravate the people waiting behind you.  The stations where you go for service don't make any sense and don't appear to have resulted from any meaningful planning; you can't see the full selection of offerings from most of them, so again, ordering is  guessing game.  My guess is most of the customers are regulars who end up ordering the same thing over and over without needing to see a menu.  The occasional or new customer will most likely be aggravated by the wait and the inability to figure out what's included with the combinations of offerings, or even what the sides are.  But the food is delicious!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I had someone pick up food for me, so my review considers only the product as I did not see PT's interior. Since the place that was in this location closed sadly, I was looking forward to trying the new trendy fast casual place in town. I really really wanted to like Pipeline Taco, but I felt the food fell short of the tasty taco treats expected.   I ordered 3 tacos (chicken, pork and beef), guacamole and chips. I gave two stars because each of the 5 items were just so-so, flavor overdone and unbalanced, or did not sit with my palette at all. I'm not sure if I just received a rushed order or someone new assembled it, but for near twenty bucks ($19) or even $10, I would have liked to see all of the items executed well.   At Chipotle, I can order tacos (with the most expensive meat option) along with 2 guac and chips (to match PT's guac portion size) for $13.20. I am happy to pay the small business premium, but only if the food is AT LEAST as good as a competitor, if not even better.   **Chicken taco - 3/5: This one was my favorite. The chicken was tender, and the sauce and salsa were good. When I say good, it was good relative to the other tacos, but not too good when one considers being introduced to a new dish and seeing the flavors meld well.   **Beef taco - 2.5/5: This one was reminiscent of tacos you can buy from the grocery store and assemble yourself at home; hard-shell, very fine beef, and Old El Paso. It tasted good because it was familiar, but maybe a little too familiar.  **Pork taco - 1/5: The pork was very tender, but all of the flavor and sauce on the pork was overbearing. The flavor of this taco can be improved if the amount of the sauce/salsa is significantly dialed down to 1 tablespoon instead pouring a lot of it on. I had a hard time enjoying the pork and the tortilla because all I could taste was the sauce...and it was just too strong.  **Guacamole - 1/5: Be aware that this is not guacamole like one would expect with cilantro, onions, garlic or lime. I tasted cucumber and lemon (??) mixed in...which for me did not taste right. Another yelper in a review below wrote that this guac is only avocado, lime and salt....which is ok, but the guacamole was overmixed with too much citrus and was browning...drowning out the avocado taste....and channeling cucumber flavors??!!  **Chips - 1/5: They were greasy and sprinkled with salt, and carried a bitter aftertaste. I assume the taste comes from the oil used to fry them in. I could not enjoy these by themself either, even without the guac.  Another element I found missing as of this writing is I could not locate a website for Pipeline Taco and could not read about their story anywhere. On their facebook page their about us only had, ""So good - it'll break your mouth."" I hate to say the obvious, but the opposite was true for me...so bad, it broke my mouth )-: .  Seeing that their story is not easily accessible, I feel as a customer I do not have the context of the type of food business PT is aspiring to be.  Yelp has PT listed as Hawaiian and I was told there was a lot of surfboard garb inside. I can tell these aren't intended to be Tex Mex/Mexican-style tacos (or are they???) because the flavors are way different, but is there a theme they are suppose to be? Are these the types of flavors you can find in CA or HI? Somewhere else? Is this just an experimental flavor taco joint? Not sure...some education and information would be appreciated especially around what to expect.  I may try Pipeline Taco again in the future, but not for a few months until they're mostly done working out their growing pains.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I've eaten here three times over the past year and a half, and while the food has been absolutely outstanding (as others have mentioned), I've found the service to be lacking.  The first time I was there the server threw away the food we asked to get to go. The place isn't cheap and we had enough food for at least lunch the next day. Oh well... things happen.  The second time we were there our server took forever to serve us. We sat for 15 mins without him even stopping by, and the lack of service continued throughout our meal. My water glass sat empty, our plates of food sat on the table for a long time... at least they didn't toss our leftovers. The place was busy, but there were also many empty tables, so it wasn't at capacity.  The third time was the same as the second time - lack of service.  I live less than a 5 min walk to the restaurant, and I'd like to go there more often, but I like to actually be served properly when I'm at a restaurant.

"I was quite unwhelmed by the food and it was not worth the price in my opinion.  The restaurant is quite dark so makes it difficult to see menu and the food well. We ordered appetizers, had fried calamari and beef carpaccio. The fried calamari was under cooked. The breading was falling off the calamari and it was not crispy and just looked unappetizing.  I should have sent it back, but we didn't. Also I order beef carpaccio. I was not impressed with that either. The menu said it came with shaved black truffles, Piave cheese, truffle aioli, and micro arugula. The Piave cheese was there as was the truffle aioli and micro greens, however there was no shaved black truffles that I could see. Also the beef had no flavor. I needed to add salt.  Dinner came and both my companions had prime rib. They said it was ok, but it was a bit tough. I had Scallops. They were under cooked. Not much of a sear on all of them. The best part of the dining experience was at the end.  We had a tasting flight of Port. The gentleman who brought my wine and the Port flight was excellent. He was great and was our server.  So service and the Port saved this experience because the food was not so great and definitely not worth the price.  Probably won't go back because it is just too pricey for what you get.

"We had the jerk nachos, which was delicious. it was layered with jerk chicken, guacamole, mango, sour cream and pinto beans. the hint of mango gave it a nice kick. I also had the Jerk Chicken Burrito. I was expecting more, but the jerk chicken was disappointing. It was more on the dry side compared to the jerk chicken i've had in Jamaica. however, the avocado in the burrito made it a nice treat.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I visited Par Lounge late on a Friday night with a friend. We've driven by this place several times so we wanted to check it out. Par is right next to Hi-Pointe Theatre (which is awesome btw). And if you're a smoker, Par is the perfect place to go to after a movie. But only if you're a smoker....Par is a smoking bar. And even if there's no one smoking in the bar, the walls and furniture are still going to make sure you leave the bar smelling like an ash tray.  Other than the smoking aspect, Par is a pretty cool hang-out bar. The service was great. There's a long bar for you to sit and talk at. And there's several leather couches in the back that are comfortable to relax and drink on. There's also a jukebox that appeared to be pretty popular with the regulars at Par.  Another hesitation I have about Par is that there are ZERO draft beers. Everything is served in bottles. I probably won't be back to visit Par because I'm not a smoker and I really prefer draft beer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Nice servers. Bad location. Dry meats.   You order at the counter, they give you a number, you sit down.   I came for Taco Tuesday, I thought this was going to be the best part of my day! $4 off 1 dozen oysters or $2 off 1/2 a dozen. $1.50 for meat tacos. $8/3 seafood tacos.   Original charoysters ($17.95) - so much cheese! I liked this. The size of the oysters threw me off. Some were huge and some were the size of my thumb nail. Guess it evens out?   Raw oysters ($7.95/half dozen)  Grilled mahi-mahi - wow. DRY! It came with some type of sauce, jicama, cotija cheese, and some other stuff. I only ate a few pieces of fish off this. So I can't tell you if all the toppings and sauce went well with it. My boyfriend did and he couldn't get over how dry the fish was.   Grilled Baja shrimp - topped with the same stuff as the mahi mahi. I think that I'm not a fan of cotija cheese or some other topping on the tacos. Because I wanted to spit this out.   Barbacao - no flavor and extremely dry.   Carne asada - slightly flavorful and extremely dry.   Pork cracklings with red salsa - extremely dry, but the salsa kinda helped. Not crunchy or crackling-ly.   They shouldn't use large tortillas if they're not going to even cover a quarter of it. Use smaller tortillas! The ratio is just wrong.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

It's raining, so we will wait and stare at the high school girls who choose who sits and who waits.  Waiter was great and the food was great but the need to have to go at it with the manager 2x to sit at an open table makes it overall just ok.

"So I ended up stopping here on an afternoon expecting great coffee.  But the coffee was not what it should be, in respect to all the hype. I ordered a coffee to go (they also only had one coffee on and one size) and it was actually one of the poorer coffees that I've tried yet in Philadelphia.   It had a strange chemical like flavor, lacked a fresh aroma,  lacked any seriously interesting overtones, and tasted burnt.   I did not care for the cafe atmosphere itself either. It was elegantly decorated, but It didn't feel relaxing or down to earth. It just seemed pretentious.  I would personally recommend Walnut Bridge Cafe, Spruce St. Espresso, Earth Cup, etc. over La Colombe.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Came here on a recommendation of a friend. The wine selection was pretty bad. Navigated around the menu and all were pretty cheap (quality not price).  First came the garlic bread. The waitress said it was  ""complementary"", however I cannot think of anything nice to say about it at all. In fact I'm highly suspicious of whether it was really even bread? I believe it was just some really big croutons that put on some butter and were masquerading as bread. I was not fooled!   The salad was bad as well. Huge chunks of romain with a very lemony Italian dressing haphazardly splashed on the plate in a way that was drowning one half of the salad and non-existent on the rest.   For dinner, we selected the grouper with Ocean sauce. This was actually quite good. Unfortunately, the wine, crouton-bread, salad and service were a little too much for that tasty, yet outmatched, fish to overcome.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Wanted to try this little almost hidden spot in a strip mall off of 96th st for their breakfast & tacos, since that is the name. When my boyfriend and I came here around 11ish on a Saturday, there was only one other table being served so we were prompted to sit wherever we want. I ordered the 2 breakfast tacos with grilled chicken. This came with a side of hash browns. The chicken had good seasoning when I had just the chicken in a bite, but if there were other stuff it got kind of lost. The cheese in the tacos was really good, but there wasn't enough of it. The tacos honestly weren't amazing or anything and if I were to come back I'd probably get them with sausage or bacon. The hash browns weren't very warm and I needed to add salt and pepper to them. Overall, not very impressed but I'd still give it another shot.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Really disappointing the last few times. Meat is never cooked the way it should be (however you order it) and the food just is not what it should be.  The staff for the most part is great and the wine list is decent as well but the food itself has gone down hill and the consistency is just not what other places have to offer. The GM who came from another place is great and I know is trying hard, but the steak needs to be kicked up a notch.  I went there for lunch recently and had the ""business man"" lunch with a filet, salad, and the vegetables. The most important part of the meal (the meat) came out so well done that it was terrible.  There are other steak places that in this town that offer prime beef and always consistent... just drive up Campbell a few miles and you will find it.  Bottom line if you are looking for atmosphere that is jumping with some good looking people go to Sullivans. If you are looking for the best steak in Tucson go elsewhere.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"My quest for Indy's best tacos takes me to the place that's all the rage, Indy Tacos. With a name like Indy Tacos, I suppose you know what you are getting yourself into. The location certainly takes me out of my Carmel comfort zone.  My partner and I ordered 4 tacos (together, not each. That would be considered obesity to many). I got the fish and the carne asada (steak). The fish was a REEL CATCH. No, really. It was super tasty. I don't know what the fish is and I sure know it's not fresh. But the mixture of the lightly breaded shrimp with the slaw on top was super flavorful. This isn't a San Diego fish taco - this is a street fish taco. The steak taco was fine and the salsa was a helpful addition. I went with the green as red generally scares me. As a read head, you've got to know when there is too much of a good thing so I steer clear of red food. He got the mango chicken and while I don't recall his specific sentiment, but I don't remember medically induced vomit or an impromptu quinceanera so we will assume it was average.   The staff are awesome, plenty of parking, and Jarritos for all (assuming you pay, which they most certainly encourage).   Best so far in Indy if you count legit, real-deal Mexican taqueria (which rules out Bakersfield).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I love supporting local - but honestly, this was ridiculous.  Ordered 7 breakfast sandwiches all with bacon, one breakfast burrito, and 4 cinnamon rolls.  Along with drinks - after ordering the burrito, we are told that the price of the burrito is actually higher than on the menu and he (I'm assuming owner?) proceeds to pencil through price and raise it a dollar.  Mind you, it's not about the money because with tip we spent over $85 - but wouldn't you honor the price then adjust for the next person that orders?  Ok whatever - he ends up taking over the order from the original gal that was helping us, gets all flustered because our order is so big and he's had to have us repeat it multiple times to ring it up, then proceeds to yell at the original gal that from now on, only one person will take the order - he took over and got in the middle of it and yells at them?  Seriously?  Oh and that's not the end of it.  While we wait for our food after we have paid - the customer behind us places a decent size order of pasteries, etc.  Right after she leaves, we are told that they ran out of cinnamon rolls?!?!?  We are confused because there were 4 in the display, but now there aren't any because they sold and gave the cinnamon rolls we ordered and paid for to the customer behind us!!!!  They offered other pastries (which we declined and asked for a refund for them) and threw in a marmalade pastry but at this point, we have decided that we won't be returning and very disappointed in the entire experience.  Oh, but wait - we get to our place with the food and 2 of our bacon, egg sandwiches and our bacon burrito contains NO BACON!!!  You can't make this stuff up...  if we weren't so hungry, it would have been comical.  Needless to say, we won't be supporting this local establishment again.

"Let me just start this review by saying I am a Mexican food junkie.  When I moved to EPX last year, I had to try El Zarape.  It's now one of my go-to take out places.  It has cheap, fast, and delicious food.  My boyfriend and I usually get the Tosadas de Tinga with a side of chips and bean dip and it is enough for the two of us.  With a cost of about $8, the price is right.  The tostadas are so good- with nice and spicy pulled chicken with lots of lettuce and mexican cheese ontop.  One of the other reviewers said it is inconsistent-- I agree 100% although I have never had a bad experience.  Sometimes they'll charge different prices for things, sometimes you'll get something different than what you order, sometimes you'll get a double order of something... yes all those things have happened to us.  Mainly it's due to the language barrier.  But overall I would recommend this place- especially if you like good authentic Mexican food and you don't get bent out of shape if your order is a teensy bit wrong :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I have been to this location twice now, and both times it was disappointing. Tonight I got there at 7:30, and the people working behind the counters were busy closing down. They had not much out that looked fresh. There was only a few leg pieces of fried chicken left, and they had moved them from the normal spot and shut down the chicken area already.   One of the reasons I went there was for the ribs I had seen on their ads. Well that special was over last week I guess, since there were no ribs at all. One of the other things I like at this place is their pot roast. The pot roast here was more fat than meat, and was not cooked with the vegetables, so the flavor just wasn't there.   Since there were no ribs I tried to get a steak. It took two minutes to get someone to get me a piece of steak. They would not grill a fresh steak, since they had shut the grill down. They did this before 8 pm, and the restaurant is open until 10 pm.   I was not able to eat the salad I made, because someone had put blue cheese into the ranch dressing. I heard several people complain about this, but nothing was done to fix the issue.   The staff of a restaurant can make or break a place, and the staff at this store is working to get their store shut down.  They need to fire most of the crew.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Flames indian grill is located in south tampa off macdill and has a small parking lot that fills up during the dinner hour. Street parking in this area is extremely difficult as it is not allowed or residential only everywhere near this restaurant. After circling the neighborhood for street parking and not finding anything, we came around to the parking lot and finally caught someone as they were leaving... very slowly... in a mini van....   Upon entering, we were offered mukhwas, which is a colorful Indian snack with fennel seeds, anise seeds, coconut, and sesame seeds, at the front concierge and immediately noticed that Flames India grill's tables are packed way too close together for comfort. The restaurants music was playing way too faintly and was barely audible so it really didn't create a lively atmosphere. Combining the faint sound level of the music with the table proximity, we could hear all our neighbors conversations, which was not desired.   We ordered 4 dishes prepared indian hot and 2 out of 4 dishes were not spicy at all and were just too sweet. I would think the spiciness would be consistent across multiple dishes but sadly that is not the case at this restaurant. We ordered butter chicken, chicken curry, dahl makahni, spinach Dahl, and garlic nann. The butter chicken and regular Dahl wasn't spicy while the chicken curry and the Dahl makahni was spicy. I liked the spicy dishes but not the ones that were not spicy at all, as they were too sweet. We added some spice to  inedible bland dishes at home to fix the lack of spice. Was adding the same amount of spices to each dish so hard ? For better Indian food with more personal dining space, I recommend Bollywood in Clearwater or Curry Leaves off Kennedy over this place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"What a disappointment.  We arrived at 5:30 (there were only 3 tables filled) and did not finish until 7:00; and that's not because we were enjoying our food. It took 20 minutes for my salad to arrive, and after another 10 minutes, my friend had to ask the waiter for her cold fruit soup -- which he scooped from the refrigerator near our table. The soup, which had been forgotten, was basically a regular fruit smoothie in a bowl.   Then we waited another 20 minutes or so for our entrees. Place was still not that crowded. Friend had grilled shrimp -- they were lukewarm with basic fruit salsa seasoning. My meal was awful. I ordered the duck breast medium rare as suggested by the waiter. Meat was lukewarm and cooked medium. When asked, the waiter offered to take the meat and heat it up. Meat comes back to the table medium well and very dry. Waiter graciously takes it back and has chef prepare new piece of meat. Again, medium and dry. By this point I am am ravenous, so I decide to eat it. The waiter was very gracious and did offer to get another dish when I told him that the meat was just ""good"" but again dry and medium. I declined his offer. Lastly, the waiter did take the soup ($8) off our final bill, which was a thoughtful touch.  And, did I mention that the place had a mild odor of bleach/cleaning solution throughout the meal? We sat near the open kitchen but could not figure out where the smell was emanating from. It was awful.  Finally, the place is incredibly noisy.

"the pizza would probably taste better knowing the staff wore gloves when they made it, but since they don't, I can't physically think about it in the typically appetizing way.   On the subject of the staff, they're not particularly friendly, either. They told us ""they needed about twenty minutes"" to make our pizza, which was fine, but that twenty minutes was spent barking orders at the kid that works there that barely speaks English while they took breaks from fighting with each other and being rude to other customers. I heard the woman who works there tell someone on the phone ""I guess you can do that, but I wouldn't recommend it,"" and when a woman came in to get her order, the guy I assume owns it told her ""I need another ten minutes"" before then telling her ""I told whoever I talked to on the phone I'd need at least 25-30 minutes.""   If not for the absence of gloves, I probably wouldn't pay much mind to their attitudes because the rest of the place seemed pretty clean and I know how stupid customers can be, but I go out for pizza every Thursday and never come across someone who tells their customers ""I need _________ minutes."" I don't tell people at my job to give me a minute or that I need a minute to do what they're asking me to do because I don't feel like I have the right to talk to a stranger that way.

We walked in and was promptly met with a welcoming staff member advising us to sit wherever we liked. We picked up seats at the bar and were quickly given menus. Good selection of beers and drinks. We both got Dr. Tan Burger with fried egg on top. One side of Cajun tater tots and the regular fries. I have to say I really enjoyed the Cajun tater tots the best, they are spicy but sweet at the same time :)  The burgers were cooked to perfection, you could tell it's not a frozen patty. All the components of the burger worked in harmony together. The service was amazing,  despite it being the end of the night. One of the part owners, and Chef Nguygen, was chatting us up about the restaurant and the rest of the crew was just as friendly and welcoming. They offered us a taste at their meat pies ( on the starter menu) and one of their very hot hot wings. Both were very flavorful and something I look forward to ordering in the future.

Puerco Uruapan is an awesome dish and is composed of chunks of shredded pork cooked with corn, onions, jalapenos, and butter beans.  It is served with roasted potatoes which are red with achiote, and whole beans sprinkled with cotija cheese.  Don't be surprised to see the owner, Javier, talking to his customers!  It is a very friendly place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

This was not the experience I was expecting when driving all the way from South Carolina and wanting to experience the st. Louis BBQ. The host was friendly but the services sucks!! We sat down and about 20min later we got our drink orders. Then 15min later we order some app the dry rub wings (best part of our dinner). It was went down hill after that....Our drinks was never refilled until we were done with our dinner. So our empty cups just sat there the entire dinner. We asked for a refill but never got it until we asked for our check. Anyway we ordered the dry rub wings which was delicious and our dinner was 2 full slab of ribs . napkins were given or any kind of eating Utensils). AfterAfter eating the wing our fingers were a little messy so we asked for some napkins. (No we got our food we ask for utensils. The Ribs was ok but the mac and cheese was very good. There were four of us and we told our waitress that we were splitting the meal. Once the food came we never got the extra plate that we ask for. We asked a second time and it never came so with took our dirty dry rub wing plate and cleaned up so we could use it. I probably wont be back but hopefully your waitress was better then mine.

"I am always searching for a great hamburger in franklin/nashville area. When I heard flip burger was coming to nashville I anxiously awaited while it was built, checking with my friends in Atlanta who worked at flip there about the status, etc.. Total freak about it.  When it opened I couldn't wait to try it. I had heard such great things from my friends in Atlanta and the pictures looked awesome.  My husband and I finally went and I got the southern burger with fries and a captain crunch milkshake.  1. The burger was so unique and delicious. (Not 'delish' but delicious) It was deep fried, topped with pimento cheese and bread and butter pickles. O.M.G. The deep fried crispies around the patty, aka breading, was very tasty.  2. Fries are NOT included which is stupid but after I finished by burger I didn't even want them.. Which was also a waste of 3 bucks. Boooooo.  3. The milkshake was a disappointment. There was zero nitrogen in it, no foggy awesomeness I had seen in pictures and mine was spilling over the glass when the waitress brought it to my table that she had to go get napkins to clean the glass. It was VERY thin. Not milkshake like at all. And it was a lot smaller than I had anticipated. Just so-so. I was super pumped about the nitrogen shakes too. Sucks. :-(   All in all, I had a good first experience. The staff was super friendly and my burger was awesome. If I can convince my husband to go again, we won't get shakes and fries. Our burger dinner was 50 bucks. Ouch.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I had the General Tso's chicken medium hot and it wasn't remotely spicy and honestly looked and tasted like it was seasoned with red hots. Seriously.

Food was missing so much this day.  Fries over salted.  Lamb had no seasoning.  Scallops were decent but definitely light service size with only two (should at least have 3-4).  Shrimp and grits were decent but not worthy of a premier restaurant.  Scallops were the best out of the items.  Fresh black pepper on items would be welcome addition.     I'm not one to send food back or complain.  This is one of the over rated restaurants in NOLA and I have been to many.  Can't recommend this place at all.

"Yipes. I really want to like this place for dinner. After all,good pizza, good service, good food, BYOB, entertainment by a clarinet /bass duo, but I think they believe that customers will come and wait 45 minutes after reservation time, in a very hot, tiny waiting area and by overbooking,all will be fine for them.  Well it isn't, as there are other places in town. I gave no problem with a 15 minute wait, but beyond that means overbooking, and disrespect. Other restaurants do 30-45 minutes segments, ok. I can accept that. To make matters worse, the place is very very warm and without a door opened even the old of winter isn't good enough to cool off place.  After a 45 minute wait,a friend of the owner took our table for 4 and we were placed in a small booth where groups of 2 were seated.  After realizing that we waited 45 minutes for a table for four, being seated on comfortably at a Booth meant for two, we got up and left and went to dolce carini.

"Friendly efficient waiters.  Cozy hole in the wall atmosphere.  Great small menu.  And good food.  One of the best restaurants I have eaten at in Philadelphia.  We left comfortably full but not bursting at the waist.  This was not a heavy sauce kind of Italian meal.  It was very fresh and light food.  And though I am not a tiramisu fan, I wanted dessert so tried it and it was fantastic.  Not too sweet or soggy.  Really the best I have had and makes me rethink tiramisu all together.    The down side is we made reservations for 9:30 and still had to wait 15 min or so for a table when we arrived.  But I didn't mind.  It was fun being forced to stand next to the open kitchen and watch the cook and listen to him and the waitstaff banter in Italian.  Also had: Asparagus wrapped in proscutto with shrimp appetizer - Shrimp were perfectly cooked, such tender asparagus, and had the salty tender meat, with a great balsamic sauce.    I had papperdelle with radicchio, fennel, asparagus and gold raisins.  It was a great bitter dish with a hint of sweet. The pasta was homemade, a little too thick for my taste, but good none the less.

"I have eaten at Temaki Sushi quite a few times and I have never had an issue until last night.   Last night a friend of mine and I went out to dinner around 7pm. I should have known from the moment we walked through the door that it was going to be an issue. Instead of seating us right away, the woman at the front took a phone order. It didn't take long, but I thought it was rude. When we finally did get seated, it took the waitress a long time to actually come take our order. She was absorbed with the only other party in the restaurant.   I ordered an appetizer (Harumaki) with avocado and shrimp and some dipping sauces. The appetizer was good, but the dipping sauces were smears on the plate. There was no dipping involved.   I ordered a Salmon Avocado roll & a Philadelphia Roll. When the rolls arrived, the avocado was rotten; it was brown and it had the veins running through it. I love avocados. I would eat them every day if I could. The last time I ate an avocado that looked like the one rolled into my sushi, I swore off avocados for 6 months. I told the waitress it was rotten right after she set the plate down. She had them make me a new one and the second one was filled with rotten avocado, too. The manager came over and asked me what was going on. I showed her the roll and she said avocados turn brown when the pit is removed. I explained to her that I understood the oxidation process, but once the veins are visible it's rotten. She apologized, took it off my bill, and gave us a discount. I appreciated that.   My main issue is the food prep. If the manager (?) didn't know the avocado was rotten the sushi chef did, but he put it in my roll anyway. It wasn't until I sent the second roll back that he went in the back and got another avocado. Also worth noting: when I walked in the door, a girl I knew was picking up a sushi platter. Her rolls were wrapped in bright green avocado. The avocado in my appetizer was also bright green. If he served a fresh avocado to the woman who got the platter and it was in my app, why wasn't I served fresh avocado in my roll?   I would go back to Temaki. Like I said, this is the first bad experience I have had there. It just seems like there are a lot of changes going on in there (i.e increased prices and diminishing quality). I may have just caught them on a bad night.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

This place needs a SERIOUS update. I honestly feel so gross every time I come here. We still go back a lot because my husband doesn't mind that the place is so old and dirty because he loves Hibachi. And we also continue to go because there isn't that many options for good Hibachi in the city.  Most days the Hibachi food itself is good. But at other times the chicken is rubbery to the point I can't eat it. I really think this place especially for the price should be renovated and the restaurant needs to be cleaned.

"Decent American-style Chinese/Polynesian food sadly disappeared in Pinellas County for many years.  So sad??  We were left to just suffer and endure strip-mall, carbon-copy, ""Chinese"" take out.  You know the kind.  They popped up like culinary weeds, all over Pinellas county and elsewhere.  Sure, those may get a dish or two right, but overall are mostly depressing.  The fried rice is yellow(??), the meats are of gristle-substandard quality, all fried stuff has a ""bad-oil"" taste, and the sauce flavors are minimal, at best:  sweet, hot, or just cheap-soy-sauce-flavored??  Then by accident, I discovered ZOM HEE.  Wow!!  My friends and I all agree, walking into the place is almost like a minor time-warp.  Back to the days when water chestnuts and pineapple were considered ""exotic.""  When you enter, it almost feels like walking into a missing scene from a Tarantino film?  You will never understand this unless you visit in person, so I will not expand further, nor spoil the surprise.  Just GO!  And please don't let the ""retro"" pedigree fool you...  ZOM HEE makes some seriously tasty and affordable food!  Cocktail fans should definitely visit the bar!  Very inexpensive and potent retro/tiki drink concoctions, some even served in vintage ""Tiki"" mugs!  My friend swears by the ""Tahitian Scorpion!""  I really enjoy their ""St. Pete Sling.""   As for the food?  A great way to set a baseline here is to just sample the won ton soup, egg rolls, and fried rice.  ALL are top-notch!  Actual BROWN fried rice?  Wow!!  Flavored with REAL soy sauce?  Just how long since it's been you've enjoyed that?  Zom Hee has a large and expansive menu.  I have sampled almost everything now, over the years.  Nothing has ever disappointed...  My menu favorites?  The ""Woo Hip Har"" is a simple, but magical shrimp dish.  The ""Woo Shu"" chicken is also a must-have.  The ""Mandarin Pork"" is also very good, but request mild or you will definitely feel the heat!  As for the service?  Family-owned, you will be treated like family too - Kenny, Dave, and the whole crew are awesome!  I have been going here enough that they now know me by name, even when I just simply phone in a simple take-out order?  Nice...  To conclude, if you want to experience the BEST in American-style Chinese/Polynesian food, drinks, and decor...  A ZOM HEE visit is a MUST !!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I love outback. I always feel their food is quality and some of the subtle details they add to each menu item just makes me very happy at times. I've transitioned my diet drastically over the past 10 years where now I am a pescatarian. However, I only eat ""certain"" fishes now and no other seafood like shrimp, lobster, etc. overall, my diet is tricky and picky yet and still through the years, outback has remained one of my favs so when my mom offered to take me there last night, I was so excited.   1) We sat at the bar bc we were on a time crunch and it was a little crowded in the lobby area with an estimated 20 min wait. The bar lady took forever and a day ... ok maybe 12 minutes to give us a menu. the lobby was busy but the bar was not btw.  I actually had to ask her for one after the unjustified and extremely noticeable wait.   2) A very rude lady reached over my bread with the sleeve of her coat just missing it to grab a drink menu that was behind the bar counter. I told this witch that I could have easily handed it to her instead of her squeezing and maneuvering so much to reach so far. what is wrong with ppl and keeping comfortable distances ESPECIALLY when one's food is involved? It was so much for her too like she was on her tip toes trying to get to that menu when I'm right there and could easily have gotten it for her. ughhhhh. I was annoyed and she seemed even more bothered that I pointed this out that ummmmm excuse you but I could have handed that to you!!!   3) #2 above is not really outback's fault I guess. the reason she probably felt the need to be so extra and take matters into her own hands was bc of probably a similar experience with my #1 (extra long wait for service). however, #2 is probably why I was feeling a little agitated at this point so now I'm paying attn to everything more than normal which leads me to my final issue. I watched in horror the server bring out 2 plates of food uncovered, without a tray, through a crowd of ppl who were in her path that she had to squeeze through to get by. She was short and had to maneuver her way through the many deaf ears when she said excuse me.  Like I said, she was short so I watched the plates of food in her hands basically inadvertently touch the end tips of a pony tail of some lady whose back was facing her. both completely oblivious to what these poor plates of food to be eaten are going through. I watched in disbelief and shook my head as she walked passed us thanking God she didn't stop at us .... until she turned around and walked back to us happy and bubbly unbeknownst to any of what I just stated, and said ""hehe I gotta learn the bar numbers"" like walking past us was the only mistake she made with our food.  I couldn't even begin to explain this to anyone there like management or whatever so I just nibbled and picked at my food, paid and left. figured for my level of frustration at the time, I could better convey my experience here on Yelp.   lesson of the day: look up a creative recipe and cook a restaurant type of meal @home!!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"We have been twice and both time the service was borderline terrible and the food marginal at best. Yes, we know that there are 130 beers on tap, but to only have two wines and then tell us both are in boxes. The server actually asked my wife when she asked for wine ""well, what don't you like about beer?"" It was asked in a manner that screamed how dare you ask for something other that beer.

"I was very much looking forward to visiting this restaurant after seeing the good reviews, and checking out the menu online.  I ended up having probably the most awful restaurant experience I have ever had, and as someone who eats out all the time, that is saying a lot.    I was with a group of four, and 2 of the four appetizers had hairs in them, visible before we even dug into the food.    I am a chef myself,  and didn't want to make a huge deal out of it, because I know these things can happen and we were really hungry, and once we ordered, the servers weren't really available, so we  dug in.  Our entrees arrived before the appetizer plates were cleared, which irked me but eh, what are you gonna do?  The food was pretty good, though we all thought the presentation was a bit sloppy, and some of the entree portions were quite small.  But the big problem was when we were presented with the check.  I had presented a dealyo voucher shortly after we were seated, and before we ordered.  They didn't take the $40 off the check, and I passed one of the two servers we had on my way to the ladies room and politely informed him that he hadn't deducted the voucher amount.  He said I didn't give it to him and I told him I gave it to the waitress.  He proceeded to tell me that we couldn't use the voucher because we hadn't said we were using it when we made our reservation and insisted that this was not their policy, but dealyo's, which is totally untrue.  There is absolutely nothing on the voucher that states this, only that a reservation is recommended and  to present it prior to ordering, which we did.  When I told him this he actually asked me who the hell I thought I was.  Um, a paying customer who just spent $145 in your restaurant and now feels totally ripped off?    I buy lots of restaurant vouchers and had them not honored a couple times, usually because of a change in ownership, but it's always been stated at the beginning.  That the waitress actually took my voucher and said nothing as we each ordered apps and entrees and then refused to honor it at the end of the meal makes them thieves in my book.  Then being yelled at by the other waiter was just beyond unacceptable.    And I am still stuck on their reaction to the hair in the food.  Any decent establishment would have offered a free dessert or something, or at least expressed some concern and APOLOGIZED.  I have been in this business for 30 years, and I know, these things happen, but you make an effort to make it right for your guests.  There is no way anyone should frequent this place, even if they had the best food in the world.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Bru Burger has a solid thing going on, but to me it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I may be spoiled from great burger places up in Chicago, but my experience didn't meet the hype I've heard about Bru.  There was a wait on a Wednesday at 6:30, which was surprising to me, but of course Mass Ave is a great place for dinner/drinks after work. It took a little while for the waitress to come over, but when she did, we were able to get some basic info about the menu and order our drinks. The appetizers all looked amazing - my brother and I picked out four that we could have easily devoured, but settled on the pesto, goat cheese, and sun dried tomatoes with thinly sliced bread. Yum yum!  My brother went with ""The End"" burger, and I have to admit that I had food envy. I had the ahi tuna burger, and while the tuna was ok, it wasn't anything special. The flavor was pretty traditional, and it had a breading on the outside as if the patty was supposed to be crusty, but it wasn't. I wasn't in the mood for regular fries and was disappointed when they said they didn't have sweet potato fries (doesn't everyone have those now??), but luckily, their regular fries were some of the better ones I've had. I was definitely not a fan of the house-made ketchup; it was runny yet clumpy and had very little flavor except a little bit of sweetness. I also thought it was surprising that the fries were a la carte and not included with a burger purchase.  Overall, it was an ok meal, and if I was really craving a burger while downtown, I'd consider it. There are just other restaurants that I'd want to repeat before this one.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I have never had roast squash in a pizza before, I have been missing out! Nutella tiramisu was light and oh so chocolatey. I total winner, I highly suggest you indulge yourself.

"We decided to try out this spot after eating brunch at another place and came simply to drink outside in a dog friendly atmosphere.   We were seated quickly and immediately were chomping down on homemade chips and salsa...even though we already ate we all seemed to be unable to stop eating these awesome chips n dip. After looking over the drink menu we all decided on a pitcher of El Hervidor (The Boiler) which includes tequila, Lime Juice, Refresco de Tonronja (grapefruit soda) on ice ...well let me tell you this there was NO alcohol in the damn pitcher to say the least.   We enjoyed the atmosphere and gawked over our neighbors food and decided we will come back soon to simply eat and not drink.

"I usually have a very good experience with this Taco Bell location! I feel conflicted however because I have had to return for missing ordered items or items with incorrect toppings.

"Ok place, but is not a 'go out of your way' or 'let's celebrate' kinda restaurant, which is what I normally prefer for +$60/pp.  My appetizer, jumbo lump crab, was awesome. A little on the skimpy side, regardless, the crab couldn't have been any fresher or sweeter. Her Caesar salad could have been found in Applebee's, i.e. the dressing, croutons were nothing special; did not warrant the $10 price tag.   The steak preparations were a disappointment. Both were cooked a perfect medium-rare as ordered, but both were overly seasoned with black pepper  ( if I wanted au poivre, I would have ordered it ). The risotto, while perfectly firm and creamy, was also destroyed by too much black pepper. Her mashed potatoes were on the skimpy side, looked like 2 tbsp of potatoes smeared across her plate.  Even though the dining room is small, wait staff was inattentive, e.g. water goes un-refilled, dirty plates sit on your table too long.  All in all, I know of a couple of other decent places to get a steak in SJ, I'll pass on a 2nd trip to Ralic's.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I am quite the fan of beer and of burgers.  So after reading a few reviews I figured I should check this place out.  And I'm glad I did!  I was almost overwhelmed by the beer selection.  Felt like a kid in a candy store!  I was so excited I couldn't just pick one.  Told our waitress to just start at the first beer on tap and lets work our way down...I made it through 3.  I have many, many more to go!  All 3 were great.  I just hope they don't change their drink menu or I'm never going to be able to keep track.  I had the 775 Burger and my friend had the turkey burger.  I loved my burger, everything about it was so super tasty!  My friend said the turkey burger was also very good, she got the cranberry mustard on the side, it was so good I stole it from her and used it to dip my fries in.  My only compliant about the food was the wilty piece of lettuce on my plate.  And is it really necessary to give me a slice of onion when my burger came with the most delicious onions ever on it already?  The waitress was very nice but maybe she should have came to work a few minutes early to review both the food and drink menus.  When she first came over to see if we were ready my friend told her I wanted a dirty hoe, she just stared at me like I was the biggest perv she'd ever seen.  I had to explain to her that it was a drink and what was in it and it was not only served there but at a few other places around town.  Then when it came time to order our food I asked her a question about the 775 burger.  She asked to borrow my menu, then read the description word for word to me.  Gee, thanks because I would have never thought of doing that on my own!!  Good thing she's cute!  All in all I really like this place.

"Why 5 stars? Because after one visit, this is already one of my favorite 2020 discoveries.     ---   ---   ---  I recently came across the Flan Factory when looking up new spots and new that it would not be long before I ended up stopping in. The gap between finding Flan Factory on Yelp to sitting in the dining room was about one week and it was everything I hoped it would be.  I ordered El Tampeno (their version of a Cuban) which was delicious. It was a bit lighter than your typical Cuban, which was nice. I'm not sure if it was the airy breading or the fact that it just wasn't as jam packed (maybe both?) but it was a nice lighter meal.  I also couldn't leave here without trying Timba - fried cheese with guava dipping sauce. It's as amazing as it sounds. I highly recommend it!  And I definitely had to grab a couple of flans to-go to bring home to the wife. I was planning on ordering coconut and guava, but coconut wasn't on the menu when I visited, so I went with salted caramel instead. Both were unbelievable. No wonder the name of this place is the Flan Factory - these were the definitely the highlight item, IMO!  On top of the delicious eats, the people here were incredibly nice. They also really play up the puns. They sell t-shirts that say ""Only Flans"" and when you go to tip on your credit card, 20% is labeled ""Flantastic!"" That alone is worth 5-stars, but the food matched up to the pun-itry.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Part dump, part dive, small but mighty!  I had three street tacos.  That sounded like a good number of the smaller tacos for lunch so it's what I ordered.  All came with lettuce, tomato, onion and cilantro.  I prefer four tortillas so they were all on those.  Thoughts...  Chicken Thigh Al Carbon: good enough interpretation.  Chicken was a little dry but had a nice grilled taste to it.  Pork Steak: interesting idea that packed a lot of flavor and had a nice char to further enhance the experience.  Beef Fajita: my favorite by far!  I really enjoyed the tender beef, seasoned very nicely and full of flavor.  When I was eating it I kept thinking carne asada but the menu says beef fajita.  It would have benefited from the addition of fajita-style peppers and onions but that's a minor nit-pick given how delicious the beef was in this taco.  Also of note: their salsa is clearly fresh-made in house and it shows.  Bright flavors, just a little heat and served in big bowl with a big basket of chips.  Complimentary with the tacos.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

It was good although I thought it would've been a fried chicken breast considering this was a ""gourmet burger"" spot. So the chicken patty was a fail BUT it was flavorful.

"We have been customers of The Hollywood Grill for years (7+).  We have known many of the wait staff and the past several managers and until tonight have always been treated like Kings and Queens.  Tonight we went in for an early dinner as we had just left the local park.  My wife and I ordered the Fresh Broiled Cod and a few sides.  The cod was delivered to the table along with a sweet potato and fresh steamed broccoli.  The broccoli and sweet potato were prepared to perfection, the fish however, we had a major problem.  Upon the 1st bite my wife (we had split the dish), we noticed the fish was ""slimy"" and had a foul odor (ammonia).  CLEARLY A BAD PEICE OF FISH.  We called over our waitress and we notified her of the concern and she immediately called over the manager.   He took a look and without a word he took the plates and said nothing.  Never once apologizing or anything.  A few moments later the waitress came back and said, they are taking it off the check.  I said well who inspected the fish.  We later found out it was the OWNER of the establishment who inspected the food and was told his comments were ""oh, this isn't bad, it just has a strong fish smell"".   First of all, no properly prepared fish should have a ""strong fish smell EVER!.  I prepare fish at home all time purchased from the local food markets.... 2nd, AMONIA is not a fish smell... it is a rotten smell and if you can't smell it as an owner, you have a major problem.  Besides the health risk you put in front of my wife and family tonight, you never offered an apology or even came to our table to consult with us.  You can be sure, and not because we received a bad piece of fish, these things happen, we will not be back - or at least I will not be - because your customer service and poor response to a major problem is unprofessional.  My money will better spent either at another local diner on the other side of town which by the way is less expensive and has way better quality food and top notch service or simply cooking at home.  YOU as the owner should be ashamed of the way you treat your customers - especially the ones who been your guests for years.  That ends tonight.

"Yesterday, Saturday around 5pm, my girlfriend and I planned to dine at Empire, but upon walking up to the front, the place was closed. Lights on, an employee inside, but the open sign was off and door locked. At 5 on Saturday both google and yelp shows it as open, so what gives?  The next day during the same time we decide to try again. This time they're open, but only one other patron and a cook in front occupy the restaurant. We walk in and before we decide what to get from the menu, he mentions all they have is pizza - a pepperoni and cheese pie sit in front of him. No full menu? We decided on a few slices of pepperoni to go, but we were planning on sandwiches.   After heating them up in the pizza oven he sandwiches them between two paper plates - the kind that absorb oil like a paper towel (which they did) - and puts them in a grocery bag. They were okay pizzas with a pretty rubbery crust.   Maybe we'll go again when the place is a little busier and has some more menu options, but reading other reviews, there seems to be a pretty slim chance we'll have a good experience.

"Zena's serves below  average Mediterranean food that happens to look good on the images of their takeout brochure.  There was nothing photo-worthy about the dishes, however there is a good selection on a menu that is all over the place with other foods, that is in terms of quantity not anything more.   The chicken kabob sandwich was doused with a ""garlic sauce"" yet it was sweet and very saucy, not the whipped garlic sauce we see in typical Lebanese fare, not good.  The tabouli salad had an enormous amount of wheat and lacked lemon, spices and flavor, definitely not authentic tasting.   The lentil soup was extremely watered down, oily and bland while the stuffed grape leaves had an aftertaste like they came out of a Can. The rice had no taste but that of boiled water residue and the chopped chunks of nuts  used for garnishing it couldn't save it, even if they tried!   Ended up sending back the soup, grape leaves and rice as they were inedible.  The bathroom although tidy at first glance, was very dirty when staring at the walls, floors and fixtures.   Wouldn't return ever again!  However, this location seems in a heavy residential area with not much around.

"A meditation on the Vietnamese vermicelli noodle salad bùn. I'm listening carefully to learn how to pronounce it correctly. It isn't bun as in hotdog bun and it isn't Boone as in Daniel Boone. It lies somewhere in-between. The best phonetic spelling I can come up with is bwun? If you have to - just use your hands a lot. I'm sure they're used to Americans saying bun and foe. ""I hear the foe here is pretty dang good."" All of the elements are important but let's face it, vermicelli, julienne carrot, fresh bean sprout and lettuce are not challenging ingredients. Of course, the quality and preparation of the protein is paramount if you choose to incorporate one. The addition of egg roll is critical. I order extra. I don't think bùn should be ordered without egg roll. If you don't like crispy fried egg roll in your cold noodle salad you should reevaluate your priorities and take a hard look at your life choices. What separates one bùn from another is the fish sauce, (I love them fish squeezin's.) Anchovies and maybe mackerel are salted, left to ferment and squeezed to produce the sauce. The fermentation can be as little as a month or up to two years. There are sweet and savory fish sauces. Bùn is served with sweet fish sauce. VN Pho deli & Hai's Sushi & Pho make their own from scratch. The difference is striking. I have yet to inquire about Pho Ann's or Vui's fish sauce but it is absolutely delicious as well. I still need to try Thai Phooket's and Kien Gang's bùn It's also time to order Bán Xèo. It's a savory, crispy, rice flour pancake made with tumeric, stuffed with what ever you like. They normally come with pork, shrimp, green onion and bean sprouts. Yes sir, I'll never tire of the food of Vietnam.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
I stumbled upon this place looking for something to eat in LaVergne. I was skeptical because I never heard of it. To my surprise there was a grand opening banner outside.

"We, honestly, didn't even order food. This place has been on our list of eateries to try for a while, and the happy hour reviews were strong.  So this ended up being quite the let down.   I am a celiac and eating gluten results in severe pain for me.  Consequently I have to be careful,  and very rarely do I encounter a restaurant that is unwilling to work with me.    When presented the menu, I inquired about my options and was met with a blank stare.  I don't mind if you don't know,  but it is unacceptable to not ask.  I finally suggested that she ask someone who might know.  She inquired to the other cocktail server/ bartender who seemed too busy to deal with my problem (with 1 active table).  After several interations of being told by my server that I could eat anything (which I KNOW is not true), me and my party decided to try a place that would take my well being and business more seriously...and in midtown I didn't have to look far.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Took a destination run here this past week for my first ever Ethiopian food experience. Needless to say, I was very pleased.   This place was pretty busy for a Monday night and with one waitress, the service was a bit slow.  The lady was so freaking sweet that we didn't even care.   Since this was my first exposure to such novel, tantalizing cuisine, I opted for the vegetarian combination platter to try a bit of everything ($9.50). Oh was it delicious.  I wish I could remember what everything was called slash which were which but honestly, it didn't matter because they were all so scrumptious.  The injera (which I learned means ""companion"") was also delicious (I know what you're thinking - what the hell does this girl have to compare it to? Rest assured, one of the friends in attendance said it was ""one of the freshest batches of injera"" she has ever tasted soo not totally uncorroborated).   But anyway, the atmosphere exuded a true sense of authenticity from the wall art to the deep red and faded yellow wooden fabric-coated chairs.  Although the clientele was very diverse, there was an unmistakable feeling of camaraderie throughout creating a sense of calm and comfort.   There is also a bar upstairs - apparently Monday night is music night as there were some very interesting tunes drifting from above.  Seemed like a really fun time.   Bottom line: great, reasonably priced food in an authentic, feel-good environment. Oh and the absolute amiability of the staff outshines the somewhat slow service.

Probably the worst reservation system known to man.  Its doesn't exist. You use Yelp and it tells you 60 min wait- when you arrive in 60 minutes you then you need to wait for and hour and a half additional.  YES.  2.5 HR WAIT.  UNACCEPTABLE.  Management needs to take actual reservations.  Restaurants in the world have done this for years. It works.  Try it!  Love to tell you about the food but I'm still waiting.

Usually I am very pleased with my meal. I usually go to the Draper location in Utah. Today I went to the West Jordan location. I was charged more than usual. So prices have gone up. I ordered a full rice bowl half chicken half steak. I got it and the quantity of food in there was the same as a half bowl. I mentioned it. I was told they got a new manager so the portion sizes have been reduced. What?! Okay so I pay more for less. I will never go there again. And if that manager is making bad decisions like that good luck! Normally when I go in the draper location it has plenty of customers. This location has one other customer. And then one of the employees eating decided to belch extremely loud. He thought it was comical. I thought it was disgusting. I don't recommend going to this location.

This is truly a gem on the Westside of Indianapolis within the culturally diverse International Marketplace. I stopped here for a late lunch on my day off and after contemplating the many choices offered I decided to go with the jerk chicken dinner with jollof rice and fried plantains as my sides with a delicious byssop (sweet hibiscus drink). The dining area was clean and the hostess was patient and helpful as I came to my decision. They restaurant has a lot of good options to choose from but would recommend the dinner portions if you have a bigger appetite. I took my order to go and would suggest getting the byssop w/o ice (ice will be in a separate cup) because once you take a sip of it you are gonna want all you can get. The jerk chicken was just right in terms of flavors and spice and paired very well with the rice and complemented the fried plantains.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

Tasted ok but pork is preferred here for its taste. The hot and sour soup was ok but looked pale and unappetizing not rich like it should.   Fried rice was very dry, needed some oil to help edibility. Cabbage used for the egg rolls, sesame beef and house low main was sliced too thick. Low main noodles were white and the dish looked unappetizing. Sesame beef was good. Not great but good.  If we weren't starved we may have walked away from this. Won't go back.

"A coworker recommended this place to us. I was excited for the BBQ shrimp. Anyway, the down and dirty of my experience is this.... waited over an hour for a table. Female host indicates table is ready and we get up and then the rude male host shoos off my BF like he was not welcome. Finally sit at the table and for ten minutes (at least) no welcome, no offer for water or drinks, no menus....NOTHING! NADA! The table next to us has three people seated after us and the waitress quickly takes care of them and leaves us high and dry. Me: back to the female host to inform of the feeling of being ignored. Waitress then take care of us and after ordering soup, oysters, stuffed shrimp and bbq shrimp that's about where the service ended. We never got a single refill on drinks, never were asked if we were ok and never got our oysters. We were beyond frustrated. The review that says the bbq shrimp has little flavor is about right. shrimp were way over cooked and very little flavor. I know what N'awlins bbq shrimp is supposed to taste like...

"Mama Rosa must be rolling over in her grave. This place makes pizza with a conveyor belt. Any pizza place with a conveyor belt does not deserve to be in business. In fact, Mayor Bob Buckhorn should propose a city ordinance outlawing being within six feet of a conveyor belt pizza place. So many New Yorkers down here, I find it hard to believe a pizza place on 7th Ave in Ybor wouldn't use a real pizza oven. I think it demonstrates how much they really value their business; pizza ovens are an expensive, but necessary, investment.  Anyway, to the pizza. It was cold. It was actually cold. He did heat it up, but the inside was still cold. And it was floppy. Good pizza has a slightly crispy crust. Just crispy enough to maintain its integrity. Just crispy enough there's a little crunch when you bite in. This pizza had none of that. It was a big ball of sloppy grease.  Furthermore, the slices were expensive.

I wish I would have done more research before going in.  I knew it was a BYOB but we forgot to bring any wine... I feel like small BYOBs should still have a better selection of beverages to serve the customers. How hard is it to make some iced tea and not have a $4 soda?  I ordered the Crispy Duck Breast which tasted fine but there was nothing ""crispy"" about it.   My boyfriend had ordered some sort of fish dish. I want to say it was sea bass. The fish came in a shallow bowl with a wild rice. I have to say his portion size was horrible compared to my dish which took up the all the room on my plate.  We will never return to eat here.

I wish they expanded their menu to have some vermicelli and broken rice dishes, but maybe eventually they will.

Why bother branding a stale burger bun? At least toast the whole thing so it doesn't taste 2 weeks old.

"Villa Peru had long been on my list of places to try.  I know the space really well from the previous restaurant. So, I opted for take out, because it's a little too snug for indoor dining for my comfort level.   I placed my order online on a Saturday evening for a 6:30pm pick up. When I arrived to pick up, the order had not been started. According to the hostess, they stop accepting online orders after 6pm. Two issues with this:  1. I placed the order at 5:45ish pm 2. It is not stated anywhere on their website that they stop taking online orders at 6pm. In fact, they should not only state that somewhere but also turn online ordering off. That's honestly really bad for business.  Additionally, the hostess said it would be 15 minutes, which ended up being closer to 40 minutes.   The place was packed. I'm torn about this rating. The food was simple and uniquely flavored. I ordered the half chicken, quinoa salad and the salpicon de pollo. The chicken was on the salty side for my taste.

I immediately liked the quaint ambiance but unfortunately, it was better than the food.  The host was disinterested and unfriendly upon walking in the door (never a good sign).  Although very minor, our candle was never lit but I noticed all other diners had theirs lit and the lighting was quite dim.  It took awhile to receive our bread and I had to ask for it once they brought out my soup.  I ordered the Mushroom Soup, which was a disappointment.  Not very flavorful.  I was informed ahead of time that it was not a cream based soup but a broth, which made me slightly hesitant to try it but decided to go for it.  Probably won't do that again!  I was hoping my entree would be better.  I ordered the Sicilian Sauteed Calamari, which sounded interesting.  When it was placed in front of me, I was shocked at how small of a portion I was served.  Good thing I had asked for the bread!  A lot of different flavors going on in the dish, with a surprise spicy kick.  Jalapeno peppers, perhaps?  I do not handle spicy food too well so I wish that I had known upon ordering but it didn't mention it on the menu and I didn't think to ask.  I didn't hate it but I didn't love it, either.

"Ms T joined Mr D and me for Barbecue Wednesday, this time on a Thursday, due to Capitalist Pig's hours.  Mr D and I had been here once before only to find out that they are not open on Wednesday.  Note to self; call ahead, especially for barbecue joints.  We made a pretty good run at the menu as is our norm.  I want to be able to judge a range of what they do with regard to the meats.  Ms T went for a pulled pork sandwich, Mr D had a half slab and I ordered a dinner plate of half brisket and half smoked corned beef as well as a bare half rack.   Pulled Pork - the broken record get's played again.  Ms T and I agreed (we occasionally do) that this was not very good pulled pork.  It really had very little flavor at all.  It was dryish, not smoky, unsalted and showed no real evidence of having a rub.  If there is a purpose for having barbecue sauce, this would be it.  1 to 1-1/2.  Ribs- CP serves back ribs.  On the plus side, they were well cooked.  That means they were done, tender, juicy.  They were not chewy or on the other extreme, mushy.  The negative is that they were not smoky in a good way, regardless of being quite darkly blackened and they also had no salt.  I don't know how to say this, but again, Ms T and I agreed (mark your calendars) that they tasted weirdly fishy.  What is that?  I really think they are using the wrong wood or cooking too hot or starving the fire of oxygen.  As I said they were not smoky in a good way.  But really, give them credit for being properly done.  Now add a better rub that includes the proper level of salt and the smoke/fishy thing would probably fade into the background.  My ribs at home used to be black like this until I figured out that I really did not know the temperature of my smoker.  Mr D's ribs were even blacker than mine.  I fixed that issue at home and now they are a beautiful mahogany color.  1-1/2 to 2 star ribs.  Brisket - I had both regular smoked brisket and smoked corned beef brisket.  The common theme here with the regular brisket is again, no salt.  It was decent, maybe a little dry, but not bad and not overly lean.  It does not come up to the standard currently being set by Salt + Smoke.  Improve the rub and this is pretty good.  2-1/2 star brisket.  The best thing I had was the Smoked corned beef.  I am just guessing here, but I think they smoked it, then braised it.  It was very moist, dead tender and very flavorful.  As you would expect, being corned beef, it did not lack salt.  We all liked it the best.  Easy 4 stars.  We did not sample the Amish Chicken, but the photo looked wonderful.  I may go back for the smoked corned beef and to try the chicken.  As to sides - Potato salad was the clear winner.  It is chunky with a creamy mayo and dill dressing and the potatoes were cooked done.  I have been getting a lot of undercooked potato salad lately.  The slaw (unlike one yelp photo) is now finely ground, which I like, but almost totally undresssed.  I doused it with pepper vinegar that was on the table and added (yes, same theme) salt.  Don't bother with this slaw.  None of us cared for the baked beans.  They are tangy, missing something to round them out.  They need a little salt.  They are dominated by a very dark almost bitter, molasses or caramelized sugar flavor, but are not really sweet.  They are close to having good ribs and brisket if they can improve their rub.  The smoked corned beef is excellent as is the potato salad.  I still want to try the chicken.  The pulled pork is forgettable.  Overall, this is the best 2 star barbecue I have had but still no better than 2 stars.  It would be so easy to fix.  The judgement was unanimous.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Nashville has so many bad places to eat.  Hillbilly food and it does not matter what you order everything comes with gravy.  So eating here was quite a surprise since the menu was not loaded with starches or greasy entrees.  1808 Grill was a nice setting, polished and quiet.  Could be a nice place to eat in any major city.  Menu was quite a change from the typical Nashville restaurant.  High on proteins and vegetables and low on carbs as the centerpiece.   Our only complaint pertained to the side dishes which lacked any flavor.  In my case it was the cooked mushrooms.  Good quality but zero flavor. I hope they make it!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Nice space, convenient parking, lively vibe. Lots of tasty spices in the food. Our server was good. He answered our questions and made sure we were doing well.  Okay, got the positive stuff out of the way. Now for the not-so-positive stuff...  When we checked in at the front, we told the host we had a reservation. He turned to his computer, found our name, and handed menus to the person seating us. He never said another word. Spooky.  We ordered the queso. It was a soup bowl half full of melted gouda poured over a mixture of spices. It was served with a bowl of chips. Well, actually, I should be specific - it was served with a bowl of tortilla chip pieces. You know, those little pieces you find at the bottom of the chip bag when your roommate hits the bag first? Yeah, those chips. Try picking up thick gouda with a handful of chip crumbs.  My wife was leery of the individual tacos, so she went with the steak fajitas. They were very tasty, and the meat was cooked well. But man, at $25, they should be. And the fajita bowl full of chopped jalapenos was a bit of a surprise, although thankfully, they had been seeded first. The sides with the fajitas were also good.  I got the pork belly bolsa. The waiter explains bolsa means ""pocket. And I literally could've stuck this bolsa in my pocket. It will easily fit in the palm of your hand. Almost comically tiny. Not my hand, the bolsa. Very tasty, but seriously small. I know, it was just $5, but c'mon... You'd need 5 of these to make a dinner for an adult.  Then the tacos. I only tried the City Market Pastor taco. The waiter told me it was a 3"" taco, but believe me, that's being generous. The tortilla may be 3"", but the meat portion left plenty room on that tortilla. Looking forlorn, the meat had a taste more reminiscent of finely chopped chorizo. Nothing on the plate but this smurf-sized taco. I know, only $3.75, but you'd need 6 of these things to make a decent dinner.  For some reason, they decided margaritas needed to be given the Nada treatment, too. So, instead of that nice fruity triple sec taste, or a great orange-y taste of Grand Marnier, you get something called ""homemade curacao"". Which basically smells/tastes like a perfumey flower. TIP: Ask them for a regular margarita and substitute Grand Marnier for the ""homemade curacao"" and they'll simply get you a ""nadarita"" and put a drop of Grand Marnier on top for an extra $2.  Overall, we found the place to be okay. But given the prices, I have to say nope. Our quest for tremendous gourmet Mexican/Southwest food continues.  TIP: Valet park at the Kimpton Aertson Midtown hotel around the corner from the restaurant on Broadway. $3 and the service there was great! The Host at Nada will wordlessly validate the parking ticket for you while he talks to one of the waitresses.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Pizza was just ok. Way too expensive for ""ok"" pizza. Music was blaring so loud that the poor cashier couldn't even hear me. She said it is like that everyday. She was a sweetheart. My complaint about her was that she was sweeping the floors when I came in and than grabbed my pizza without washing her hands! Now Everytime I touch the box or sit on my counter I have to scrub my hands. No telling what floor germs that I'm spreading on my counter. Going to empty box and put it on one big platter. Not sure if I will be back. I ordered the Hotbox pizza and it was kind of bland. I might venture out and try another specialty to give them another chance.  I just don't see anything special about them but maybe they will grow on me. I have had much better pizza elsewhere.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"The people that wrote good reviews must not know good food or restaurants. No one should EVER go to this restaurant unless dragged there.  The food isn't good (been more than once to give it another try), the service isn't good, and they overbook every single table.    If you think you have a reservation, think again.  We waited an hour and a half to be seated for a birthday reservation, and all they could tell us was, your table will be ready in 15 minutes!  No apologies and no compensation offered.    I asked to speak to the manager and before I could even get a full sentence out he cut me off to say, ok dessert is in us.  Really buddy?  You are going to give us dessert, which we may not even want, for an hr and a half wait for a reservation.  Time is money and this place sucks.

"As a southern girl I had to try out Barnyard. First the good. It's interior is adorable. Very quaint and down home feel. Drinks in Mason jars. Sweet tea is great. The waitress was attentive and introduced the menu to us. The food overall was good. The main entrees are massive. Be prepared to get a box.  Now the bad. It's new and they have some kinks to work out. Granted we got there an hour and a half before closing. There was nobody in there which made me a bit nervous. We ordered the brick fries for an appetizers, which are huge. But we never got to eat them because the food came 2 minutes later. So we had to box up the app and barely got a chance to eat it before it cooled off. I ordered the open face turkey sandwich. The flavor of the turkey was great. But the gravy was incredibly peppery so that it took away from the turkey. The mashed potatoes were also a little cold. My fiancé has the bbq po boy and loved it. He loved it.

"I had never heard of this place until my wife took me here for my birthday.  The last time she had been here ws 40 years ago, and it was considered to be one of the fancy-schmancy places to eat in New Orleans.  The food was well-prepared standard fare, though the veal was over-breaded and overcooked.  The fish was lightly-breaded and prepared well.  There is a complete menu slection, including appetizers, salads, meats and sefooods.  The setting is a kitchy-elegant with Caribbean-themed carpet, furniture and drapes with cystal chandeliers.  The service was attentive and informed, but inexperienced.  The clientele I would decribe as well-heeled, old-money locals, conservative.   Men are required to wear a suit or jacket.  Caters to small groups with accommodations for larger groups.  We finished the evening off in the rooftop ""Hot Tin Roof""bar that had students and young couples.  This rooftop bar has a superb view of the New Orleans nightime skyline.  The Caribbean Rom is on the ground floor of the Ponchartrain Hotel, a boutique hotel along St. Charles Avenue outside of the central business district.  I would reommned this place as a quirky experience to break your routine.  I think it would be a good date-night establishment, as the atmosphere lends itself to conversation.  It is outside the trendy, glitzy, big-name genre.  You are unlikely to see a celebrity here, except there is a small display to  a local Rap Star, Lil Wayne.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Then came the very late delivery of our entrees. My husband's duck dish was good but my trout with smoked oysters was bland and overdone, the veggies on the plate cold and the sauce tasted of liquid smoke. I left it on my plate. The wait staff, which was very conciliatory, offered to replace my entree but i couldn't see waiting another 40 minutes for it to arrive. What a disappointment.

"I hate bullshit answers.  They usually come from people in positions of authority which basically leaves you in a lose - lose situation:  Either dispute the bullshit answer, and it gets you nowhere, or swallow the bullshit answer, and you feel like you've just eaten bullshit.  The place looks nice, with high wood-beam ceilings and stone walls.  I do like the open kitchen, and I think the restrooms are the nicest I've seen in Tucson - close in décor to those at the Venetian.  However, the menus need to be cleaned regularly and clearly are not.  The service was removed.  Yes, she brought everything fast and accurately, but no personality.  No gratitude, no light jokes, no sympathetic faces - like being served by a cardboard box.  - The shrimp appetizer was excellent, wrapped in bacon and stuffed with cream cheese and jalapeno, then finished with a barbecue sauce.  The cheesecakes were also fantastic, reminding me of those biscuits at Red Lobster which I can never get enough of.   - The lemon pepper zucchini sticks - AVOID.  Lightly breaded huge chunks of zucchini sprinkled with lemon pepper seasoning after they are fried, served with ""ranch"" dressing (if you like cloudy water with parsley sprinkled on it, you will L-O-V-E their ranch).  I paid an extra dollar for avocado to receive a teaspoon of avocado on my tuna sandwich, and my wife received a little more avocado but it was full of black spots.  The salad was prepared with cornbread croutons that disintegrate without any crunch, and in no way compliment the salad - which is served with a citrus vinaigrette.  The vinaigrette POPS vinegar, just a whisper of citrus, so it could be sold by some British guy on a 3AM Infommercial to remove those hard water stains or your money back!  ""The ranch is usually not quite that runny because it hasn't had time to settle yet, as he just made it, and the avocados come form a distributor, so we can't control the black spots.""  After hearing that bullshit answer from the manager, I decided no to challenge her on the croutons or the vinaigrette - what would be the point?  And about the avocados, couldn't one just cut off the black spots and maybe deliver more to at least cover my half sandwich???  THE WORST part of the lunch was the awful smell of cleaning supplies that took us by surprise half way through, accompanied by a high pitch whistle that was almost deafening and lasted about 60 seconds before going away.  The place is very loud, and the music IN NO WAY compliments the place.  Dessert was okay - a big wedge of cake no better than we could bake at home for ten bucks a slice, but it fed the five of us.  Lunch was $76, worth about $50.  I should've waited for the check to settle a bit maybe...or maybe the prices come from corporate, so they can't control them.  Either way, I see no point in recommending this place for 2 glorious appetizers and a bunch of bullshit.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Never, ever eat before you come to Half & Half. The mere portions of their delicious food will leave you full for the rest of the day. Pair that with bottomless coffee or one of their delicious house lattes, and you truly have the perfect brunch experience.   Every time I come to Half & Half it is packed, but that doesn't take away from it's homey, farm-fresh atmosphere. The crowd is typically a mix of families, couples, and groups of young people, especially many college students from Wash U nearby.   My go-to entree is now the Sausage Biscuit, which is an oversized flaky biscuit loaded with spicy sausage, fluffy eggs, and cheese. It comes with a side of breakfast potatoes but I've never been able to make it through this ultimate carbo-load, though I have tried because it is so delicious.   Be sure to always check what their specials are on weekends, there is almost always a really unique French toast or a special hash that's loaded with flavor. And if you're feeling especially hungry or adventurous, try an order of doughnuts as an appetizer as you drink a Vanilla latte. You might forget where you because it's so good that it's all you can think about.   One more recommendation for first-timers, be sure to get on the waitlist ahead of time. If you show up anytime near peak hours, you will probably be waiting for at least 45 minutes. Regardless, Half & Half is worth every second spent.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

There are a couple different areas to play including a kitchen, reading corner with blocks and dolls, a train table, an art table, a play house, a projector game room, and a soft corner for non walkers. There's also a hand full of tables facing the play area only a couple feet away for parents.   Entry is $12 per child (9 mos+) or $10 is you make an appointment online. It is a cafe so they have coffee, tea, cookies, muffins, and other kid friendly snacks. For that reason you cannot bring in your own food or drinks, which is unfortunate cause what kid sees an array of snacks and cookies just keeps walking ? Snacks start at .95 for a string cheese and go up to a small snack plate or juice.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Had dinner here tonight and while the staff was friendly, they have very slow service here...seems to be a running theme. Have been to the Speedway location several times and even at their busiest the service was always faster. Was a Monday and expectedly it was pretty slow, which made it even stranger as there were several tables that hadn't been bussed yet...one right up front to greet us! Had to wait a bit at the hostess counter for someone to seat us and then had a pretty significant wait for our food and an even longer wait to pay after getting the bill. Wings were good though, standard Native quality.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Glad to have a new pizza place downtown! The breadsticks are deeelish, and one order was plenty for 4 people. Came with three dips (marinara, garlic sauce, and cheese sauce), but the cheese sauce stole the show. I think it was some kind of cheddar parmesan mixture, and we may or may not have ordered extra just for dipping our crusts... it was that good. I think my friends were embarrassed that I requested an extra vat of cheese sauce, but it didn't stop them from digging in once it arrived. (On a different visit, I tried the mangia rolls. Don't bother, they were dry hockey pucks.)  We tried two pizzas, the Tuscan with fennel sausage, roasted peppers, and crushed red pepper, and the Tarte Flambe with smoked bacon, onion, and gruyere. Both were awesome, and it was hard to pick a favorite. The Tuscan had a nice spicy kick, while the Tarte Flambe was pure cheesy bacon goodness. Could have gone without the plain white onions, though -- they added nothing.  The menu says that one pizza is enough for 1-2 people, and I'd say 2 people is accurate. We took a few slices home, and we're not exactly delicate eaters. Our server was sweet and seemed genuinely interested in whether we were enjoying our meal. All in all, our table was impressed, and we'll definitely be back for more!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Yes, I gave this place 5 stars.  Well deserved.  I have to be honest and say I went in not expected much.  The place is deceivingly large so they can easily accommodate larger parties. We had a party of 5 and with our reservation were sat immediately, drink order taken immediately and were great with their wonderful never ending supply of chips and salsa. You can easily eat healthy on their menu.  They have a great flavorful Kale salad which I added salmon to and ended up bringing some home.  However, I highly suggest trying the apps as we got Ropa Vieja and I fully intend on going back and making this my meal.  My husband got the taco dinner with 3 different tacos and it was amazing.  Everyone at our table was completely satisfied.  The manager stopped by to check on things which was refreshing especially since it seems the service industry in Nashville is lacking in certain restaurants.

"Pizza is regular Domino's pizza.. nothing spectacular, not even worth mentioning.  My problem is with the service. For some reason they refused to let us know that they will not deliver to our neighborhood after 5pm but already started our order and expect us to pick it up and pay full price.  We were already waiting about 20 minutes when we received the call.  If I was notified upfront, fine... But nah. On top of that, 2 different people called us to tell us they won't be delivering our pizza (so I guess they don't talk to each other?) and were rude when they did.

"Yummy!   First of all, before going to this place, I believe that people need to know that this is NOT an authentic Mexican taco place. I feel like many people go in with that kind of mindset and come out disappointed.  With that being said. You can build your own taco here or you can order off of their speciality menu. I always go off the specialty menu and have loved all the tacos I've tried! My favorite, and the one I would recommend to everyone would be Lucy's Fire. Their drinks and app menu is fairly big as well. Their regular, lime margarita is delicious!  Also, they recently opened a location on Mass Ave. and it looks great! Overall, would definitely come again.  Tip 1: They have $5 House Margaritas from Monday-Friday.  Tip 2: Happy Hour is Monday-Friday from 4-7pm.

"Skip the food. Expensive, poorly executed concepts. My BLT, though served with thick-cut bacon, was plain and dry. My boyfriend's turkey sandwich tasted oddly of propane. Bar snacks are comically overpriced. Next.  However, the beer list is top notch and well priced. For lovers of craft beer, this is a great place to go. Not domestics, not big name brews. Local, craft, high-quality beers. The Voodoo Headless Horseman Pumpkin Ale  , on nitro, was the most unique seasonal I've ever had -- like a boozy chai latte, or a drinkable gingersnap. I'd give 4 stars to the brew selection, 3 for the games and just one for the food.  My advice: come here for the beer and the nostalgic pull of old video games(Paperboy, anyone? Perhaps a little Rampage?). Ignore the posturing of fashionable patrons, or middle aged Jersey bros, or cooler-than-thou Brooklynites. Just have fun, drink a bit in the courtyard, play some games.

"Pretty delish...for a place that makes you cook your own food. :) I did enjoy myself, but since I am not a heavy dipper when it comes to sauces or really a big or fast eater, we would have needed another hour just to get through our main course (there 2 hours already); had to take a rain check on dessert.   Of course though, I was on a first date. So, let's get to what's important, already! I mean, the place...you cook your own food! If the food is bad, its um, your fault.   The service was excellent, but I was on a first BLIND date and thankfully the conversation wasn't lagging at all. However, constant interruptions re: food, temperature, more wine (duh!), next course was distracting if you actually attempt to have a conversation, but Ashley was spot on.   First Course: Bread chunks, green apple slices, and cut up veggies to be dipped in a brie and whocaresitwasdeliciousness mixture...which because we talked so much actually started to burn.   Second Course: salad. (crickets)   Third Course: MEAT! The dipping stuff was a wine based liquid heated with GARLIC. Dip a shoe in it and its good. REMEMBER: Stick your skewers in there and as you are enjoying what you have just cooked, have something else in the pot ready to go when you finish the tiny morsel of what ever moo'd, swam, clucked or quacked; hence another reason we missed dessert.   Wine poured and consumed through out the entire 2 hours... Date still cute! Food still good...holy crow its 8:20! WE GOTTA JET!   Management is used to this, I'm guessing. They handed us a gift card to come back for dessert. Good form, Melting Pot.   It was a good experience. Take 3 hours and enjoy The Melting Pot. I suggest some sort of work equity program though...

Brought 10 people in for a business lunch to celebrate the holidays.  Generally speaking I was very disappointed with everything.  The room was freezing to begin with and it took them way to long to adjust the temp.  Our server had zero personality...they had trouble getting everyone their food...basically mass confusion on who gets what salad.  Of the 8 stakes one had to go back and 3 others were very undercooked.  Is this not a steak house?  The restaurant was maybe a third full.

"This place reminded me of the Seinfeld soup #### episode. We walked in and we were not acknowledged. The family of four that was sitting in six chairs at the bar quickly made room for the two of us. They only had 10 chairs at the bar and two additional 2-person tables. It is good because the owner/chef cooks for one or two people at a time and couldn't handle a crowd bigger than this. We tried to eat here another time but just like a lot of other millennials we don't usually have cash on us.  The owner/chef was done making the meal for the family that was there and then brought us water. He asked me what I wanted as he was walking by and I told him. My husband never got to tell him what he wanted. So when he was walking by us again I said ""beef bibimbap for him"". No response but he seemed to be cooking two things for us so we were hopeful. We did get both of our meals. I got the chicken bibimbap.  With all this going on, I thought perhaps the food would be good. It was not. Both of our meals lacked flavor. The protein part was okay, the egg was overcooked and rice was lukewarm at best. The sauce was bland. The best part about my bowl was the sautéed carrots and cucumbers.   This place is a hole in the wall - I get it but it feels less like a restaurant and more like eating at a friend's dorm room. A friend that doesn't want you to be there.  Would I go back here? Most certainly not.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I had mixed feelings after eating here.    First, the service was below average.  There was nobody to greet us when we got in and even after going upstairs, our waiter seemed at a complete loss as to what to do when I told him we had no reservations, and wound up gesturing towards the tables and mumbling 'I guess there's a table open over there'.  I think he might have been the only waiter there and so was super busy, but whatever the case it wasn't impressive.  The bread and garlic spread was a mixed bag.  The spread was actually really good if a bit on the strong side, but the bread was very dry and just about required a drink after each slice.  Whoever had cut it had done a poor job as well as we had to finish cutting each slice to get it off the loaf.  We had their gouda quesadilla for an appetizer, and that was easily the best part of the meal.  It was pretty simple, just gouda, prosciutto and caramelized onion, but the flavours all blended very nicely and made for an excellent overall dish.  I had the chicken parmesan, and it was about as bog standard as it gets for chicken parmesan.  I've had better, I've had worse.  The pasta was a big disappointment.  It was thick and rubbery and not served with enough sauce so it was mostly flavourless as well.  Pasta is one of those things that you really have to be able to do well as an Italian restaurant, and this just didn't make the grade.  In the end, the place was really a mixed bag.  My entrée was competent, but boring, the pasta was straight up bad, but the gouda quesadilla was not only interesting, but delicious.  If more of their food was like that, something that I couldn't get at a thousand other Italian restaurants, I'd be back in a heartbeat, but as-is, I'm not sure I'll be coming back any time soon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Bang bang shrimp is delicious, and they know it. So now there are tacos, yum! I always love the shrimp. They also have a surprisingly good house salad that has hearts of palm in it.

During the pandemic they are offering ""family bundles"" -- at least I didn't think that was a thing until now.. I could be wrong! They're nice. For two people it can last for about four separate meals depending on your appetite. If you have a big appetite then let's say 3 or 3.5 meals. We ordered the bundle with wood grilled shrimp, broccoli, 2 loaves of bread, 4 cookies, and it's supposed to come with house salad but unfortunately didn't reach us (we were refunded).

"(This review is about sweet crepes-I did not try their savory crepes, smoothies or frozen yogurt)  I'm picky.  Really picky.  I'm a foodie.  I've had crepes prepared properly in far flung travels.  If you have too, then you probably know a crepe should not be as chewy or thick as a handmade tortilla.  (Though if they are using the same batter for their savory crepes, which I presume are like a wrap, maybe they want the tougher texture???)  I was excited to try this place, as the entire center has taken on a foodie feel with Flemings Steakhouse (good), the Cheese Shop (meh), and Gigi's cupcakes (meh~Confectioneiress in Zionsville my favorite) and Omaha Steaks (really?).  The good: I like to support little and local businesses.  This has the feel of a nice, personally- owned business. The staff was super; welcoming, knowledgable, efficient, warm~great really! Clean and kept up. Many little samples on an outside table to try (I didn't sample)  The not-so-good: If you are selling food, the food has to be great~and a lot of that is based on the quality of ingredients. (I ordered the sweet crepe with chocolate and banana) The banana was green, so lacked sweet banana flavor The chocolate in the crepe was acceptable The crepe was chewy and thicker than it should have been The crepe was drizzled in a chocolate sauce of such low-quality that it would probably say chocolate ""flavored"" sauce on the bottle and mostly contain corn syrup and very little cocoa or chocolate.  Makes Hershey's chocolate syrup taste like a gourmet syrup in comparison. (Not to dog Hershey's syrup~it's a good every-day quality syrup) The whipped cream (you can order sweet crepes with whipped cream and fruit instead of chocolate) they use is from the can.  Starbucks makes their own whipped cream.  If you are selling a dessert, it makes a difference.   It hurts a little to not give them at least 3 stars, because the spirit of the staff was super.  But alas, they are serving food.  It has to be good.  Maybe if I give them another chance, I will try the savory crepes or the frozen yogurt instead.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Would get zero stars except that wasnt an option!!!!!!  The place looked inviting so we stopped in.  Service was average at best.  When I asked about beer on tap was handed a printed black and white copy. Ok ran low make copies I get it. Beer selection is great if you have staff that actually knows how to sell it.  I knew more about the draft on my first visit than our server who said she has worked there for over a year.  Apps were ordered and came out, calamari was rubber and cold! fish taco's cold, ribs were ok if you like out of the bag crap.  wife's salad had wilted lettuce!  Seriously who is in charge of montoring this, obviously NOBODY.  Only good thing was the draft that I trained the server on.   The manager looked as if she was too busy worrying about how good she thougt she looked, sorry hunny your not all that and neither is your place.

"Went here last week with my girlfriend and another couple for dinner.  Got seated fairly quickly then proceeded to wait 20 minutes to put our order in, another 10 for our drinks, another 30 for our less than stellar meals and another 20 for our over priced check.  For a $100 meal, I expect it to be at least good to great, this was mediocre at best.  Wings looked like they butchered pigeons to get them, very small.  Burger was a burger, chicken was chicken and the $20 fish and chips were comparable to a $5.99 filet-o-fish value meal.  Go to Village Whiskey, BIG thumbs down for P&K.

"This is the worst restaurant I've ever paid more than $30 to eat at, and I can only further describe it as beyond fucking disgusting. The food was so extremely salty I eventually could no longer bear to continue with the meal. When I reported the excess salt to the curious waiter as to why I did not enjoy my experience he dispatched a tall female maitre 'd who was the rudest human I have ever encountered in the hospitality industry. Interacting with her alone is enough to put me off Lacroix for life, so it's lucky the food is far from desirable. Avoid this place at all costs.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I was there as a Delivery driver to pick up food. Took over 30 minutes to get the burger and fries, and they waited until then to let me know they were out of milkshake and that I HAD to inform the costumer about so she could get a refund from the app. I contacted the app and asked whose responsibility was it to let the costumer know the order was incomplete and as expected the restaurant is responsible for that. Next pick up, I ran into the same issue I told the manager what the app had said, he got upset and said he would not do it and to cancel if I didn't want to take a partial order. The restaurant had only about 10 costumers in it so it wasn't busy. Some employees spent more time arguing with the manager than working. App has the option to block any items in the menu that they are out, learned to properly use the tools at your disposal and don't pass your responsibilities to other.

Not a fan. I got the pork dinner plate with Mac n Cheese and baked beans. The pork was tough and the sauce wasn't very good.

Slow service. We were wondering what was taking so long when the waitress finally showed up with ALL OF OUR FOOD at the same time  wings soup and entrees. The best I can say is that the food was edible...but not enjoyable. Taco salad had an overcooked chopped up burger not seasoned ground beef. There was zero taste.  I picked through to eat the lettuce. French onion soup was onions cheese and watery broth. Blue cheese with the wings was watered down. I should have gone to yelp first but we were just driving by and it looked busy. Two stars because at least the bar looked full. Don't go for dinner.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The hostess made us feel very unwelcome. I figured maybe she was having an off day, but while waiting to be seated I read multiple reviews complaining of a lack of hospitality. After waiting 40 min of our 45 min wait, I'd read enough reviews to decide to cancel.   I'm really bummed because I thought the restaurant itself was nice, I liked the beach vibe. And the food looked great! I'm just personally put off by businesses that habitually make customers feeling like a nuisance. No one wants to spend money to feel mistreated... I mean okay some people are into that, and that's totally fine as long as everything is fully consensual, safe and of course legal. But we just wanted lobster rolls-- which is not code for anything!

"I stopped in here because I read they had authentic tonkotsu ramen, but what I got was broth with soy milk. The proof was I took some of the broth home and kept it in the fridge over night. The broth was still watery. Real tonkotsu stock has lots of collagen and connective tissue from the bones so when it cools, it becomes gelatinous, almost like a really soft set Jello. The broth was also kind of one note with not too much depth or complexity. Also, no tare or seasonings. There was only 2 pieces of chashu that again, were pretty bland and still cold from the fridge. It only came with 1/2 of a hard boiled egg as opposed to the soft boiled egg that makes ramen sing! The noodles were OK but nothing impressive. Also, there was nothing about this ramen that made it unique or interesting. No nori, red pepper threads, vegetables, or anything that makes it look like there was any thought or care put into the ramen, which, when done correctly, can create addicts!  The yakitori was really good though. I had the chicken, chicken skin, and pork belly. They were all beautifully charred, tender, juicy, and flavorful with just the right amount of dressing to make it really pop! I would order all of them in excess if I would go back. The only thing is that it took about 20 minutes to get them to my table for some reason. Its yakitori, not sous vide!  Service was OK. Not great but not bad or ruinous. Just mediocre.  I was pretty disappointed in the ramen, but the yakitori was the real attraction if you have patience to wait for it!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Not sure what I just experienced.  Been coming to NOLA couple or three times a year since we purchased a small condo in 2015 and as we eere reading the menu a passerby told us how great this place was. Well, we arrived on time as always for a 6:15 p.m. reservation.  Wanted something later but nothing was available, except of course the 2 to 4 tables near us that remained empty throughout our meal and still remained empty when we left at around 7:30. 15 minutes waiting for our check, so definitely hustled through our meal. Our tuna crudo was definitely served up much different than th e chef's friend's or associates a couple tables away. Normally try not to pay too much attention as to what's going on at other tables but there was so much commotion with taking pictures it was hard not to notice. My hot soup came out th e same time as th e sushi grade tuna app. Clear indication we were getting hustled through our meal.

Food is ok (honey bar is awesome ) but service is ridiculously slow. If your looking for an option that is healthy and quick this is not the place.

Today I waited 55 minutes to get my stirfy.Obviously something is not working. Get a better operating model because 4 cooks and having them wash their own pan between cooks is obviously not working.

Food was ready when we ordered it. Ordered the chicken pesto basil pizza but they were out of grilled chicken and so they put pieces of chicken strips on it instead which was not the same - wish that they had told us or asked if we still wanted it. :( We had to order an additional pizza when more people arrived and they were slammed so it wasn't ready until we were all ready to leave.

"I really wanted to like this place. I ordered the Orange Chicken - medium, steamed dumplings, crab Rangoon and Tom Yum soup - medium. The orange chicken was very good, crispy and not overly sweet. I'd recommend that for sure. Dumplings looked pretty but didn't come with dipping sauce and were a little dry. The Tom Yum soup wasn't horrible, it actually was almost really good except it was a little on the sweet side and just not my preference. If you like sweeter Tom Yum soup then you'd like this. Lastly, don't order the crab Rangoons at all. They were horrible and had barely any stuffing and the sauce almost ruined it and tasted stale and was very thick.  So it was alright. I'd go there again only for the orange chicken but probably would pass as it wasn't amazing.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We went to Triumph this past weekend for a friends birthday party. The bar is pretty nice and has a more relaxed atmosphere than some of the other bars in the area. We enjoyed standing by the windows on the second floor watching the bouncers across the street at Mad River ply their trade with the younger crowd as the night wore on.   Being that we were in a large group there were several trays of finger foods ordered and all of the options were good although none were great.   The beer selection is somewhat limited in that they only serve their own brews, which is fine. The lager was too light for my tastes, so I switched to the Amber Ale which was pretty good and I stuck with for the rest of the night.

"Just glancing through the reviews makes me question myself. Did I have a bad day when I went here...?   But I mean, the mere fact that there are reviews ranging from one end of the spectrum to the other should say at least something about the restaurant's quality and consistency with its dishes (or lack of which).  I heard about this place from a few Asian friends, saying that they always order Sang Kee's duck to go whenever they visit Chinatown.  Being native to Beijing and having tasted various indigenous ""Peking Ducks"" in China, I was very enthralled by such a positive statement.  My parents and I went together, and here's what we've concluded:   Duck: the Peking Duck was pretty good, but definitely not memorable.  The crispy duck, on the other hand, was another story... Crispy indeed but drenched in greasy and clearly overcooked as there were very few indications of its freshness.  Maybe I was just being critical but for a restaurant that prides itself with being the ""Duck House,"" this dish is acceptable at best.  On another note, the presentation of the dishes makes it pretty appetizing.    Atmosphere: this place makes you want to eat and then get out.  Noisy and not really clean looking.  Good for a quick lunch I'd say, however the wait will probably stop you from entering on most days.    Service: from what I remember there was nothing wrong with the service.  However the waiter did spill a pitcher of water on the floor and everyone watched as he mopped it away (as there was nothing else remotely entertaining).  Takeout: this is one service that we did not try, so it may very well be good.  Stop by if you're on the way, but nothing we've tried was solely worth the drive from Jersey.  Overall, the place was nothing special.  It was personally disappointing probably because I had expected much better.  I'm a little tempted to go back again and hopefully prove myself wrong, since the other places that have ducks would probably be of similar quality or even sub par. But hey, if you go in with little expectations, maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Thank goodness for this establishment! When I saw that they were opening a Pieology in Goleta, I could hardly contain myself. What's better than a make your own pizza place, where you can put anything and everything you want on it for 9 bucks? If you like the thinner crusts rather than deep dish, this place is for you!  Having been here several times since their opening in 2016, I have had a pleasant experience on most of my visits. Staff are great at asking what you want on your pizza and how you want your pizza. Make sure to get the herb butter on your crust to get that full flavor. The pizza is baked in their oven very quickly and to a nice thin crispy crust, not burnt. It's not too greasy, and the herb butter perfectly gives you that blend of herbs while preventing your pizza from being too dry but not wet either. The variety of vegetables and meats is great, and the staff are good at making sure it's made to your liking. I do feel that some of the staff members could use more training in terms of efficiency and keeping the line moving. Other than that, great pizza makers!  Very nice and clean inside, with plentiful seating for dining and a nice outdoor area for dining outdoors. It's located in the developing Hollister plaza next to the Hollister Village apartments.

"4 stars Just your average sports bar. We were a party of 5 at 9:30 on a Saturday night.  They have a ton of televisions. No bad seat in the house to watch any game.  Bloody Mary was decent. Nothing extraordinary and reasonably priced. Beers were cold. Appetizers- Fried pickles were good. A bit greasy for my taste. Served with a horseradish dipping sauce. Pretzels were great. Soft and warm, served with cheese sauce. Toasted ravioli was good. Nothing special. I wouldn't be surprised if they are pulling them out of the freezer, dipping them in the fryer and sprinkling them with parm. Tots were seasoned. There was nothing wrong with them. I imagine you would have to try really hard to screw those up. For the main course we ordered 50 wings naked, with 4 dipping sauces on the side, blue cheese and ranch. The wings were good. Not great. Total bill $91.50. Not bad for 5 people. This is a good place to go and watch sports, have a drink, eat some bar food.

"First time visit. Excellent location: right next door to the parking garage, right across the street from The Vouge, & a redline bus stop directly in front. Decor was fine; the crowning jewel being dozens of super cool black velvet portraits of rock legends.   The bar, of course is the main attraction with more than a hundred beers on tap. My husband, being Belgian, & always keen to try out local Belgian style beers, ordered Table, by Central State brewery. It wasn't his favorite. I had a sip & thought it was good; light, slightly tart, & hoppy.  I however was very disappointed that they had no mocktails to offer. Of course the waiter offered to have them make me something, I declined, as I've never had any luck finding a good mocktail that way.   Our waiter was super friendly & attentive. They were not very busy when we got there but by the time we left, they were.   The food was all over the place. The main takeaway was that it was a little on the cold side. Most of it was still warm enough to tolerate except my husband's soup (it definitely qualified as cold). We didn't complain or send anything back. The French fries were the best. They are thin fries but still soft inside & seasoned to perfection with some concoction that is salty, tart, & the tiniest bit sweet, kind of reminiscent of barbecue potato chip dust. Also, the side of cheese sauce to dip was really good, if only it had been a little bit thicker so it would have clinged to the fries. I got the mushroom & swiss double smash burger. Since it wasn't that hot, my swiss wasn't completly melted, & the smash burger wasn't carmelized (what my idea of a good smash burger is) but otherwise the bun & toppings were good.   The bathroom needed a little attention. The trash was overflowing & both the tp & paper towels were not in holders but just sitting on shelves.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"If I could give this location zero stars I most definitely would. The customer service is horrible. I called for a reservation and asked if they could accommodate 7 people the representative I spoke to said yes and made a reservation. When we arrived, we were told there was no reservation and they couldn't seat 7 people. The person at the front was rude and doesn't know how to talk to people. She shouldn't even be working in a customer service place. After we decided to do take out instead the manager asked us to step out and she was rude and racist. They need a new manager.

"I came here with 4 friends after leaving the tattoo convention at the convention center. We had plans to eat elsewhere but there was a wait at almost every restaurant around us but we were starving and did not want to wait so we came here. The place was pretty full but the still had a couple tables left so we were seated right away which was nice. That was pretty much the end of our good experience though. The one other plus was that a large pot of hot tea and glasses of water were put on the table as soon as we sat down and the tea was delicious. We looked at our menus and decided what to eat in about ten minutes and we hadn't seen a waiter yet. We did notice though that there was a huge birthday party next to us, with at least 30 or 40 people so we gave them a break figuring they were really busy with them. Another 15 minutes pass though and we are starting to get frustrated because none of us had eaten that day and we didn't want to wait anymore. Finally a waiter comes and takes our order, We got fried dumplings, crab balls from the dim sum menu, general tsos chicken, sweet and sour chicken, house special fried rice, pork fried rice, wonton soup with udon noodles, dragons and pheonix, and bbq scallops. The fried dumplings and crab claw balls came out in good time but nearly everything else took well over an hour and when the dishes finally started coming out they were coming out about 10 minutes apart. Then they accidentally brought out another general tsos instead of a sweet and sour so once everyone at the table had their food (minus the bbq scallops but more on that in a minute) and was eating and one of my friends was just sitting there picking off all of our plates while she waited, by the time she finally got her food everyone else was done eating so we asked for the bbq scallops which were an appetizer which still hadnt come out some boxes and the bill. It took an addition 15 minutes but finally we got the scallops and the $80 bill. Overall I just felt cheated, the food was subpar, the service was awful and it wasn't until after we left that we realized that all of our meals were supposed to come with steamed rice and we didn't get it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The location is open air, but the employees didnt wear masks, which was surprising. My gripe was the brisket was very dry, and the green beans were very salty. and for what we got the price was very high!

I went to Rick's on the River with friends not knowing what to expect. We usually frequent other seafood restaurants but wanted to try something new. We went on a chilly night but called ahead and were told there were heaters on the patio. There was indoor seating but our group was too large to sit in a booth so we needed to sit outside at the picnic tables. Unfortunately the large heater was not on and it was uncomfortably cold. We asked for the heater but if appeared to be broken. I ordered the bacon cheese fries and they were decent. They had nacho cheese instead of shredded cheese. For dinner I got the fish sandwich and it was good! It came on a hoagie with lettuce and tomato. The tartar sauce was not restaurant made which would have been better. I got a strawberry margarita and it was strong. One of my friends got the shrimp dinner and they were small like salad shrimp. I would like to come back when it's warmer and give this place another try.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The low score reviews on this restaurant  are (per typical clueless Yelpers.....) not really about the food. Someone's mad because the owner did not let their service dog in the restaurant or someone else is mad because they had too much cheese one time and not enough another time so rather than ask for more cheese they drop a one star review. I hate stupid yelpers sorry.....   Yelp reviews should be about food and or service of said food and specific location ambience which applies to everyone, not your personal issue with your damn dog or something equally as irrelevant.

"I work in North County, so when it comes to lunch, I usually just bring something from home; it's good for my wallet (and my waistline!) and to be honest, Hazelwood just doesn't offer much in the way of (non-chain) food.   But when I read Jonathan's review of Thyme Table Cafe and noted that he tried their pumpkin bread pudding, I KNEW I had to try this place. Umm...hello? Pumpkin AND bread pudding? Two of my favorite things!   Anyway, I called Thyme table to see if they were offering pumpkin bread pudding. It IS fall, after all! Sadly, they weren't, but they were still offering regular bread pudding. That was enough to get me out the door!   Thyme Table is nestled in a cutesy part of Ferguson. Old Ferguson, if you will. There were lots of cute little hole-in-the-wall shops. It almost reminded me of Old Town St. Charles. Kind of.   Anyway, I called in my order and was on my way. I arrived about 10 minutes later, and after a short 5 minute wait, my food was ready. I read a note on the menu that said something along the lines of ""be patient because we cook everything to order!"". I always see that as a good sign; I'm willing to wait a little longer for great food.   I ordered the BLT on marble rye bread and bread pudding. The BLT was okay. Nothing special, really. The marble rye bread was an interesting touch, but other than that, it didn't knock my socks off.   The bread pudding? Well...it was a little cooler than room temperature. Like it had been refrigerated at one point, and was just coming to room temp. Now...I've had a lot of bread pudding in my day (a LOT!) and I've never had room temperature/cold bread pudding. I like it piping hot, or at least warm!   Whoever put my order together was nice enough to put the caramel sauce and whipped cream in little to-go cups, which was nice.   But the bread pudding was just mediocre to me. It was custard like, and the piece they gave me was HUGE, but it just wasn't good enough to eat the whole thing. And when I don't eat my entire serving of bread pudding, you know something's up! :)  The atmosphere was cute. It seemed to be pretty popular with locals; the place was about half full.   I probably won't be back. The food wasn't BAD, but it wasn't great either.   Unless they bring back pumpkin bread pudding. Then I'll be OBLIGATED to come back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
This is a fairly new restaurant in the Delmar Loop neighborhood. We went on a Sunday evening and the place was empty at dinner time - never a good sign - but we were all pleasantly surprised.  It's next door to the wildly popular Mission Taco on Eastgate.  We were a group of 4 and ate family style. We ordered the Garlic Naan (Delicious!) Vegetable Curry (good) Lamb Saag (Very good) and Chicken Tikka Kabob (Delicious!). Everything was served hot and tasted very fresh. The chicken dish in particular was perfectly seasoned.

"If you're craving a burrito or some nachos, I'll generally recommend a good Moe's. Are there lots of places you can get Americanized Mexican food? Sure. So how does this particular Moe's stack up against the rest? Just so-so.  I've been here half a dozen times over the past 6 months, sheerly because it is convenient, as I work in the same building. I've paid attention to the level of ingredients served with each visit, and just in this year alone I've noticed several important things that have affected my opinion of this location (and perhaps other Moe's franchises as well): 1. The ratio of rice/beans to protein has drastically been increased. This means I'm finding a LOT more rice/beans and a lot LESS meat. This also makes the burrito VERY dry... 2. There are a couple folks in there who could use some courtesy lessons - specifically the older gentleman who seems to be stationed out on the dining room floor to collect dishes, etc. He seems content to just as soon bowl you over to get by you as to stop and let you pass. 3. The nickel-and-diming has gotten OUT of CONTROL.  For example: the first 2-3 times I went, I purchased a burrito - the Joey Bag of Donuts - and ordered it with this new tasty ancho-lime chicken and a douse of queso. The price never changed, regardless of what I put on it. Now when I go, the ancho-lime chicken is extra, the TINIEST spoon of queso (applied to the burrito, not in a cup on the side) is a whopping $1 extra, and several other options also now seem to be considered ""upgrades"" costing more and more with every choice.  Don't get me wrong, I understand economics quite well. More means extra, right? Wrong. Not when you already charge $8 for a burrito. You bake in those extra costs to the initial price so that customers don't feel taken advantage of. This concept is akin to brick and mortar stores not price matching their own website.... Come on, this 2016. Consolidate your pricing and make the customer experience and quality of your product your main focus. Ditch the extra costs, fees, and add-ons that frustrate your customer base and force them to seek out your competitors. Sheesh.  Back to the negatives. The last 3 times I have been, the chips served with your meal have been SUPER stale, bland, and completely tasteless... some even borderline hard. Combine this with the seemingly inordinate task of keeping salsa in stock at the tiny salsa bar, super conveniently placed RIGHT NEXT TO THE CHECKOUT, and you have a recipe for frustration.  I repeat, the only reason I continue to go is because I work in the same building, and to be fair, on Monday's they have a $5 deal that includes the burrito of your choice, chips, and salsa. Just be warned, if you ask for anything other than basic chicken or ground beef, the nickel-and-diming begins. Before you know it, you've walked up to the cashier and are now paying $9 for a $5 burrito.  Overall, there are better places for burritos, chips, and salsa elsewhere. Be prepared to overpay here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"absolutely no frills, perfectly acceptable quality food for the prices, and props for the variety.  I'm not into the ""let's throw peanut shells on the floor"" deal but somehow we found ourselves at this fine dining establishment on a busy Mother's Day.  Our waiter, while humorless, was attentive and the food came out quickly.  Two highlights, one for my healthy side and one for my drunkard side:  BOTTOMLESS salad, yes please, pile it on! I loved that garlic ranch dressing too.  TWO FOR ONE drinks?! This is nearly unheard of where I live. This only runs from opening to 7 pm so hit the early bird special and have your drinking pants on (you know, the stretchy kind). I tried the char grilled shrimp and they haven't made me sick yet so I'm happy with it! That being said, they didn't seem super fresh to me compared to other local establishments that actually serve local catch.  The shrimp was served on a bed of ""wild"" rice...the most wild thing about it was its yellow hue, it kind of reminded me of the boxed Uncle Ben's, but totally palatable so no worries there. The steamed veggies, also very plain but that's what I asked for.  Everyone else seemed happy with their dishes too!

Bottles and dishes promptly attended to on the table (we had a lot), glasses were promptly refilled (a key test of mine to see how well a table is being watched). Flavors, however, were what we sought, and boy, did we get. Just excellent. Vibrant. Interesting. Everyone remarked about it on the way home, and in social media thereafter. Decor in the restaurant is very interesting/high-end, and the bathrooms were in very good order (as George Perrier said, ""A restaurant's kitchen is as clean as its bathrooms). Easy parking.

"Not impressed  On a search for the best Lemon Chicken - this is DEFINITELY .......NOT.....IT! Ordered take-out. It took a LONG time to get done - they said it ""takes a while"".....that's clearly because their deep fryer temp is too low. The chicken was mush - the coating was mush....even before the lemon sauce was put on it. (only a couple of minutes from home - it was still hot.) Speaking of lemon sauce - more like lemon-flavored water - didn't even stand up to the plain white rice - couldn't tell it was even on the chicken. Asked for a quart (large size) of wonton soup - got a small size. Another couple ordered after me - theirs was put into the deep fryer before mine (because ""yours takes longer""). Hmmmmmm...... On another note - ladies room was out of order - but no sign on the door to tell you that - so small you have to almost back into the room in order to get past the door. I did end up with an extra egg roll in my bag - was it an accident or an apology? Didn't eat anything else because the chicken was so heavy - the rest will have to wait until much later.

"The space is spotless, spacious and modern. The service is fine. Our wedge fries were hearty and steaming hot, and the sauces - garlic pepper vegan mayo and an insanely spicy sauce called Big Bang - were tasty.  But I have to agree with at least one other reviewer: 3 Potato 4 is overpriced.  The large bag of wedge fries, which feeds two not-exactly-starving people, is $8. Maybe a buck more than I'd charge, but fair enough. But then they charge an additional $1 for each little cup of dipping sauce you order. (Unless you scrimp, one cup of sauce is not enough for the large bag.)  Here's the real crime, however: You want ketchup, malt vinegar or Sriracha, which 99.999% of all the restaurants on Earth offer completely free? Here you have to shell out 50 cents. Each.  Seriously, 3 Potato 4? Charging 50 cents for ordinary ketchup? Why don't you charge for napkins and drinking straws while you're at it?  Don't be stingy. Your fries are pricy enough. Offer your condiments for free. And consider offering at least the first sauce for free as well, and charge $1 for each additional sauce.

"Once upon a time, there was Wonder Wok in Sparks...  The hole-in-the-wall place had a wonderful charm to it; and  several of their dishes, especially Singapore Mei Fun, was really, really terrific. However, they closed, making you wonder why some shops serving crappy Chinese food endure, while ones that offer high-quality fare struggle. Wonder Wok reopened under a different name a couple of years ago, but didn't last. Again, the question.  If you're a fan of really good pork fried rice with onion, carrot and bean sprouts, then - go somewhere else, because what they serve at China Noodles really sucks.  Sucks, sucks, sucks.  Before, going there, I didn't know it was possible to serve fried rice that was both underdone and crunchy AND sticky at the same time. However, China Noodles has pulled it off. Instead of barbecued pork, the dish contained what appeared to be tiny cubes of ham instead. Plus, it didn't contain any of the aforementioned vegetables.   On the other hand, their Singapore Mei Fun is excellent, approaching what I was used to at Wonder Wok. The dish is deep yellow with curry and has a strong, spicy flavor. From what I could see of their menu, they offer an off-beat cuisine that I thought only Wonder Wok served: for instance, Barbecued Pork Noodle soup, which can be really fantastic.

But last night, we decided to try the Okra. That was our mistake. The okra was not fresh nor was it properly cut. When eating fresh okra, there should be a crunch and the okra should have been a brighter green color. It was not edible and we had to throw it away. I am a bit disappointed because the other 2 dishes were as usual, amazing. I am sad to have given them 3 stars as I do appreciate everything else. I will still definitely come back, I just would not order the Okra ever again. I do have the picture of the okra, but the other 2 dishes were so amazing, we didn't have a chance to take the pictures.  I appreciate the owner reaching out. But I should also note the quality of the okra was not fresh at all as we live a few mins from the restaurant. Not long enough for the okra to be soggy.

Unfortunately they ran out of a couple items (not surprising since it's a seafood restaurant), but they were very accommodating when we wanted to substitute certain things for the ""combos meals."" Speaking of combo meals - must try the crack crab sauce. Which is a mixture of all four sauces. I did mild, and it was plenty spice for me, yet delicious!   Service was excellent. Very attentive to us and every table that was there. Price was super reasonable for the amount of food. Pictured is the ""combo #10."" We shared it and it was definitely enough for 3 people. We'll be back for some more. Hopefully they'll have blue crabs next time!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"The typical diner run down exterior is misleading as the interior is charming.   The deliciousness of the banana walnut pancakes and bacon cheddar omelet were overshadowed by having a neglectful waitress which  was enough to ruin our experience.  She never offered a refill of coffee or to see if we needed anything after placing our order.  After the food runner delivered our meal, the waitress that never introduced herself just dropped the bill off.  We had to flag her down several times to keep requesting a first glass of water.  I wanted to box up my leftovers but she never returned since tossing the bill on our table.  We ended up taking the leftovers to the hostess when paying the bill.  The hostess unapologetically handed us a box and then immediately went to help the next person leaving us standing there to handle our leftover pancakes awkwardly without utensils.

"So I've been coming here for about a year now. Good sushi in SB is scarce and so I settle for Sushi Terri if not Edomasa. Anyway, the service here was horrible the last time I had dinner here and I felt the need to review. While the servers do seem friendly, they are very disorganized. We had 3 different servers help us throughout our dinner and while one might think we were served quickly because of that, we weren't. We ordered 3 rolls that took 45 minutes to arrive and because of the poor communication amongst the servers, I don't think they realized how long it took for our food to arrive and failed to apologize.   The sushi is okay. Their rolls are creative. I haven't tried them all but the mastercard is my favorite of theirs. I'm a snob when it comes to miso soup and theirs is pretty good!  The environment is warm and friendly. The booths are comfortable and you have the option to sit outside if weather permits, which it usually does.   But won't come back again.

"Everything our six had was really rich or greasy, so if you're sensitive to that you may have a hard time after the fact. (Two of our six did.) However, it is the kind of richness and greasiness you crave and was very well done, so look at this as ""not quite five stars"" rather than ""one star off"" since it was totally worth it. Aggressive seasoning, well executed fried foods, sides that are high quality and not just an afterthought. (I'm looking at you, broccoli and mushrooms.) Server was on the ball and friendly, bartenders took time to talk liquor with my buddy. Wings were really good, my son love this chicken sandwich, the  Nashville sliders were awesome and caused one of our party to declare he had a new go-to favorite when I gave him one of mine.

Soggy ""twice fried"" fries had twice the grease because they also sat too long before bsing delivered to our table.

Instead, we paid $35 for for burgers & shakes for two, then couldn't eat them because they were ruined from sitting too long. Ugh.   People are ironically nice.  Soda selection is nice.

"First warning for the sage traveler...if the establishment touts that it's where all the locals go be very leery. I went for breakfast on Saturday at 7 am. (when they open) I was greeted by a friendly woman who let me know up front I could get drinks but not food cause the cooks weren't in yet. No problem, I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was decent. About 30 minutes later I was able to order food. I kept it simple eggs, bacon & potatoes. The eggs were not as I ordered and clearly fresh out of carton. Bacon underwhelming and the potatoes were awful. I opted for another Bloody Mary and the 2nd one tasted like what you'd get in an airport -- ew. I suppose I got the special treatment with my first Bloody Mary to make up for food not being available.

Efy was steaming hot when served and so full of flavor. The service was quick as well. I'm a huge fan of spring rolls, but this particular one, not so much.

"Possibly the worst food I've ever eaten in my life. Totally deserves negative 1 stars.   I decided on this place because it looked like the healthiest option in the terminal. I ordered a grilled chicken & avocado panini, a blueberry muffin & a water, and the water was the only thing I could stomach.   I waited quite a while for my food & then had to rush to my gate, so it was only after I settled into my seat that I started to smell the food. It didn't exactly smell like food at all. I've never really smelled that odor before. I think it might be what yoga mats smell like when they're on fire. Anyway, I had to check that the odor was coming from the food bag, because it seemed so toxic. Yes, it was the food.  But the thing is, I was hungry & I'd just spent $15 on all of this & was hunkering down for a transcontinental flight. I decided to take a look: gray avocado, chicken covered by a layer of clear slime, one piece of limp iceberg lettuce on a roll. I cleared off the avocado & tried a tiny bite. I've never tasted, or perhaps untasted chicken like that before. It had no flavor, and practically no texture, and was definitely coated in un-identifiable slime... Not to mention the bread was now soggy with said slime and the chemical smell.  I quickly wrapped the sandwich back up & called the flight attendant to take it away. The smell was starting to make me sick & I couldn't wait for her to come by later in the flight with the trash bag.  I wasn't too upset, because I still had a giant blueberry muffin, and how can you go wrong with a muffin?? By making it tasteless! I suppose it's remarkable how they managed to get nearly no discernible taste into a baked good like that. Only the ""blueberries"" tasted vaguely sweet, but certainly not tart or any taste that someone blindfolded might determine as blueberry. Considering the large mass of carbs & gluten in my hand that tasted like spongy air, I wrapped the muffin up & put it aside too.  20 minutes later I had an Alaska Airlines Reuben sandwich in my hands. $6 and vastly superior. Tasty! No hint of chemical toxicity! Texture!   I will never,ever go to this place again. They make airline food seem like Morimoto.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"This spot was one of the more disappointing dining experiences I have ever had in my 13 years in Nashville.   Let's start with the COVID-19 protocols. We chose this spot in hopes of socially distant outdoor seating. All they've done is cram a bunch of picnic tables inside an inclosed tent with no cross draft or circulation of air.   They've moved to disposable utensils, plates, cups, etc. While this cheapens the experience, it was the service and food quality that really knocked down the star rating. The server never offered water. They brought a cup of coffee when we ordered it, but never refilled the coffee and never offered other beverages. I didn't have a drink for any portion of my meal.   The food was delivered cold. Probably had to do with the paper plates. The portion of ""2 eggs"" in my breakfast were the size of a six egg omelette. If they had used any seasoning it probably would have tasted good. The grits were cold and congealed. The sausage was cold. The biscuit basket was great. I'd recommend the biscuits. Of course, you can only eat so many biscuits without a drink to wash it down...did I mention they didn't bring water?  My wife ordered Brussels sprouts hash. It looked really good on the menu, but when it arrived we learned that the menu ingredient ""potatoes"" actually meant canned yams tossed with Brussels sprouts and peppers. It tasted bad and the ingredients were misrepresented on the menu.   Dining here was a disappointment. There are so many good places to eat in Nashville. Don't let this place suck you in.

"With our hotel a few doors down, this Frenchy's became our ""go-to"" spot while on vacation. Their food was good, definitely better than Crabby Bill's next door, and they have pretty fantastic prices on their beer ($2.75 for Shock Top or Yuengling, I think, even cheaper during happy hour). They also had my favorite frozen Rum Runner - and I definitely believe the other reviewer who said they had to change their recipe because it wouldn't freeze in the machine - these were border-line FROZEN as we were drinking them - almost uncomfortable, but so refreshing.  Their food was pretty solid, for beach fare. We had their special one night of coconut shrimp - and dammit, I may be an ignorant landlocked hoosier, but DAMN that was the best coconut shrimp I've had. The one odd thing we ordered though, was the smoked fish spread. The spread itself was pretty good - but it was served with packaged crackers. Like, how Saltine crackers are packaged when you order soup or something, two at a time. WTF? Please do better with this, it was pretty ghetto.

If you are reading this and still trying to decide to eat here please take notice to all of the bad reviews posted before mine . My family of 5 ate at Mulates after being advised it was a great restaurant by the Embassy Suites concierge desk. I was so disappointed. We have traveled all over the world and have tasted many culinary cultures so we had a very open mind. The food was worse than buffet style food. It was cold, and completely un eatable after telling the waitress about our ice cold jambalaya and bisque she never offered to take it back to the kitchen or take it off of our ticket our meal was 198.14 and that was gratuity included because we were a party of 5!! How ridiculous. We could have eaten at Arby's and had a nicer meal. Please do not waste your time here or your money walk down into the French Quarter and choose any other restaurant I promise you will be more satisfied than eating at Mulates.

"This is exactly what street food in Tucson should be like.  The menu points you to the obvious choice: a ""New"" Karamelo King ($4.50) complete with cheese, cabbage, grilled onions, beans, avocado slices, and either carne asada or chicken.  I got mine with carne asada, and...well...wow.  Everything about it was amazing.  I paired my caramelo with a cold bottle of Mexican apple soda ($1.75 -- regular soda is $1), stopped by the little metal condiment cart for some toppings, and sat down at a shaded plastic table to relish my tiny feast.  Simply awesome.  I was only there for a mid-afternoon snack, so the caramelo was just enough to satisfy me.  But if I had been coming for lunch or dinner, I probably would have also liked to order a Sonoran hot dog (just $2.50), which they apparently do quite well here.

"Solid 2 stars. My husband and I were staying at the Ritz last weekend and decided to have dinner here. We have stayed at various ritz hotels and have enjoyed all of their steakhouses except for this one.  Everything started beautifully. The restaurant is lovely as well as the hostess however the moment we were seated everything took a downward spiral. Our waitress was extremely inattentive. She began to take our order 10/15 minutes after being seated. We began ordering and I expressed to our waitress  that I was expecting and will need to have my steak cooked all the way through (well done). Anyways... our appetizers arrived and they were good then our dinner arrived and so did the downward spiral. My steak was cooked at medium temperature, granted this was an error on the kitchens part but there was NO waitress for me to voice my undercooked steak. I ended up eating the very edges of the steak (trying to be cautious with my pregnancy). Finally, our very busy waitress made an appearance as we were already done with our dinner. She quickly asked how everything was and my absolutely red steak was completely visible to her. I told her well my steak is noticeably undercooked and she then said oh, can I get you another. At this point it was already too late and I did not care to have another. I asked the waitress if she was our tables waitress because we had barely seen her and she told me yes, I've had 2 large parties and have had to tend to them. Soooo you're basically telling me that we were not as much of a priority as your larger tables? Are we not paying as much? Anyways, she then took our plates and we sat there for another 10 minutes wondering if she would be back to ask if we would like dessert. My husband literally had to flag her down and tell her we wanted to order dessert only this time I asked her if things would be done in a timely manner because I needed to get back to our room to take my timely medication, she said yes. We also asked for the bill to come with our dessert. Our dessert arrived and no bill. Are you serious?! I just finished explaining that I have to take my  medication in a timely manner and we need the check right away. I was sooooo done at this point. I left the restaurant and on my way out asked her to bring the check.   After my bad experience with my undercooked steak, a manager should have been notified by our waitress in efforts to help try and improve our dining experience. I don't need things to get comped but if you make a mistake and you have paying customers treat them kindly. Apologize, don't tell us you had 2 other large parties and put us on the back burner. Lastly, if your table notices your absence try to make an effort and be more attentive! Respect our time!  This was a $300+ horrible experience. We could've gone to a drive through and gotten better service! Sorry the service was just not at a Ritz restaurants level.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"You know..a lot of people are really impressed with the Ball and Biscuit, and I can honestly understand why.   The place is beautiful. The people (for the most part--I mean, I was in there significantly bringing down the average!!) are beautiful, and the drink selection is incredible. Plus, the name is GENIUS! I won't ruin the story behind the name, but it's definitely unique. Just by LOOKING at the menu (which includes everything from drink combinations I've never heard of to cheese selections that I've never heard of) you can tell that this place is top notch.   However, for the same reasons people love this place I'm simply not that impressed.   I'm admittedly an average joe. I like what I like, and I don't intend to overpay for it--unless there are extenuating circumstances, like the going away party of a dear Yelper (as I pour my proverbial drink!)  The Ball and Biscuit is not for the average Joe's. I really cannot fathom regularly paying $4 for a BUDWEISER! WHERE.DEY.DO.DAT.AT?!

"I should have known better with a menu this size (Over 100 items) that the meal we were about to embark on would be satisfactory. We received the menu under our door about a week ago and my manfriends was drooling ever since about the new sushi cuisine in the neighborhood not to mention that it also served Chinese food.   So last night we dove in... About $50 worth of Japanese & Chinese sub-par cuisine and we were mildly disappointed.   First up the salad that came with both of our meals: The lettuce was brown around the edges and the dressing wasn't the typical asian dressing that we normally experience when we order  Japanese cuisine. My man happened to like - I say this was the best item beside the Miso that came with my meal.   On to the main course: I ordered Teriyaki Shrimp. It came with about 10 Jumbo Shrimp (A+) however it seemed like it was deep fried rather than over a grill or hot plate. . It was covered in some sort of flour batter that was crispy. The vegetables consisted of a whole lot of onions and 2 pieces of broccoli. The sauce was lacking and there wasn't enough in the to go box. For the same price I could have whipped this up for me and the man & taste the same. I wanted to like, really I did. The rice was good!  My manfriend ordered Sweet & Sour Chicken HOWEVER the missed the main ingredient: Sweet & Sour Sauce. So here it was, deep fried chicken bits, no sauce = Angry manfriend. He is on his way back to the restaurant now to pick up a side of sauce so he can enjoy his meals at lunch today...

"One of my favorite restaurants in all of St. Pete. This hidden gem is a bit off the beaten path (Pasadena) but is well worth the trip from downtown. The menu may not be extensive, with pages and pages of options but the items included are top notch.  Personal favorite is the Bahn Mi sandwich, I prefer the grilled pork with an egg and served spicy (not really that spicy). This sandwich is an inexpensive option that never disappoints. The crusty bread and fresh vegetables are a perfect compliment to the meat and leave you feeling full but not heavy.  Another great item is the Au Gratin Potatoes. These are a side dish that accompanies the short ribs but I have ordered them as a side for other meals because they are just so delicious. The sliced layers of potato almost seem like art and the sauce is a great compliment.  Alesia, with its great menu, affordable prices and warm atmosphere (French country house) is a perfect date night destination or a relaxed option for a group looking for a quality meal and overall experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"It's hard to find a reason NOT to give this place 5 stars. It's tucked away amongst the historic Meridian houses giving it an instant charm. Inside is warm and cozy with a log cabin-like feel. I went with my family for my dad's birthday on a Sunday night, and only a few other tables were taken throughout our entire meal. Our waiter was knowledgeable and timely. We started with the fried oysters which were actually delicious (coming from someone who doesn't like fresh oysters). I had to get the smoked corn purée soup bc so many reviews raved about it, and it was definitely worth it!  For my entree, I took the vegetarian route and got the roasted cauliflower alfredo, which was tasty. Other meals at our table included the Duck Breast, Miller's Chicken, and the Pork Trio. I gotta say, if I were to go back I would get the Duck Breast. It was SO GOOD. The soft boiled egg on top of the soba noodles with the soy-mushroom broth was just so flavorful and delicious. For dessert I think between the 5 of us we almost got every option including the donuts, pumpkin creme brûlée, pecan pie, chocolate mouse layered dessert, and the vanilla ice cream (yes, I'm that boring person), and everyone liked them! The pumpkin creme brûlée was my favorite and definitely worth a try on the fall menu.   Overall, I would love to come back in another season to try out a different menu (they change with the seasons besides a few staples like the corn purée).

"I had brunch here today. Ordered the carnitas skillet.  It was really quite delicious but a little spicy so if you don't like spice avoid it. Otherwise,  it's an A+.  However, the star of the meal were the pancakes  They were lemon, poppyseed pancakes. They were fluffy and by far the best pancakes I've had in a restaurant.  I didn't order them but had a bite of my daughter in laws.  They will be what I order next time. You can get them as a side for your skillet which is the best of both worlds.  I however ordered sourdough bread as my side because I usually don't like restaurant pancakes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"First off the wait time is ridiculous. It took us an hour to get seated. Once we got the text our seat was ready, we went up to the hostess, and she sat us outside! It was literally 95 degrees outside. The entire meal was miserable because it was so hot. They should've given us the option when we put in our reservation for inside/outside. I didn't want to wait any longer, so we just dealt with it. The waiter was slow and everything took forever. The food was mediocre. We got an elaborate shake and it wasn't even enjoyable because of the heat. The staff was also unfriendly. It's sad because I follow them on social media and after this experience I will not be back nor recommend it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Major convenience factor if you work in the building, but no real reason to come here if you don't (and they're only open during regular business hours). The bagels are nothing to write home about. Sometimes they're really chewy. Salads are decent, sandwiches are disappointing.   Solid ""meh"" overall. Everyone in my office grumbles about the place, and yet we all keep going back, because, well, it's right there. We're a captive (and lazy) audience.

"Love the atmosphere, food was good....not outstanding....but good.  Prices were a bit off to places of the same style.  Wife ordered a shrimp cocktail....4 medium sized shrimp, priced $17.  We questioned the price when it arrived since they were rather small.  I ordered the Shrimp and Crab salad, which was $24....same 4 shrimp of the same size plus a good helping of crab, a good sized salad...price seemed ok for the size.  So unless you like high priced shrimp cocktail, order the salad.   On another note:  Staff needs to be trained in etiquette!!!!  We are here from out of state visiting family, so when I went to pay with my credit card, it was declined do to being over 1,200 mi from home (Chase bank has great security)...not an issue....but how our waiter handled it blew my mind.  He walk up to about 4 feet from the table and very loudly said ""Your card was declined, do you have another."" That is NEVER fun!  Ludwig managers, teach them better.  A simple calm voice directed at me rather then the room would have been a better approach!~  I heard great things about Ludwig's, and our family here in town love it.

"Staying in NOLA for my old Marine reunion and wanted to try this spot after walking past it for several days. I will get the negatives out the way first....no seating in the waiting area, where most places have a few seats especially for a long wait time they had none and being disabled it's sometimes a must for me, they dont take discover and didnt notice a sign stating that, the last thing is no sweet tea...this is the south it should be a staple but it wasnt a deal breaker. Most places serve rolls, here you get red potatoes which they dig from the bottom of the seafood boil pot, they are soft and got a bit of a spice to them...super tasty Got the char grilled oysters which were good, having tried them in places over the weekend they add parmesan cheese on theirs which I liked and they are swimming in garlic butter. I decided also on a crawfish poboy and good gosh it was the most overloaded poboy I have seen, the crawfish were awesome and the bread was perfect..now when I go to another place for poboys out of NOLA I am setting myself up for disappointment.

The manager offered round of drinks and we begrudgingly moved, however, it was extremely rude and very poor customer service! We complained to the manager and he gave us a $50.00 gift card .Clearly, this restaurant works off the 'good ole boy network'.

"I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. We were a party of 7. Our table was ready and we were seated promptly. Our service was exceptional. Coleen attended to our every need and executed everything to perfection.  Our first course was spectacular. Everyone in our party enjoyed their order, from the large wedge salad, to the succulent and meaty crab cake, to the Manhattan clam chowder. Our meals were served as ordered. I had the juicy bone-in ribeye and my husband the duck.  My brothers had T-bones and  my father had the filet and lobster tail. My SIL had the mahi and my picky teen niece had the fried shrimp. Everyone was overly satisfied with their selections. The carrot was amazing. Almost like a sweet potato and so HUGE! Someone in our table described it as Christmas bundled in a carrot. Our side dishes were creamed corn and roasted Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were savory and wonderfully caramelized.  The chocolate cake was enormous and so was the coffee was aromatic and delicious.  I find this establishment superior to Flemings in everyway.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"So it went down like this. I, like apparently every other tourist who wants to have ""real"" fried chicken, found Willie Mae's and set off on my quest. It is not common, in fact specifically advised against, to walk the 2 miles from the French Quarter to this location, but I went for it. What I didn't know was that Willie Mae's is a lunch place, and I got there about thirty mintues after they closed. Sweating like a pig, I asked the guy who was locking Willie Mae's down what my chicken options were, and he directed me to Dookie Chase a block away.   I guess that's not the best way to say I found it, but in I walked and, of course, their restaurant was closed too, but they had take out, phshew! I ordered a three-piece meal with string beans and yams, and walked another mile back to the park bordering the Quarter to have my hard won meal.  What I tore into was absolutely the best Southern fried chicken I've ever had. Holy effing moly, did I savor every last bite! The string beans and yams were like grandma used to make, truly, the taste memories just flooded back.   So in the end I'm glad I made the walk (though I wouldn't recommend it), I'm glad I got turned away from Willie Mae's (though I wouldn't recommend it), and I'm so SO glad I got to try the great Dookie Chase (which I wholeheartedly recommend).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

None of their dollar/value menu. They're also cash only...or they were atleast when I was there around 2:30ish before a much-needed trip to Fresh Grocer. I always carry cash and my card, but, I can see how this can cause chaos in the store. Especially, when you have like 25 drunk college kids in line.   Don't even let me get started on them...I am 23 years old before I come off as an old fart, ""Get off my lawn.""-type. I party...even rave. I embarrass myself and do stupid shit.

We got the lunch buffet. The salad was fine with an assortment of dressings, and that's the best of the entire meal. The gumbo was more like a chicken soup, no roux at all and didn't have any resemblance of a gumbo flavor. The jambalaya consisted of red rice, no meat, just red rice. The red beans and rice couldn't have been more bland and the chicken was just ok. The peach cobbler was sweet, not good, just sweet.

We arrived a little before 5pm and were informed they don't start serving the dinner menu until 5:30pm but we could sit in the bar area for drinks and they serve the bar menu.   They have a decent beer menu for craft brews but the ""bar menu"" is extremely limited to items that I wouldn't even consider bar food and barely snacks. Cheese plate, charcuterie plate, grilled octopus, a wedge salad and foie gras. Come on. I mean I'm not expecting wings and tater tots but something a bit more substantial with cocktails and beers? Luckily the very last item on the bar menu is a burger that comes with fries and it was delicious so that redeemed them. Their green herb sauce gave it the perfect cooling effect to the pepper and it was a filling burger without making you feel like you had the itis.

The food was delicious,prices were very fair,service was very good and friendly,the establishment clean.  Some tourists have found the place but not like in the Quarter.  I had the fried kibby: loaves made with cracked wheat and ground beef crush,stuffed with spiced ground lamb,onions and pine nuts. Hummus to dip it in. MMMMM!! My girl friend had the half and half: chicken shawarma and lamb. Hummus to dip it in. MMMM!! We both had their salad and it was very fresh. On the side we were given pita bread. To drink we tried the Lebanese tea,iced. It has the scent of roses and the taste too!! Pine nuts were drizzled in with it. Very different but tasty. For desert we had the burma,it's shredded wheat in a roll stuffed with pistachios and honey. I couldn't eat enough it was soooo good.

The only thing keeping this from a full 5 stars is we ordered our meal to go and my burger was supposed to have the Benton bacon on it (it was 2 dollars extra, but very much worth it).

One of the omelettes came WITH cheese spefically when it was ordered without because of allergies. The person who ordered decided to pick off our plates because she didn't want to wait another 30-45 minutues for another plate.  The food was not very good, especially for that WAit!!

The first things I saw on the menu here that was a giant red glad we're options for 12 and 16 ounce cappuccinos. Any self respecting coffee lover knows that is an affront on good coffee. They did have a ton of options for pour overs but my cup was obviously a dark roast (another affront IMO) and there was nothing on the menu to suggest there were different roast levels. There may have been light and medium roasts that were not indicated so I will give them the benefit of the doubt since there were about 50 different single origin and blends to choose from. The space is relatively large, open, inviting, and unique. They didn't mind that I was obviously there to camp out with my lap top and the staff was all around very friendly.

"We haven't been here since taking our daughters back in the early 2000's. Today we took our grandchildren. The place has been completely revamped. This is nothing like the old Chuck E. Cheese. It is so much more open, brighter, cleaner just all around a totally different experience. I think the price is reasonable considering all the things kids can do here and they don't gouge you. For example, on their site you can get a coupon code for a discount package and food package. Always choose the minutes option because it gives you unlimited access to everything, which comes in handy for little ones who prefer the rides over and over. You only pay for the kids. And you can pause your time at the kiosks for breaks, eating, etc. so it's a full hour or two of play. They have a stamp system that ensures your little ones only leave with you. Just peace of mind. The lady at the counter when we entered was helpful since we haven't been in years. She let us know the food took about 45 minutes to an hour (busy Saturday) so we should go ahead and order now then play for a while. They give you a little buzzer for when your food is ready. Just go grab your table and start playing. They have nice roomy booths and tables everywhere. You can buy wristbands for your play cards and cute little drink cups for the kids. There are a ton of rides and the games are really fun. In fact we wouldn't mind going back without the grandkids. You get free refills on drinks. The table was clean, the pizza was good, even the bathroom was spotless when we went despite the large crowd. To top it off, when we cashed out our tickets and the kids were picking prizes, my granddaughter had only 80 points left but wanted something that was more than she had left. The guy working the counter heard her say what she wanted and said it was fine, she could have it and gave her the ball along with one for my grandson. I just thought, ""This place really gets it.""

"Great variety of burgers with or without ""exotic"" meat and my 8 year old is obsessed which may be the only thing keeping us going back.  The lady at the register was friendly, quick and efficient without rushing us. However, the other employees were playing around, laughing, ignoring and having their own party behind the counter.   I am NOT opposed to making the work place a fun and happy environment. However, in the process they had to redo at least TWO orders while we were there alone. At one point I went to the counter to ask for some ranch and a to-go container and patiently waited a couple of minutes before finally getting their attention.   The burgers and onion rings are delicious! The fries are unfortunately over salted. Next time I will probably just ask for no seasoning and salt them on the side on my own. They're the potato wedge kind which are delicious, just slightly over seasoned.   I only gave 3 stars because as you can read it's such a hit or miss between the experience and the food. And I'm not just about food or experience.. I like a balance.   We have been here before and have had similar experiences so I feel pretty fair in giving a 3 star review. Even with the 3 stars, the flavor and options will most likely keep us returning for now.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This is the Boston Pizza location that I'm most likely to frequent. I've been visiting for well over a decade now and while the staff has been varied over the years, I've enjoyed visiting here at various times of day for various reasons. My most recent visit was during the early afternoon for Boston Pizza's 50th anniversary because of their $5 pizza promotion (which was indeed just $5! I did tip, of course as my service was great).  In the past I've visited in the late night after ballroom dance events, late morning for an early lunch and every time period in between on weekdays and weekends for gatherings with friends, alone or on a date. And while the food is the standard fare that all Boston Pizza locations have, this location is fairly consistent with service. I tend to get better service in the restaurant section (and I use this area more often) rather than in the lounge, but I've definitely visited both.  I like the fact that Boston Pizza is a good place to go and relax over a meal or drinks or snacks, or dessert for a few hours and not have to be terribly rushed, but where you can get in and out in an hour or less if need be. The patio is nice on a summer day as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Been here a few times with the family because one of my uncles lives in the area. 'Cause when you're in Philly, you gotta have a cheesesteak. It's a mandate in my opinion. The cheesesteak hoagie is a bundle of aromatic tastiness. Being that most times we drive back with the sandwiches to NYC, they hold up real well as road  food. The prices are slightly on the steep side. Also, be prepared to spell out in full detail exactly what you want, how you want it. Interestingly enough, Cosimo's is also where I gained a deep appreciation for Herr's potato chips, notably their Ketchup flavor.

"Hmm. I wasn't overly impressed, but it wasn't THAT bad, either. Pricier than I thought it would be for sure...my family and I shared one side dish because they were $3-4 each. I had the bacon BBQ burger. It was good, I guess, but it didn't knock my socks off. I got the smaller sized patty because I was afraid of the half pound. Bad decision. Burger was pretty thin. I can't decide what to think about the service here...is a waitress who comes to the table practically every 5 minutes or more a good thing or a bad thing? She seemed to come slowly when we actually needed her and show up constantly while we were eating our meal. Something about this place annoys me...but I can't really figure out what it is..probably a combination of the wait and the price. You can tell it's pretty new though. I'd give it time before really saying that it is bad or good. It's kind of floating in the middle.

"This place was authentic, but that does not mean it was good.   The atmosphere was bright, loud and claustrophobic.  Tables were much to close, not only left to right but front to back.  Just walking through the place was an uncomfortable experience.  The drink menu was overwhelmed with Margaritas made with vodka.  That seemed an odd choice for authentic Mexican.  We each ordered one, they arrived at our table about 25 minutes later (after I asked the waitress about them).  They were not in my opinion good.  We ordered guacamole which came in a tortilla shell that was stale, the accompanying chips were also stale.  The guacamole itself was uninspired but passable.   Dinner arrived and it followed the quality of the rest of the meal.  The meet in my dish was rubbery and tasteless, the sauce was very good, but the flavor did not translate to the rest of the dish.  the place was so cramped and the tables so small it was hard to eat.  I have been told this is a good lunch place, I think they need to learn the difference of expectations between lunch and diner.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The lamb (seco de cordero) was incredible and fell right off the bone. Tenderloin tips (lomo saltado) were equally tender and delicious. Duck confit (arroz con pato) with cilantro rice was flavorful and mouthwatering. The restaurant is cozy and romantic and perfect for an intimate meal. You can also sit outside under a string of lights although it is next to the driveway so I personally preferred the inside. But we saw lots of people sitting outside.

"If you're in MontCo, there's always Cheltenham Avenue and Elkins/Melrose Park. If you're in Philly, there's Chinatown. But the white bread, socks-and-sandals crowd of Bucks County relies on this Korean grocery chain as a rare source of flavor in a mayonnaise-flavored desert.  Okay, that's probably unfair, but it's really life-changing to have a place like this 15 minutes from my house. H-Mart is a Korean chain, but carries Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino products as well. Their produce is cheap (They *actually* know how to sell starfruit at a reasonable price here), and their meat selection is great,  That being said, this particular location is a bit small for an H-Mart. There's no fish balls, there isn't a lot of hot food, and there isn't a bakery (most places will either have a separate Tous Les Jours or Paris Baguette location). But compared to anything else in Bucks County, it's special.  In sum, H Mart is the best of what Bucks has to offer.

"For the price (~$25/per person for dinner, not including drinks, dessert, etc.), this Brazilian steakhouse can't be beat! The servers were all very attentive (and, dare I say, friendlier than the much pricier competition in Tampa) and the atmosphere was very casual.  While it is not the best quality, the food is tasty and the presentation is excellent. The salad bar had a fair selection and just about everything I had was good. As for the reason you come to this kind of steakhouse...   I was not a huge fan of the lamb (too tough, though the marinade was delicious), the sausage (not bad, just not for me), or the garlic steak (overdone). On the other hand, the ribeye, sirloin and ribs were out of this world! The kabob sirloin was also very good. The portions and selection were great and a good value for the money.  For dessert, we tried the cheesecake, tiramisu and the chocolate mousse. All of them were very good. The coffee was very strong--I recommend skipping it and having something else to drink.   Overall, I strongly suggest this restaurant for those with an appetite who love a variety of meat and a casual atmosphere.

I didn't see many choices of sauces, maybe I missed it, but all I saw was marinara and olive oil. I saw a variety of cheeses but didn't know which one was which, server just assumed mozarella. The topping that could be added is fresh spinach. I saw a cooked down option of it but didn't look good.

"I dined here for the first time since the place re-opened recently. The interior looks well, and there is plenty of parking. However, the only other positive remark I have is that the salsa was excellent. It was a little spicy, but not enough to drive away the average mexican food consumer.  The tortilla soup sounds so endearing when you place the order, but it was honestly a mystery soup. I think I could identify two or three ingredients in it, and I was happy I couldn't identify the rest. Needless to say, I wasn't keen on it. I ordered a steak and chicken chimichanga as the main course, and one would figure you couldn't ruin a consistent heart throb in a fried shell. Lo and behold, they did. On top of splattering a guacamole sauce (I think that's what it was) all over half of the plate, they filled the chimi with a mystery cheese sauce. It was sweet and tangy and reminded me of that one time I ate a jalapeno while chewing gum... disgusting. The service was decent, and we didn't have to wait at all (on a Wednesday night). I'd probably give it another try but would definitely avoid a repeat of that order.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Delicious, spicy, great flavor profiles.  I ordered the vegetable fresh rolls, wonton soup and lamb (ground pork) salad.   Wow. As one always hopes for with Thai food, the flavors danced on my palate and invigorated my senses.   The fresh rolls were expertly rolled, rather large, and the veggies were balanced. The spicy sweet sauce was much better than many other restaurants which often tend toward a super sweet syrupy sauce. This one was tangy and of a thinner consistency. Loved them.  Wonton soup. I would not usually order a dish typically associated with Americanized Chinese food from a Thai restaurant, but boy am I glad I did. I was intrigued by the description on the menu which described a wonton soup with fish sauce, cilantro and bean sprouts...soundly very Thai-like in nature. It did not disappoint. The broth was delicate in flavor and complemented by the meaty chicken wontons. There was no doubt that this tasty soup was a Thai inspiration.  The larb salad was the highlight of the meal. Fresh and crisp cabbage, thinly sliced red onion, crunchy peanuts and sliced green onion balanced with the ground pork, fish sauce and lime juice to make one of the best larb salads I've had the pleasure of eating. I enjoyed being able to get it Thai hot, and it was that. Not overly seasoned, but a balanced spice to still bring out the key flavors of the dish.  All at a reasonable price point: $4 rolls, $8 salad and $4 soup.  I will definitely be ordering from here again.  (I was super hungry and forgot to take pictures first...my bad.

"Visited for the first for my wife's birthday. It was...OK.  Service: All of the staff were extremely welcoming and friendly. But, our table service was very slow at the beginning of our meal but improved as the night went on.  Example: we ordered appetizers and the appetizers were delivered and we were finished eating them before our entree order was taken.   Food: Overall very good, but some small issues with things being cooked properly. My wife had steak and lobster; a portion of the lobster was so under cooked that she did not finish it.  I had a filet that I ordered medium; half of the steak was medium, the other half was extremely rare.  It was not cooked evenly throughout.  We ordered a side of potatoes au gratin and the potatoes were crunchy - again undercooked.  On the positive side,  the steaks were very tender and had a good flavor.  Atmosphere: this was probably the biggest disappointment.  The restaurant is located in the lobby of an office building, and it feels like you are eating in an office conference room. Grayish office carpeting, off white walls, metal framed windows that overlook the highway.  Just wasn't what we expected.   Overall: very friendly staff, most (but not all) of the food was good, atmosphere needs to be improved.

The reason for my 2 stars is the actual service. Our waiter and front staff was friendly. But, the service felt very rushed we were asked over 5 times if ""we were done with that"". Our food had just arrived. At first I thought wow this is the best service I have had they are so attentive but, in reality as it continued all I could assume was that it was because they wanted to clear our table for the people coming in late for the bar part of the Welcome Diner. It was so uncomfortable to the point my friend was about to take a bite of her food while she was eating and, they asked her ""are you done with that? Can I take that out of your way?""

Found this gem on Yelp right across the street, with nobody waiting (must have timed well, as it was a little busier when I left). It's been there 37 years, so a bit of a legend in its own right. Cheesesteak was outstanding, with a fresh and chewy roll, well cooked and flavorful beef, and many fixings to choose from. They have only 4-5 bar seats, so dining in for a family might be tough.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"We visited Deanies for lunch with a veterans organization during our recent trip to New Orleans. We loved the decor, which had the vibe of a 1920s eatery. Our first glitch occurred when the staff declined to seat my husband, who was wearing a sleeveless shirt (the temperature outside was close to 100 degrees and we were winding up a guided tour). The sleeveless rule didn't apply to women, so I offered to exchange shirts with my husband or walk back to our hotel (about 5 blocks away) for another shirt. Instead, they gave him an extra large T-shirt to borrow. (So folks, take note - no sleeves, no service for guys.) We understand why the restaurant has a dress code, but in this instance, where they were singling out one person from a large, mostly out-of-town, older, and sober group on a very hot day, it would have been sensible to bend the rules. Now for the food. We heard great things about this restaurant, including that it was a locals' favorite. Others in our company ordered lunches that looked great (shrimp po'boys, seafood over salad, and a bloody mary that was topped with a huge shrimp with the head on, which was the talk of the table). Our choices, however, were disappointing in comparison. I ordered a cup of gumbo and a stuffed crab and my husband ordered stuffed shrimp with French fries. A plate of spicy boiled potatoes was placed on the table instead of bread. Interesting, but not particularly complementary to what we ordered. The gumbo arrived with half of a small crab poking out of the small bowl, but it was more akin to a decoration than an edible part of the soup, due to the tiny size. It was a lot of work for a cup of soup! The gumbo was thick and featured an island of rice rising from the small sea of soup. This was my first taste of gumbo in New Orleans. I wondered what all of the swooning was about over this delicacy. (I did sample other gumbo on my visit that excited my palate a bit more.) The stuffed crab consisted of a wad of stuffing in a crab shell. I could barely detect any seafood in the stuffing itself. It was boring to eat. My husband's stuffed shrimp appeared to consist of the same stuffing - there were three modest stuffed shrimp on his plate. At least his shrimp actually had shrimp under the stuffing. So, we were totally underwhelmed by this place and wish we had ordered what our fellow diners did. The difference was like night and day. Unfortunately, we are not rating according to what our companions ordered, we are rating on what we ordered. It is likely that one could easily have a four-star meal here, but we apparently missed the boat.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"The food here is fantastic. If you like Jose Garces, you'll love this place. However, I called tonight after checking 4 other restaurants in my neighborhood that I can walk to & I was told Cantina Feliz had no wait for a table for two.  We arrived within 10 minutes of calling and suddenly there was a 20 minute wait even though no one was sitting in the waiting area.  No problem, we sat at the bar to wait. Over an hour later & being told twice that I was the next table, and watching other couples who arrived after us be seated, I told them forget it, we are leaving. Magically our table was ready & the manager tried to keep us there & buy us a drink, which was nice. We left hungry & pissed.  I don't mind waiting but the only reason we went here tonight was because they told us there was no wait.  I feel like I was deceived into going there with the full knowledge we wouldn't be seated in the time they said. I would have ordered food & eaten at the bar & wouldn't have minded because the food is so great--but no one even bothered to keep us informed about our table. If someone from Cantina Feliz is reading this, please know that your restaurant could be great, but lacks the customer service to push it to that next level.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The mussels were great but the gnudi was very different from the usual preparation - instead of being light and fluffy, the gnude were breaded and heavy.  I was not a fan.  The mussels were pretty good though.  We then tried the monkfish dish and the pork.  The pork was surprisingly light and much better (read: good but not something I'd order again b/c kind of boring) than the monkfish which I thought had a weird BBQ sauce and was too heavy.  I wasn't a fan.  Both desserts, the panna cotta and bread pudding were delicious.  The drinks weren't that great but the service was pleasant enough and the meal did end on a high note.

"Unique in the setting, it's actually inside an old renovated firehouse. It's beautiful inside and fun to eat there! On a nice day you may be able to snag a sidewalk table.  We've dined here several times and we were not disappointed, although there are better places around town, the inside ambiance helps add much to your dining experience.   I had the clam chowder and the barbecued baby back ribs, both were tasty. The fries are hand cut which is something I appreciate and adore. Hubby had a huge juicy burger and was loving it.   The inside is dimly lit with a lot of dark wood inside. A very large bar sits center stage. Another time we sat in the lounge area and enjoyed some good cuts of steak, filet for me and NY strip for hubby, both cooked to the right temperature..     I saw Jack McDavid walking around and said to my server, ""I used to watch him on TV. cooking with Bobby Flay"" and she sent him over and he signed a mini menu for me! That was better than anything.

"The Good: For some reason, the pizza here just seems better than other locations. Never undercooked, a fair amount of toppings and a large will feed 3-4 hungry people.   The OK: Salad Bar gets a lot of activity and is usually well stocked with a larger variety of toppings. It can be a bit messy and towards closing many items are wiped out.  The Not so Good: Of the many times here, the one consistent pattern is what seems to be a lack of appropriate help. The second you order, the first words you are met with are ""so you know, it's taking 45 minutes for pizza's to come out"". The dining room on a weekend night is always in shambles and you can easily count on several irate customers as you languish in long wait times. We've learned to call it in to go and continue doing other things. This is one of those spots that if it stood alone, would fold within a year. The problems are that bad. Now, if it just staffed it with 2 additional employee's when it's busy, this place could make a fortune. Until they figure it out, call ahead to avoid the complete chaos.

I ordered the sidelines burger and mac and cheese for a side. My wife got the country chicken salad. To start they forgot my order so I didn't get my food until about 20 minutes after everyone else so everyone had to watch me eat. They also didn't not offer me anything other than a insincere ""sorry"" for the meal I received so late.  My burger was over cooked and the mayo on it made the whole thing taste very odd. My mac and cheese was also sub par. It tasted an awful lot like a stoffers microwaveable mac and cheese. My wife's salad did not come with crispy chicken like it stated in the menu.

This is the most authentic Chinese restaurant we have experienced since we came to Tucson.  I am born and raised in China and this is the best it gets in Tucson for Chinese food.

We placed an order to go, Lemon Feta Chicken and the Rib-eye, the order came out quickly.  The chicken was very moist and juicy, major plus for me!

With all the good I mentioned, and a great beer selection I will be back to give the food another try. With some drinks the bill was $140 plus tip.  Hope this helps. Here's what we had: Ceviche - loved it. Should have gotten two of them. Cajun popcorn - ok, lie calamari  Jambalaya (standard) Iwas really hoping this would have been special.

The breakfast came out quickly and was actually a full plate of food, unusually styled like a lunch. It had crispy mashed potato hash on the side, which was quite good. The croissant was toasted with egg, cheese, bacon, American cheese, tomato, lettuce, and onion with a pickle on the side. The onion was a bit too much for me in the morning so I took that off. Otherwise, it was a hearty meal! Kept me going through my connection till I could eat back home. The coffee was a little dull in flavor, but I wasn't expecting anything more than a diner-style brew.

"We decided on Beachbreak Cafe after reading all of the positive reviews on Yelp.  Boy were we wrong in choosing this restaurant.  We went there on the morning of July 5th.  Granted, many of the workers were probably partying it up in Old Town the previous evening, but they have a job to do.  We arrived around 9:00 a.m.  There were literally only 4 other people in the restaurant when we arrived.  The waitress (a short brunette) told us to sit anywhere.  So, we sat outside right near the door.  She took our order and then disappeared into the restaurant.  About that time, another 8 or so people sauntered into the restaurant.  A new waiter, an older gentleman, rolled into the restaurant at that time.  He then went to help the 8 people, while we just sat there wondering what happened to our order.  About 4 of those people that arrived after us got food before us.  We were confused to say the least.  So, we asked the male waiter if he could get us at least the drinks that we ordered.  He said that he was too busy and that he didn't have time to help us (what?).  Then the female waitress finally showed up with our food (no drinks though).  The wife ordered the french toast that still had raw eggs in the middle of it.  I ordered the breakfast burrito that was good except the liquid that they thought passed for salsa.  So, my wife had to track down the female waitress that was as elusive as a unicorn.  When we finally stopped her (she was darting everywhere except to our table) we pointed out our problem and tried to change the french toast for pancakes.  She said that she would put our order in.  About this time people were coming and going and getting fed... NOT US!!!  Plus, they couldn't even bring us our drinks (WTF).  So, my wife had enough.  We stopped the waitress again and told her to cancel everything except the breakfast burrito that I was eating.  She explained how inattentive and disrespectful she and her male waiter had been.  The waitress was a bit perplexed.  So, she apologized and then said that she wouldn't charge us for anything (that's pretty classy).  In the end, I can say that the breakfast burrito was good (flavorful even).  However, the service was so haphazard and uneventful, that I cannot recommend this restaurant.  It is likely that this was just one of those days, but you should never treat a customer like a used tissue (especially when we did nothing to spark eerie in anyone).  Normally, this would warrant 1 star, but because they gave me the breakfast burrito, I'll give them 2 stars.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Hopefully they will learn from our experience. First sign of trouble - walked in and were seated in a back corner and we asked to be moved. The person seating us said ""Open Table controls which table we get, they cannot change it."" They had at least 5 other open tables of equal size - Should have walked out at that moment. Over 10 minutes and no one greets us, finally a server comes over and says ""I'll be right back, need to check on my other table"". Should have walked out at that moment. Requested a different server and this was granted - the server was nice and did try to improve the experience, even giving us a free pizza since our appetizers hadn't arrived in over 60 minutes - should have walked out at that moment. The owner stopped by several times and did try to make amends. He was actually really charming and I feel bad for their issues at this time. At 90 minutes, we received a second appetizer and one entree ( the entree was well under cooked and the app was swimming in oil - clearly rushed by the kitchen). This time we did leave. They accommodated with a discounted bill and a free pizza. The meatball app, salad, and pizza were really good - a glimpse into what this kitchen can produce.

When I arrived for pick up, they had upped the price by a few dollars! I was told it was because of more than 3 toppings. When I pointed out that there were 2 toppings covering the entire pizza, and then a split where it was 1/2 of one topping and another 1/2 of a different topping still equals 3 toppings. She had to get the manager. The manager then told me it was because I had ordered 1/2 side with Anchovies (trying to eat ""better"" ). I said that should have been disclosed when I ordered. I walked... they did not hold up to their end of the bargain and did not inform me of the increase of price on the phone! I would have been ok if I knew ahead of time of the extra charge, or would have ordered different toppings.

And almost hit me with the plate multiple times. It took me 3 times asking the waitress before I got my drink. Then she wouldn't refill it. And when I finally got the drink it was awful.

"The food served at Coast isn't very good at all.  Too bad, because I found the restaurant decor and service quite nice.  For a Thursday, the restaurant was empty.  Only 3 or 4 tables being served.  It turns out, they are empty fairly often.  I can understand why.  Not like we needed it, my gf made reservations.  We ordered cocktails first.  My cocktail was something with blueberry.  Can't remember what it was called but it was DISGUSTING!  Now my server did warn me that my drink was ""sweet"" beforehand.  He noted that diners have asked to send it it back because of the sweetness.  I've had sweet drinks before... how bad can it be.  Oh damn, one sip and I nearly gagged.  Sweetness was not the problem, it tasted like cough syrup mixed with alcohol.  BLECH!  I couldn't drink anymore of it.  On to the food: only positive thing I have to say are the prices.  Reasonably priced if the food was better.  Crabcake: dungeness crab, poquillo peppers, citrus salad, smoked paprika vinaigrette.  Now to be fair... it wasn't bad.  I like the fried crispy breading and flavor.  It just lacks crab meat.  Too much breading and not enough lump crab.  Chicken Tortilla Soup:  I got a big heaping bowl of avocado, chicken, poblano chiles, cheddar cheese and tortilla strips.  Probably my favorite dish of the night... and that's not saying much.  Nice chunks of chicken and avocado.  Soup was hearty and savory.  It had this bitter aftertaste that I didn't like at first.  Taste similar to mole sauce.  After several spoonfuls, I got accustomed to it.  Braised Lamb ravioli:  Braised lamb meat inside a ravioli with chantrelle mushrooms.  I hated this dish.  I knew this would be a hard dish to get right.  I was skeptical on ordering it, but it was the only intriguing item on the menu.  First off, the filling inside the ravioli was dried out.  Even though the pasta was thin... it was too chewy.  Maybe too much egg in the dough?  The meyer lemon sauce just didn't work well w/ this dish at all.  Had some bitterness to the sauce.    Diver Scallops: four pan roasted scallops with root vegetable lyonnaise, lemons & peppercorn sauce.  Even though it was nicely seared on one side, the scallops were slightly chewy.  The plating was sloppy looking.  Just a whole bunch of potatoes plopped on the plate w/ scallops thrown on top.  Can't remember much about the sauce... but lets just say that was the first time the both of us ever left a scallop behind.       On another note, we were here for happy hour a few hours earlier.  The $2 tacos (only on Thursday) at the bar was a real treat.  I had a pork and snapper taco... both were equally good.  The snapper was creamy and topped with shredded cabbage and tomatoes, while the pork was garnished simply with fresh pico de gallo.    Also ordered the sliders w/ fries.  The burnt cheese was smart.  Meld every ingredient together (mushrooms, onions, all beef patty).  It was inside a soft brioche bun.  The skinny fries were the best part.... crispy and coated in salt, but in a good way.  It's sad to say the bar food was better than the actual menu.  For that, I gave it two stars.  Otherwise, it would have gotten only one.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

It isn't because of the food, which is good, or because of the service exactly, it was the very impressive lite and confrontational waitress (Danni) who got ANGRY when we asked about something we ordered that was still not ready after two of the three of us finished our meal.

"If there's one thing Johnnie Eats knows its a greasy spoon. This place delivers on that. I've been twice and both times were in the wee hours of the morning. From what I gather that's the best way to do it. Recently, after a night over at Calicos with my buddy Hamshank we headed over and had a Slinger and split 6 of the burgers. The burgers were phenomenal super greasy and exactly what I wanted at the time. I added pickle and onion to mine. Fantastic. The Slinger I was not a fan of. Mostly because of the Chili on top, the eggs and sausage both were tasty but the Chili was a bit bland and needed a little zing to it. It took away from the eggs and sausage instead of adding to it. I added some hot sauce to bring it together but in the future would order something a little more traditional. I get the reasoning behind being Cash only with keeping the allure of the classic diner, but I am always bothered by businesses in 2016 that don't accept debit card payment. If you are looking for a place to grab some late night grub this is a great place to check out in St Louis, I would just avoid the Slinger.  Johnnie gives it three AYYYYYYYYSSSS",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I wish I had taken a picture but I was so hungry I ate the the entire thing in 6 bites. It was tasty, but it was small, and may have had 6 shrimp in it.

Wanting both a sweet and savory breakfast, I got bacon, eggs and a Parisienne pancake (filled with strawberry compote and topped with whipped cream and a dusting of powdered sugar).   This place was packed. Which meant there was a wait for food and I kinda expected that.  We all got different pancakes and shuffled our plates amongst ourselves to have a taste of everything from the pecan to their infamous sweet potato ones (the cinnamon cream syrup is magnificent!)  You're looking at ~$10 for breakfast and I think that's pretty decent. But to wait an hour for that? Not really my jam.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Sakura Springs is a great place to go for Asian cuisine. Delicious food, friendly staff and a nice ambiance. A lot of places that focus on sushi are lackluster in their other dishes and vice-verse- but not Sakura Springs. Everything here is good! I enjoy their sushi rolls very much. There is a station in view where they prepare the sushi, so you know its fresh. I enjoy many of their other dishes too, although its been over a year since I've ordered anything other than sushi and soup here. I almost forgot about this place, since its hidden off the main road. Don't let the outside deter you, upon entrance you will not be disappointed. The decor is very calming and Feng Shui, with relaxing waterfalls, plants, and appropriate lighting.

Chicken and pork were tasty, but I couldn't eat the Singapore noodles. This is my husband's favorite dish, he orders it at all the Asian restaurants we go to. This particular version was very dry and powdery, like they added the spices as an afterthought at the end, though they did give us a very large amount. The pork ribs were very tough, but the flavors were tasty. I would eat here again, but change up my order for sure.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

This was always and I do mean always my go to BBQ place. Not anymore after Friday night 01/27/2017. I spent Friday and Saturday in the hospital emergency room with severe food poisoning from eating one of their pork steaks. It took about 4 hours for the explosive sickness to kick in. Hospital did tests and it was defiantly a case of severe food poisoning. I have all the papers to prove it. Never been so sick in my life...thought I was going to die. It will be a really long time for me to ever think about eating a pork steak from ANYWHERE ever again.

"We headed here for an evening with a bunch of colleagues- and yes we headed here for the music which was really rather good.   The artists were funny and talented although the one that was super young and had the best voice by far, started to grate in the end as every song was about her miserable, angry relationships that failed horribly and sounded like songs one would listen to before jumping off the nearest bridge! But the rest of the songs were enjoyable and the banter between the artists was incredibly funny!! Their guitar playing and voices were amazing.  The drinks were so so and we had been warned that our food would mirror that and it did. Hummus was not good, fried pickles were superb, the table went crazy for the wings. I had a veggie burger and was super excited that they served the 'Beyond Meat ' brand and that - the patty was good but poorly cooked and the  rest of the plate was as bland as cardboard and was left behind.

"Ok, so I would have given it a zero, but there wasn't that option... I am in town for a conference and my friends from the midwest wanted some fresh seafood. I don't eat seafood, but what the heck, most seafood restaurants have something for the non-eater in the crowd. So we got seated right away which was good. But that's where the good ended. I started with a half full glass of water. They brought out 2 very small plates of bread for 6 hungry people. I looked at the menu and noticed that there was nothing without seafood. The only option was a hamburger topped with blue cheese and an oyster. I asked for the blue cheese on the side and no oyster. I will admit, that the hamburger did taste pretty good. The blue cheese wasn't on the plate though. Two of my friends ordered appetizers which never came. Most of the portions were undersized. No one at the table left happy. To top it all off, since we are at a conference we all needed separate receipts so that we could get reimbursed. The waiter said he couldn't do it because they were ""too busy"".   The ambience was the only plus, but the rest of our experience made me never want to come back.
