"I'm just going to put this out there. I don't get it. I kind of get it for lunch, but definitely not for dinner. The price for dinner hibachi with fried rice is obscene. We're talking opening price of $25 for chicken hibachi dinner. In what world?  Yes, I know you are getting entertainment, but call me a party pooper I just don't find it worth it. I will say that the portions are simply huge, too big for one person and don't even think about splitting because you will be punished. Lunch is a different story, the prices are cheaper so if you must I would suggest to go for lunch.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Ive been here a couple of times with family.   This is my go to place for something a little more upscale when we are feeling like celebrating or splurging a bit on money.  Overall they have great presentation, great quality and good taste. Even though it is on the higher end of my budget for dinning out, I always feel like I am getting what I am paying for.  They have excellent wait staff, always checking in to make sure everything is ok.   I am giving it 3 stars, only because I feel as though I have seen other restaurants that really do go the extra mile for costumer service, or have amazing overall value for the price you pay.   The Elephant Bar does great costumer service, but nothing beyond what you would expect at a restaurant at this price range.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Located on the second floor of the hotel, the Sky Terrace has your basic fried food options (calamari, garlic fries, etc) to help satisfy your late night munchies. The calamari comes out in thick strips which were actually super tasty. I also ordered a Bloody Mary oyster shooter because it sounded interesting and I wanted to try it. The oyster in this shooter is not for the faint of heart - it was one of the slimiest, booger looking oysters I've ever had. I ate it anyway, and the bloody mary shot that came with it tasted super potent with alcohol. Not the worst thing I've ever had, but not necessarily the cool experience I was hoping it would be.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I'm not here to talk about the food.  I love Baskin Robbins, I like Dunkin Donuts, this review is to discuss the methods of delivering these tasty treats to me.  First, the drive thru is slow to take your order.  Only one in the line, wait a while.  Get to ordering, a simple order of two scoops of jamoca almond fudge in a waffle cone done twice.  I'm sorry, we only have one waffle cone.  Looks like my wife is out of luck... Just kidding.  I get a shake.  Glad I did, the waffle cone was old and hard.  Pretty sure it was the display from the World's Fair.  Previous time they didn't have jamoca almond fudge.

"We try hard to like this place. They just can't get past three stars. From no one to greet you when you come in to taking too long to get the check at the end of your meal and whatever may happen in between they just fall short.

"Overall 3/5 - Takeout Ramen is such an amazing idea and I wish more places did it. In an area filled with bars, subpar Mexican and cats, it was a breath of fresh air. Black Eye is so small that you could miss it, if not for the lovely ramen mascot artwork outside. The interior decoration is super funky--blue lights, giant bubble-like things on the ceiling and an amazing wallpaper of Japanese rock art. Ordering was a breeze--the menu offers a few choices with traditional or zamen (zucchini noodle) upgrades and additional toppings. I decided to play it safe and go with the basic bowl. The takeout format meant that the broth was in a sealed container, while the veggies, noodle and meat were packed in their own dish, plus chopsticks and spoon.  Ramen: 2/5 - If salt is your favorite ingredient, this might be the dish for you. The broth was much too salty for me to truly enjoy the flavors. Noodles were soft, chicken was dry (boo), but the veggies were great. Perhaps if I paid for a few extra toppings or tried a different broth base, the ramen itself would get more thumbs from me. I'm also curious because the broth is 'iekei' style, but there is not an explicit note about the pork/chicken/soy sauce if they made a truly blended broth (and that can definitely be a health/religion red flag)  I am here for a redemption arc, so I might try some of their other menu options when I'm back in fountain square.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The most admirable quality about any delicious breakfast is its freshness, what a fool I was for ordering anything other than the pancakes. Plenty of people outside waiting to get in, a delightful open and bright atmosphere, and some excellent service. Fresh coffee. Freshly squeezed orange juice before my eyes, I had to have a glass.  But when I ordered the immensely overpriced biscuits and gravy ($11.25), I instantly regretted it. Now, it is a fine moment when your order arrives less than five minutes from your sitting, it is another thing entirely to serve lukewarm hash browns and stale biscuits with warm gravy. I could have gone to Waffle House and saved my wallet a trip to the cleaners. I won't be ruling out this breakfast gem just yet-- I'll just try the pancakes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We ate lunch here and it was okay...not great by any means but decent. Their seafood gumbo is spicy but watery and filled with, what tasted like, frozen, rubbery shrimp. Disappointing for a New Orleans restaurant. My companions enjoyed their food, the shrimp bisque and a muffuletta. However, their mojitos tasted more like sweet sprite with mint than an actual mojito. Stick with draft beer if you dine here. Even though some of the food was lacking, the waitstaff was friendly and helpful.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Food is fantastic. However, I would suggest eating at the restaurant as opposed to ordering for delivery. I have had my order cancelled no less than 5 times since this place opened and the frustrating part is that the restaurant waits until 30 minutes after your order is placed before letting you know the order can't be fulfilled. Again, food is great but they have a long way to go when it comes to customer service and consistency of service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"First off, any place selling itself as Texas BBQ should not smother the meat in sauce. Good BBQ does not come with sauce on the meat and certainly not swimming in it to where you can't taste the meat. This place is ok at best.   I had the three meat...pork ribs, brisket, and hot-link with beans and potato salad. The hot link was good. The ribs and brisket were drowned in sauce. The sauce is tasty, but a bit on the sweet side. But again...good BBQ is about the meat and you couldn't taste the meat. The beans were sweet. A little too much for me, but not bad. The potato salad was good. Overall, just ok. Probably won't go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Really cool atmosphere here. I'd already had about 3 cups of coffee by the time we stopped in here, so we both got the ""Memorial Day Special"" which was a root beer float - although they may always have those. It was just ice cream and root beer, but it was really delicious. The staff was REALLY nice and gave us tips of places to see in the area. I'm not giving it 5 stars because, at the end of the day, it's a normal coffee shop. But like I said, everyone was really nice and it was a really cool atmosphere.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
I've only been there once and just thought it was just okay. I will say our server was super nice and the service was pretty good.

"I found Canton 11 on open table and booked a reservation for myself and a few friends on a Friday evening.  Now that I've written that, I realize you probably don't need the backstory ahead of my restaurant experience.  Too late.  We arrived after the typical dinner crowd which is important to know as they were out of a few of our first choices for dim sum.  No worries, good food moves quickly.  We landed on a few other options and patiently waited for the food to arrive.  The service was friendly and the wait was really not that long.  The eats were, well, A-Ok.  The veggie dim sum had peanuts in it.  Really didn't see that one coming and didn't really enjoy it much.  The shrimp roll was good.  The shu mai solid.  One of my friends ended up ordering pepper steak and it was tasty but a bit light on the steak.  I love dim sum but hold it to high standards.  Overall its not that I wouldn't recommend Canton 11, its just that there is much better dim sum out there.  I do believe their other menu options might be a safer bet and may return to give them a go in those areas.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"29th reviewer of Ed's 50's Cafe Meridian, Idaho.  This is my 391st review. A-OK.  They are open 7 days a week and only mornings- early afternoon.  Location is excellent! It's right next to the McDonalds on Meridian Rd., in front of Winco and right off the Freeway. Inside is classically decorated with cars and more vintage 50's theme items such as the iconic Marilyn Monroe.   I ordered the chopped salad and my partner ordered an omelet. The food, to both of us, was meh-- just ok-- nothing to write home about.  The staff was friendly, and it appeared that they have been there a long time because they had a bunch of regulars that walked in the door.   It's worth a stop by-- especially if you're into vintage cars and 50's theme.According to the Yelp photos-- their take on the classic milk shake looks pretty good!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"5 stars for having a kitchen that is open late and does Uber Eats, 3 stars for food.  Overall I'd rate Eureka a 3.5 if I could.  The kimchi burger was extremely salty and oily, making it hard to appreciate the meat flavor and the kimchi.  The meat I could taste was pretty good.  Kimchi burgers can be some of the best fusion food, but Eureka's is not well executed.  The fries were cold and stale, despite the hot burger.  Sneaking old fries in a to go order is some low down dirty dealing!  You know who you are...  The fried Mac and cheese bites were pretty good.  Overall, I was a bit let down by this meal experience, understanding that the food was ordered late on a weeknight when the kitchen is likely slow.  They did get the food ready quickly and Uber delivered quickly.  If you're hungry late at night and you don't want fast food, Eureka seems like an OK bet.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I had the crispy mac and cheese, which were fried mac and cheese balls- and those were just okay. For dinner, I had the roasted garlic chicken pizza. The pizza was pretty good and there was enough to bring a few slices home for leftovers.   They are introducing a new happy hour, but the options seem pretty limited, and the promotion only applies if you are sitting at the bar (which is only about 10 seats).   While nothing in particular was wrong with my visit, I don't think I'll be back again anytime soon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

But then again, the crowd at Ballpark Village wasn't amazing either--- but it'll do for a night out!   Music was alright, but the DJ seemed to have a hard time deciding what genre of music and from what decade he wanted to play, and the switching was a bit abrupt.   Well, at least there was no cover! But when we left around 12:30 (yeah we're grannies who leave once things are getting started), there was a pretty long line of people looking to get in Ballpark Village, and I saw cash exchanging hands, so maybe they started charging cover.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"My husband and I ate here and we were satisfied.  It was busy but our server was GREAT.  We were seated right away and I left for the bathroom.  My husband was kind enough to order my martini which shortly followed.  I wish I cold remember her name but she was an older, over 30, African American woman with the sweetest of demeanors.   The menu has something for everyone, really.  I was looking forward to the delicious soup but when I got it, it was barely warm.  I believe it had avocado cream on the top and when it was microwaved, it became distorted.  Nonetheless, it was delicious.  Our food was otherwise good and filling, negating the need for dinner.  I would certainly not tell you to steer clear of this place because of cold soup, but just the opposite.  Go, eat, drink and get your fill.  For a chain restaurant, I was impressed and would not hesitate to go again if out of town.  I must preface that by saying I do my best to eat local wherever possible.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Came here on a Monday night so it was pretty dead.  Not a bad meal though for $14.99, but not as much variety as I would've expected.  There were lots of meats but not too much seafood. The highlight was the prime rib, very juicy and tender.  The duck, scallops and lamb chops were good.  There were no crab legs, just small pieces of overcooked crab pieces in tomato sauce which was not very appetizing.  The clams were mostly shells since all the meat seemed to have fallen out.  I actually thought the Lodge Buffet at Grand Sierra was better, classier, and had more variety, but all in all, I had a pretty good free meal since my friend's husband paid for everyone's meal with his gambling winnings so I left satisfied.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"First, the good, the employees were friendly and attentive, service was quick.  It's a nice space, clean and inviting.  Now, the not so good. I think our mistake was ordering individual slices at 3 pm, I get the feeling that what happened was they took slices from pies that had been made much earlier in the day and reheated them in the oven which rendered the crust into the texture of cardboard, in addition they had very little sauce and almost no cheese. I imagine if we ordered a whole pie it would have been better in that it would have been freshly baked.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The food, oysters included, is good, but standards are considerably lower than the Metairie location.  The Metairie restaurant gets 4-5 stars, better at night.

"See my review for the Collegeville, PA location. I don't know that they're the same owner, but all of the same product pluses apply; grass-fed beef, aged cheddar, fries cooked in olive oil (not vegetable or peanut oil).  This location is HUGE. There's all kinds of seats; tables, high tops, window seats and it's super bright and airy inside.   This EB has been open for about a month since this review,  and has its own entrance at the Plymouth Meeting Mall. It is behind the California Pizza Kitchen.  Staff when ordering were friendly enough, but seemed to be ""hanging out"" and making noise the rest of the time.   The wait is no longer than the Collegeville location. It takes some time to cook quality as it's not fast food, but fast casual...notice no drive thru.  Our burger buns were stale and the fries under done. We sent back the fries for new ones. Not sure what to do about the buns.   I probably won't be back to this EB anytime soon, at least not until they're over their growing pains, as I found the food not properly cooked and the staff to be unprofessional...you know as professional as you CAN be at a place like this.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The sushi is a little too ricey for my taste but for takeout, it's not too bad.  It's good for what it is- decent food, fast delivery. Try to stick with the classics and you'll be pleased.  One of the dishes I was super disappointed with was their ""Crispy Honey Chicken."" It was one of the most expensive chicken items on their menu and tasted horrible. The only reason I ate it was because it was a $10 dinner and I was very hungry. The only way I could eat it was to smother it in BBQ sauce.

"*Sigh* I really want to like this place, but I've given up. My first experience her was blah. After letting more than a year pass by and having a strong craving for Jamaican food over the weekend, i decided to give it another chance. I mean how hard is it to mess up jerk chicken? Apparently it is. I got two to go plates and when we opened them up I literally wanted to turn around and get my money back. The chicken breast was so dried out and flavorless. I couldn't even understand how they thought that was acceptable to even serve to customers. The rice and peas and veggies were fine but who wants that when ur main attraction is gross? Fortunately my husband went back up there and the staff was nice enough to give us some more chicken. I definitely won't return for it in the future though. On a more positive note, my beef patty was delicious and I would go back to get another one.

"Sadly, this place has gone downhill. The menu lacks luster and it also lacks pastry; at least there is very little offered. There seems to be more concern with serving cocktails than food. The food we did have was decent in a mediocre way, lacking in depth of flavor but certainly acceptable. The service was notably lacking. When the waiter came to take our order, I pointed out the thread, presumably from a kitchen towel or napkin, in my water and asked for a new glass. That request went ignored until I had to ask another server. The waiter also never offered a refill of coffee, although he did bring one when asked. It isn't so much that we wouldn't return. We would; after all the eggs were cooked properly and the vegetables we asked for instead of potatoes were decently prepared. But, we certainly wouldn't rush back and we wouldn't bring friends to this incarnation of what used to be a standout restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
We went to have dinner here last night for the first time. We were told to pick a table that was available. Our server was switched 3 times before placing any kind of order.  We then ordered a Caesar salad and 16inch New York style cheese pizza. The salad came out with VERY brown pieces of lettuce. You could see them as soon as the plate was set down in front of us!

I hadn't tried the desserts until last weekend and I have to say they are pretty delicious. My husband and I split a cannoli and the chocolate mousse cake.

By far the messiest grilled cheese I've ever had, the sandwich had so much potential but unfortunately the flavor was over taken by so much Blue cheese.  It's a really big portion, I'm a good eater but I wasn't able to finish it, good to share with.   I should've done that as I had the worst heart burn after I ate that.

"Finally got to eat here after our first less-than-stellar experience. I thought it was a pretty cool place, though not good for groups of more than 4. We enjoyed the seasonality of the menu and the cocktail menu is so much fun! A menu item I enjoyed was the poutine - it's massive. We also had the squash blossoms special that was absolutely to die for!! Would have given this place 4 stars but for the following: Service is so-so and the cocktails are not consistently made. We ordered the same champagne cocktail from our first visit and it was very different. When we inquired about the difference, our server said the bartender put his own special twist on it - not really what you want to hear. Still think they need to work through some things but for being a vegetarian restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed the food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Came here for Brunch on Sunday. They gave us an estimated wait time of an hour but we were sitted within 45 mins. It was very busy and our waiter didn't come over to get our orders until 10 mins after we were sitted. We ordered the pecan pie French toast, Creme Brûlée French toast and braised short ribs and eggs. I specifically asked that the eggs be cooked thru because I don't like runny eggs. I had the Nutella latte while waiting on the food and my husband had the peach passion fruit bellini. The bellini was disgusting, my husband couldn't bring himself to even drink half of it. I tasted it and it was so bitter, it tasted like old beer and wine. Our food came in, both French toasts were good..not groundbreakingly amazing, but good. However the eggs we ordered were running and our waiter was so busy and didn't come to see how we were doing we never even got a chance to tell her. I did manage to let her know after we were done with our meal but by then I was over it and ready to leave. The staff seemed more concerned in monitoring when the next table would be available and how far along customers were done with their meals. I wasn't impressed with this place and it was definitely not worth the wait. There are just way better places in Philly to eat.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We visited Ruby Sunshine on Tuesday morning, they were relatively busy so we sat at the bar. They are taking COVID quite seriously (social distancing at bar and tables, masks on, sanitizing often) which we appreciate so much.  The service was a bit lackluster for us- took awhile to get our drink order and then awhile again for food order. Our Mimosas were fine. Not great (the juice seemed a bit off) and definitely not worth $10 each. We got the Cochran Beignets to start, I recommend them for sure- very interesting just a little bit on the smaller side.   My husband's entree of an omelet with breakfast potatoes was overall a bit small. He did get a biscuit which was huge and delicious- you can tell they make their biscuits in house! I ordered The Trifecta, which is three of their house Benedict's. All three were delicious and atop of their biscuits, no complaint there! I really loved the one with the New Orleans shrimp- I was surprised how much I enjoyed it!   Overall, for a $65 breakfast (including tip) we felt very ""eh"" about our experience, just a bit too expensive for what we had. With Nashville having so many brunch spots, we'll have to continue to search until we find our perfect one!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"A bustling place at lunch during my recent visit, I can't quite put my finger on the vibe they're trying to achieve.   Partially hippie vegetarian hangout, partially forlorn neighborhood sandwich joint, the overall effect is not unlike the dining room of several of the nearby homeless missions.  The haphazard decor of castoffs and sad houseplants does seem is a bit incongruous with the menu, which one truly might find at some chic little spa. It's an interesting blend of vegetarian and not, but all rather thoughtfully assembled for interest and taste. Soups, sandwiches, salads, designed for office-dwellers who will walk from nearby.   Ordering and receiving one's food is much like at Taco Bell, whereby a series of negotiations may be necessary to help the lugubrious fellow at the counter really understand your desires. The food is quickly prepared, and then they call out to you across the din to come and get it. So be it.  My choice was the Navy Bean soup, which at first glance was rich and beautiful in color. Really, it was picture perfect and the consistency was the epitome of comfort food. I fear that it lacked any flavor to note, which was remedied by the salt, pepper, and a store-bought spice blend at the table. But it would be nice if they would figure out their own spice blend in the kitchen (which really is a corner of the dining room, or are we eating in a corner of the kitchen?).  The salad was standard fare, not at all bad, mind you, but standard fare much like what one would get in the hospital cafeteria. My blue cheese dressing was, I must admit, quite good. I think they make it there, as the chunks of blue cheese were large, and the flavor reminded me of the sort of thing I make at home myself.  My mediocre first experience aside, I likely will be returning. First of all, it's a block from my office, so surely will do in a pinch. That being said, I noticed a fellow diner tucking into an open-faced chicken salad sandwich with broiled tomato topped with cheese. Now that's my kind of lunch!

"I spent most of last week at my sister's house in Claymont and wanted to try one of Rigatoni's supposedly ""famous"" crab cakes. Last Wednesday (02/10), my brother-in-law and I ordered two entrees for pickup: I got the 4 oz. Crab Cake Platter with a Mediterranean salad, and he got the Supreme Crab Combo with a Crab Pretzel. Although I enjoyed my crab cake, I wasn't too thrilled with the Mediterranean salad; I thought I was going to get an actual salad and instead I got pasta salad in an odd-tasting peppery sauce (?). Also, I wasn't too keen on the price. $8.99 for a small-ish crab cake is a bit steep in my opinion. I understand good crab meat can be expensive, but I have a feeling Rigatoni's tends to lean towards the high end of the pricing scale for no other reason than the fact that they have no competition.   My brother-in-law wasn't entirely pleased with his meal. He said it was ""all right"", but then felt nauseous afterwards. He was sick for most of the evening nursing a queasy stomach. My sister tried some of the Crab Pretzel and started feeling sick late that evening into the next morning. Maybe there were some pieces of crab that weren't exactly fresh in that pretzel or in my brother-in-law's meal, but I do know that my crab cake was very good, and the pieces of the Crab Pretzel I ate didn't give me any digestive problems. Still, it's disconcerting that two out of three people who ate something from this establishment got sick.

"Three stars based on good service and ok food. Our server was accommodating and solicitous without being overbearing.  She gave her honest opinions when asked for recommendations and suggested splitting dishes that consisted of large portions.  This is the way to go with the pasta dishes unless you are very hungry. We ordered a Margarita pizza based on the menu blurb ""Voted best pizza in the Philadelphia area"".  Philadelphia must be a sad, sad pizza desert.  I've had better pizza at Bryn Mawr pizza and at Renato's, to name two random Philadelphia-area pizza restaurants.  Heck, I've had better pizza at the I 95 rest stop in Delaware.  It wasn't horrible, but I can't recommend it. I raise an eyebrow when a Caesar salad has tomatoes, but it was ok if you think of it as a house salad.  Just not very Caesar-y. We waited a bit despite having a reservation, but that was because a previous party lingered. Not the restaurant's fault. I would return and give it another chance.

"I visited Nomad Roman for the first time during their happy hour. It's a great deal - personal pies from $6 - $8, cider and beers for $4 and house wine for $5. Not only is happy hour a steal at Nomad, the restaurant is also cute, particularly the back of the restaurant, which has a rustic and comfortable vibe. The hanging lights are a nice touch too!  The happy hour selection was huge although I did not take advantage of the variety. I tried the cranberry cider and ended up ordering 2. I highly recommend - this one was really dry, delicious and easy to drink!  However, my fiancé and I were slightly disappointed with the pizzas we ordered. I got the Trenton Tomato which was fine but nothing exciting and he got the sopressata, which was overly greasy. Sopressata is naturally oily but there must have been additional oil added - definitely unnecessary!

Usually I stick to the beer here, but the margarita was just perfectly sweet, a tad salty and and a bit orangey... more well balanced than the most famous New Orleans margarita spot.  Bartender hit it out of the park on Mother's Day!    The traditional breaded spicy garlic wings were perfect and large as I remember them.

"As a girl straight from Hyderabad ( As South Indian as it gets ), I had high hopes for the restaurant. I genuinely think the place has such high reviews because there's rarely any South Indian restaurants in center city but a plethora of North Indian cuisines at every corner.  To start positive, the chai here is amazing! It feels like you're back in India when they give you the copper cup and saucer. The dosa, however, isn't your standard crispy masala dosa. Although it was pretty good, I've had much much better dosas at places like Sarvana Bhavan. The vadas also weren't fluffy ( the dough was still pretty sticky inside )and had way too many black peppercorns in them. The utthapam was your standard onion- chili utthapam so I would definitely give that a go!  I didn't order any curries so maybe the place is great for that (: overall, a pretty decent place to satisfy a South Indian dish craving. If you want classics though, Edison is your best bet ( north Jersey).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I have eaten at Delmonico 3 times now.  It's my favorite place to grab a steak when considering uptown and garden district locations (excluding Mr. John's).  That's pretty specific criteria.  Point is, I eat at Delmonico for steak.   I am a big fan of the Emeril's restaurants and Delmonico is usually no exception.  Food first.  Red royal shrimp appetizer: the shrimp were cut up and dunked in a red sauce with avocado.  Pretty good.  I was expecting something more traditional but having the shrimp cut up increased the surface area to which the sauce could stick.  I thought this strategy worked well.  4/5  I usually do gumbo at Emeril's restaurants, but I wanted turtle soup.  Strong showing for turtle soup except we were never offered sherry.  Big Jacob was extremely put off.  I don't take sherry in my turtle soup, so I did not care...much.  I still like the offer.  Bone-in ribeye: excellent.  Cooked perfectly at medium rare.  It could have been seasoned slightly more, but still, the flavor was savory enough.  Nice marbling which I took full advantage of.    So that was the food.  Overall, it was a solid 4/5 culinary outing.  Unfortunately, I thought our service was off.  First, our server (John I think) shook our hands on the introduction.  This felt strange.  I felt compelled to rewash my hands before appetizers.  It's not like he was a dirty guy, but let's just say, I would have preferred a fist bump to a handshake.  Or better yet, no contact.  Then, he showed big Jacob the wines and steered him towards some pricey bottles...amateur stuff.  Our water glasses ran dry a few times.  This is rare at Emeril's restaurants.  We always joke that you can't take two sips without someone rushing over to top off your water.  Then, our bus guy tried to pick up my dessert before I was finished.  I was only half way done.  This was not a one bite left, licking the plate kind of deal.  I had way more pie to eat.  I take my dessert seriously.  I will repeat Delmonico because I enjoy the steaks and I like the atmosphere.

It turns out we had actually gone in the side entrance. After getting seated and looking at the menu I did feel that the prices were a little on the high side. I thought that the garlic knots that were brought to us were terrible. They were hard and tough and one bite was enough for me. After getting my salad I have to say that I was pleased when I was served my main entrée. I got the chicken Parmesan and it was an extremely large portion. I liked it and would order it again.

It was trash.. the rice was soo bland no flavor white rice and chunks of lobster thrown in . It was kind of salty . I tried to save it and add soy sauce but nope it just made it more salty . My friend had the Korean beef fried rice and it was really good more flavor than my meal smh . Welp I won't come back for anything but the dumpling ( chicken and ginger dumpling ) if I do go back.. anyways I'm going home with a sad stomach and probably high blood pressure bc of the salty food and my added soy sauce :(,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"It was one of those rare days when I had to come by this way at lunchtime, so I figured why not try Checkers? My impression of Checkers is it's a low-budget fast food joint. Many of the items are just a few dollars, which looks good compared to other fast food places where nowadays, a combo can get up to $8 or $9. Of course, portion sizes are scaled down a bit too, so temper those expectations. This also appears to be a fast food joint in a rough neighborhood, judging by the bulletproof glass at the order counter that leaves only a small slit for the money.  All the aforementioned aside, I didn't have any problems with my takeout order. The food was mediocre and the service was okay but the price was right for what I got. So it was an average experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I was at Mortions last night with some friends for the power hour and  the food was good, my favorite has to be the burgers and the chedder fries. I like the look of the restaurant and I would have to say the ONLY time i would eat there is for the power hour. I would like to try the mini crab cakes the next time i go. You can enter from the mall or you can park in the back and walk in.

"My friend Chris W and I ordered a number of dishes that ranged from just okay to excellent. The Salmon Tataki with Avocado Salad arrived first and it was the best dish of the night. The pieces of seared salmon topped with salmon roe were just a delight to eat. Chris and I felt that the salad could be made into an entrée with just a few more pieces of salmon. The vegetables were all fresh and the ginger dressing was very tasty. Big thumbs up on the salad. The Shrimp Dumplings with Jala Ponzu were the usual dumplings you'd find in every sushi restaurant appetizer menu. My problem with these dumplings is they taste exactly the same no matter where I go, which leads me to believe that they're pre-made and store-bought rather than homemade, but I can't fault Kidari for that since everyone else seems to be doing the same. Our third dish was the Shrimp Tempura with Citrus Chunky Tomato Salsa on Creamy Wasabi Noodles. I like the fra diavolo style angel hair pasta and the shrimp were nicely done. The salsa was okay. It's almost as if this dish has an identity problem. It can't decide whether it's Japanese, Italian, or Tex-Mex. I think the concept is good, but the marriage of the pieces needs a little refinement. Chris had the 1/2 Set Maki Combo with tuna, salmon, eel, and kanpyo fish and I had the Tangerine Roll (Karai sake salmon on top of crunchy spicy salmon and jalapeno with citrus green tea and spicy sauce). The rolls were rather bland. There was very little flavor in my roll. It's almost as if the spiciness of the jalapenos were removed before they were added to the roll. I cannot recommend either one. The positives are the chef makes aesthetically pleasing food and the quality of the fish is very high. I can only imagine that some of the hospital personnel in the area have caused Kidari to tone down their spice levels to a point where they no longer want to take a chance on flavor.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"My bf and I kept walking past Mama Angelina's and every time he would glance inside and say that he should really try them out. Well, when he was getting really hungry, couldn't decide what he wanted to eat, and was beginning to get on my nerves, I had a stroke of genius and suggested he FINALLY try that pizza place we always walk past.   He got a slice of their vegetable pizza and their pepperoni and we sat down in the very typically pared down dining area inside. Between bites he offered commentary - and a bite for myself - about what he thought of the pizza, and I pretty much agree with him. I personally found it extremely greasy, but he didn't mind that. The crust was a good, thin crust, and the cheese was pretty good. Sauce was ok, it didn't make the pizza that much better than other places. He was somewhat disappointed with their prices since we've encountered better deals for similar quality elsewhere. But overall the pizza is solid.

"Had lunch here with the lovely Le Thu last week, and it was the first time I've ever been to Gott Gourmet. We had a pretty late lunch, around 1:30, so it wasn't packed when we were there. The service seemed really slow, but that might be because I got there a few minutes late, so the waitress had already been to our table. Not sure. It wasn't a big deal, because I enjoyed chatting, but eventually I started to think you were supposed to go order at the counter or something.   The sandwich I had (fried catfish club) was fantastic, but I wouldn't order it again. It was too big. This probably doesn't bother most people, but I'm really not a fan of GIANT sandwiches that I can't fit in my freaking mouth, so now that I know it's enormous, I won't try to eat it again. Oh well. I'll definitely keep an eye out for other opportunities to get janko? panko? whatever fried catfish. It's pretty awesome that way.   We sat at our table for a long time, and they never made us feel like we needed to leave. Even a third person eventually joined us after we'd already paid the bill, and the waitress was there right away to see if we needed more drinks. Which was pretty awesome.   Overall, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, since it's on the other end of the earth from where I live. (i.e. It's uptown.) However, I'm really curious about their breakfast, so I want to check it out someday and try their grits. I believe the waitress told me they only do breakfast on Saturday and Sunday, though.

"Went here for dinner last week with some friends and was pleasantly surprised to find this place in the loop!  The three of us shared the chicken kebabs, lamb kebabs and the mixed grill platter.  The food came out on generous plates with the meat on a pita bread and the other half of the plate filled with romaine lettuce and tomatoes and green bell peppers.  I really liked that there was so much green!  Out of the three dishes, I would have to say the lamb was the best - it was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  The chicken, however, was charred and dry and we found ourselves having to layer on a lot of tzatziki (sp?) sauce.  The mixed grill platter came with some beef, chicken kabab and grilled shrimp.  In our opinion.. it wasn't really worth the $17 when compared to the lamb kebab of the same price.  The service was attentive and the ambiance was great.  Still think some of the places on Grand are a little better but this place definitely has the better setting.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

We ordered a variety of items and usually share as a group. We got two appetizers and each ordered a dinner. My favorite thing was the Avocado fries. My least favorite thing was the nachos. The cheese seemed like it was from a can and didn't compliment the good blue chips at all, was greasy to me. My dinner was a small plate the ribs. The sauce was SUPER sweet and over powered the meat.

There was a 45 minute wait and there were a lot more locals looking to come in the city than just all tourists.  The establishment is clean, hosts and manager friendly. We found a seat at the bar and claimed it. The bartenders were both very pleasant, had recommendations and were knowledgeable.  I'm not boozing it now b/c I am preggers but my mom enjoyed their Voodoo Punch (lots o' rum) and me some straight-up iced-t. Exciting, I know.  Charbroiled Oysters were good as well, not overly cheesy/greasy. Salad was decent. Traditional style, nothing fancy.  EVERYTHING IS FRIED. Ugh. NOT what I was looking for. The crabcake was excellent, but the side of fried with a side of fried was not my forte. Crab claws were easy to eat and tasty... for the first two. But again, FRIED. Softshell crab was good but I feel like all the batters were the same on all the products on the crab quartet we ordered instead of having a different style to compliment the different types of crab/parts.

"Holland House is 5 stars on setting and cocktails.    We had several cocktails and they were all excellent.  It was Old Fashioned Thursday so we got one bourbon Old Fashioned at each of the 3 levels. They were all good, but the consensus was that the mid-level one made with Woodford Reserve was the most balanced and best of the bunch.  The food was a mixed bag.  The Grilled Romaine appetizer was delicious.  Great grilled flavor and delicious dressing.  It could have used a bit more acid, so ask for some lemon wedges on the side. Nit pick aside, I would have ordered more, except that I was there to try the burger.  My niece told me that the burger at Holland House was cooked over a real wood or charcoal grill and that it had almost ""too much grill flavor.""  Now that was a challenge.  What the heck is too much grill flavor?  I drooled in anticipation!   I have long held that J.Alexander's serves the best burger in Nashville because of the quality of ingredients AND because they grill it over a wood-fired grill.  I had to see if they finally have competition.  Sadly, the answer is no.    When the burger came it was beautiful -- piled with caramelized onions, a few homemade sweet-ish pickles, and a tiny sprinkling of greens. It was accompanied by some really beautiful fries.    On my first bite of the burger, I suddenly understood my niece's description of ""almost too much grill flavor.""  When she tasted it, she confirmed, ""Yes, that is the flavor, but it is not so strong this time.""  She just did not know how to properly describe the taste.  This is not good grill flavor.  This is the bad, sooty flavor from a burger cooked too close over nasty flare ups on the grill. This is actually worse than the bland, griddle-cooked burgers at the Pharmacy and other places, because the lovely wood-fired grill is imparting a negative, rather than enhancing, flavor.  How did they get the grilled flavor on the romaine appetizer so right, and get it so wrong on the burger? Such a shame.  The fries were really excellent -- maybe the best in town.  Perfectly crisp, with parsley, garlic, parmesan, and just a touch of truffle.  The highlight of the meal.   The Springer Mountain Chicken and Gnocchi was decent, but the sauce was a bit watery.

Spicy Crab (real Crab) roll, Salmon Skin roll, and a large Kirin. Sat at the bar.  Spicy Crab had real crab, so bonus points for that. Roll not really packed tightly, which means it was rushed out.

Yamagobo wasn't old, cucumber was crisp, and salmon skin actually had some good bits of salmon meat on it.   Service was okay.

Luckily, our server quickly recommended a loaded mash potato lookin thing that turned out to be pretty fantastic. Still, the potato was what i wanted. Service was great. Drinks stayed full. Waiter was very funny and made good recommendations. I believe his name is leeland?  We've had him a few times and it always goes well. Hopefully next time they will have thoose potatos.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Since I don't think anyone cares what I think of the food at In-N-Out Burgers (let's be real, everyone in California seems to love this place) I'll describe this location for first-timers.   This In-N-Out is very clean and seems to be well-run, if a bit slow. Around lunch time you should expect a line out to the door, but it's actually two lines with two cashiers so that cuts down on your wait a bit. The drive-through doesn't seem to be any better, and sometimes I drive by at 10pm at night and the drive-through is still 15 cars deep. Check out the secret menu on their website before you go because the menu there is just the bare bones. I also noticed lots of people getting loaded fries with what seemed like meat and sauce on top, but I'm not sure what that's about or how to order it. Oh the mysteries of life...   They have indoor seating as well as a good number of outdoor tables facing the parking lot. Speaking of the parking lot... it's big, but even with the number of spots they have I still see people creating their own spots. Price-wise I think it's really reasonable, and two regular burgers with fries and drinks ran me less than $12 the other day. That's really good.   So what *do* I think of the food? The burgers just don't blow my mind, and even though I VERY much appreciate that they are hand-slicing those potatoes right in front of me the fries seem a bit bland. Solution? Load 'em up like those other folks! If you want the most awesome burgers in Goleta, though, go to The Habit.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This place is okay. Limited beer selection (typical Guinness/ Bass/ Harp... Nothing exciting or interesting).  The food was good. We had the spinach dip with potatoes and it was decent and the Guinness stew which was good but very small for the price.  Maybe I have my standards set too high for an Irish Pub being from Pittsburgh where there are a plethora of great places.  The decor is great, live music (I didn't pay much attention if they were good or not) but the food and the beer just didn't cut it for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"A very pleasant place and I really liked the server, but the food, sorry to say, was mediocre.  I ordered a Sangria, more wine than fruit.  Salad was best part. I got the salad with cheese and apple fritters. The greens and dressing were nothing special. One of my pet peeves is when hot food arrives tepid or even cold. The apple fritter I cut in to was so hot I had to wait to eat it! When I cut into the cheese, melted brie oozed out. Obviously just made, crisp crust.  Also got ""grilled"" duck. If it was grilled, I could not discern it; no grill marks, no smoky flavor. Just duck. I like duck but where was the grill? It came with chard, which I like a lot, but this chard was either old, undercooked, or both, it was tough. The potatoes (gratin I think?) were very good.  I notice their dessert menu put an apostrophe in ""sundae's"". There is no apostrophe in sundaes. Apostrophes denote possessive (Jane's) or contractions (isn't). Sorry, I'm an editor.  I did not get one of the ""sundae's"", instead I got coconut chiffon cake. The cake was rather dry and neither cake nor frosting really tasted like coconut, although there was an ample amount top and sides.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Altomonte's serves two purposes.. it is a fantastic source for pasta, cheese, and meats to take home, and it is also a place where you can order a sandwich or other prepared food and sit in the cafe out front, (including outdoor tables in warmer weather.)  I have had the pastas and cheese many times over the years, and have been very satisified. The sandwiches, including great roast pork with long hots, italian hoagies with sharp provolone, are as good as anything you will get in Center CIty. Their hot bar on the other hand leaves something to be desired. Under hot lamps, the food is barely warm, costs 7.99 a lb and is very ordinary. I got some spaghetti with tomato basil sauce, added two small chunks of italian sausage, and some peppers and onions all from the hot bar and it cost seven dollars. The food by the time I got to the cafe was tepid. I shouldn't have to reheat the food in the microwave before sitting down to eat. Very disappointing.

"Went back after more than a year...the restaurant is still in major need of a serious and deep clean. Better yet, this 1980's restaurant could use a complete remodel. Dirty floors, walls, miss-matched tiles, electrical wires from ceiling fans exposed, generally way outdated inside. However, the food was good. Tasty salsas and fresh crisp chips. The meal was very hot and fresh. On the other hand the beers I ordered were warm and flat. Service was good, however they kept insisting on sitting people next to each other in a middle of a pandemic. I would understand if it was super busy, but when I arrived there were only two tables occupied. They would sit new customers right next to the seated ones instead of skipping a table. Again, it was not busy what so ever. Poor thinking on their part. I do have to hand it to the customers that came in after me, each group were wearing their masks (even though AZ has made it illegal to require masks). Politics aside, it would have been nice if the staff (who were wearing masks) would have tired to keep space between tables until it got so busy that it was no longer feasible.

"This is the first time I had been to this suburban family-friendly staple. I can finally understand why everyone loves the breadsticks and endless salad. I also understand why people stop going after they grow up. One shouldn't venture into Olive Garden thinking they will be eating authentic Italian fare. However, it's quite yummy in its own right. I ordered the Pappardelle Pescatore, which is seafood on a bed of really fat noodles, tossed with a creamy tomato sauce. Shrimps were crisp and juicy, clams weren't fishy, and scallops were only so-so. The sauce was great though. The boyfriend ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo. Steak and pasta, not really a great combination. Even though he ordered medium, the steak that he received was definitely medium-well, borderline well-done. Quite unfortunate.  The ambience was nice, though a bit noisy. Servers were great.

"I'm pretty sure everyone has covered the fact that this place is a chain. awesome. ok.  well, let's be negative first since it's shorter... Bertucci's pizza makes my stomach want to cave in and devour me. Really, if I eat it, i will be doubled over in a matter of minutes begging for my companion to drive me home asap so i can lock myself in the bathroom.  My solution, i don't order the pizza (i'm really smart).  ok...the positives... I have NEVER received such great/friendly service at a *gasp* CHAIN restaurant before. zombies? Maybe you went there on an off night or something, but my experience has been the exact opposite every single time I've been in there. I've been in during the lunch rush (free salad p.s.) and only had an hour...and they did it with a smile! I've been there for dinner when they were slow and dinner when they were busy and every time I've been greeted and served by a super nice funny person.  There is a weird thing though... Every single time I go, they give me about 3 baskets of rolls (if you put food on the table, i will eat it, hence me eating the tummy busting pizza more than once) and then, they will bring me a bag packed FULL of rolls and a container of the oil and sometimes even free pasta. Do they do this for other people? I've asked others and they seem shocked. It's really not like I go there that often, maybe once ever 3 or 4 months? I've never had the same server, but they always send me home with a ton of extra food. Perhaps I look homeless or starving...  But I like this place. I like the people. I love the rolls.

The main drawback is the parking is out back, behind a mainly long commercial building which is practically vacant, except for Fronimo's.

We came to have dinner here one evening after reading the reviews on Yelp.  IN ALL HONESTY: The restaurant had a nice sign and the interior was very ethnic. It looked like a nice place to try so we decided to stay & order off the menu. We ordered two waters & two kebabs ($11 & $13). The food was VERY MEDIOCRE... Not to say that it tasted bad at all however the meat was really dry and the rice was bland. The meal only came with meat & rice .. There was no salad & there wasn't any sauce that came with the meals so we had to order some type of yogurt sauce for $3.99 - the sauce wasn't very tasty either. After we finished eating we got the bill and we got charged for the two waters we ordered however since we drank the water we just paid for it ($2). I would say that you are paying for the food you are getting ... It's reasonable. Our server was an older man and he seemed very genuine and nice ! He was definitely trying to give us good service. Wasn't very impressed with the food so I wouldn't say that I would recommend this place.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"220 East? More like, get me 220 miles east of this establishment. Tonight I dined here with my father who had been craving a cheeseburger (much to my chagrin, my famous home cooked duck à l'orange was not suitable for his palate).   My father's cheeseburger was overcooked, sprinkled with bagged shredded cheese, and bun- untoasted. Do not even get me started regarding the random lemon wedge on my plate. Was it garnish? And why had only one of us been selected as holder of the lemon wedge- it was biased and unbalanced. For the record... garnish should not contain seeds!  I can only describe this place to be a ""fictional depiction of a restaurant one would find in an Off-Broadway play, its food false and a mockery of dining.""  My father Martin however noted the restaurant was charming, with ""cozy"" lighting and kitchy Christmas lights around the perimeter of the ceiling.   All I wanted was for my detective father to have the pleasant cheeseburger that he had been craving. Maybe this time he'll think twice about passing up an offer of  my duck à l'orange. I should have just taken him to McDonalds- but with the looks of the fries we received, it seems like we might have done that already.  I'm listening, Tampa.

The food was fine, we tried the bacon cheeseburger which is massive and a chicken Caesar salad which came with extra dressing, always a nice touch for the restaurant to think ahead about different tastes.   The only issue we took was with the delivery service. I called at 2:45 to check on the order and the staff politely let me know it would be an hour to two hour wait because of new year's traffic. At  3:30 I called back with every intention of cancelling the order however the staff this time said the order was en route and should arrive in about twenty minutes. I did ask that the driver call or text when he arrived so as not to bother the other guests in the home and I am glad to say they honored my request. The only drawback is that I fell asleep and the food arrived at 4:30 am.   Tldr: decent food, responsive staff, slower than expected delivery on a busy night of the year.

On to the good things about Sidelines...lots of seating, drink specials, decent food for cheap prices. There is also a dance floor that I believe brings out a crowd on Saturday nights?

It appeared that the bartender was the only person serving in the whole restaurant but she did a really good job despite having a lot of tables/people at her bar. I would have expected service to be slower than it was but it was a fine pace for a lazy Sunday lunch. She earns 5 stars! We got lots of beer and some loaded fries to start and those were pretty good, good size to split 4 ways. I ordered the club sandwich and it was fine, I took out the third piece of middle bread because I don't think it adds anything to club sandwiches!

I really wouldn't mind coming here more regularly, they have 32 oz Summer Shandy on special right now!!

First time here and the first person you speak with should leave a lasting impression. This person is the cashier.

We handed the menus back to the woman without any acknowledgement. She acted as if we were a pain in her ass. This same waitress threw the fork at me. We were given clear soup and salad. I ordered some sushi. She plopped down two soy sauce bowls and two sets of chop sticks. With respect I may be ""white"" but, my whole family knows how to use chop sticks. There was zero reason for her to throw a fork at me. The Hibachi chef was lovely my family loved it. My children are young and find hibachi fascinating.  They cheered and made all kinds of positive compliments toward the chef. That part was great. As soon as he was finished we were expected to get out. I didn't have time to even eat my food. The other waitress was collecting the sauce bowls before my children or myself put a piece of food in our mouths. I brought it home with me to eat because we were all rushed out. So needless to say I ate my hibachi dinner at home. My children didn't even have time to finish eating as well. I can say they were prompt with the check though and collecting the tip. The only reason they received a 20% tip was because I assumed the hibachi chefs were apart of that. Would I go back? For hibachi  no because I do not enjoy being rushed. I understand that they have reservations however, my family should not have had to bring their food home to be eaten instead of at the restaurant. With respect I ordered the seafood combo.

The menu was simple, which makes decision making easy.  I was craving Asian and was curious what their Pad Thai would be like.  I know better than to expect anything authentic. But since I can happily eat crappy, Americanized Chinese food, Americanized Pad Thai wouldn't be an issue with me.  I liked it. When it came to me, I definitely smelled the fish sauce. But I didn't taste any tamarind at all. There were no scrambled eggs or green onions. There were red onions. And veggies. I don't remember if there were any tofu. I think there were peanuts. And there was a thin wedge of lime. I recognized it for what it was: Yummy noodles with flavor. And besides, I think I had read somewhere that pad thai is a recent development in Thai cuisine, created by some prime minister in the last century to help Thailand stop its dependence on rice imports and to use local flavors. So, authentic pad thai will probably continue to evolve.  Place was clean.

The lobster bisque was served in a small Le Creuset soup bowl and tasted good but not great. The pork oscar busco was delightful. The meat was tender and well marinated. The lamb was also impressive. The spinach salad was overpriced and left much to be desired.   Our waiter was neglectful towards us, he tried to rush us with his order and never checked back at us.

"I love that the minute you sit down at lunch the server immediately brings water, soup and an egg roll. So if you are short on time, you can immediately start eating while deciding what your main course is going to be. My favorite dish here is the Chicken Panang. It has a coconut curry base with large chunks of red and green bell peppers. It is so good that despite dining here several times, I can't bring myself to order anything different. The servers are prompt and friendly, even if their English is limited.   My only complaint is while every other part of the service is quick, the check out process tends to be a little slow. The credit card machine seems to take forever to go through and I never carry cash. When you have 5 coworkers with you, each paying with a card, it can be a little time consuming.   They do have a punch card and every tenth meal is free which is nice for the frequent diner.   I come back often because it tastes good and is convenient for lunch.

I love Surrey's and have been excited to go to the new location for a while because its so much closer to my house. Our group of 4 waited about an hour on a Sunday early afternoon, the location is nice because we went next door and got bloody mary's at Le Bon Temps.  The menu is the same but basic things about the food were not to the same quality I expect from Surrey's, my poached egg hadn't been cooked for more than a minute and the biscuits were way too salty. However, a friend got the corned beef and loved it so they're definitely getting some things right. The service was good, not great and we waited a while to put in our order and then ended up being the only party in the restaurant for a good portion of our meal. Overall, Surrey's Uptown has the potential to be just as good as the garden district original.

But to me, a 4 star review would be something that I would drive an hour to visit again.  I'm sorry to say it, but unless I learned of an advancement in their roasting, I would not drive that far.  Stop by if I'm in the neighborhood?? ABSOLUTELY!  Decor is great.  Lots of coffee shop personality.    My breakfast sandwich was ok.  I had the egg, roasted pepper and Kennet mushroom sandwich.  It was very sweet, and I don't care for sweet sandwiches - but that's probably my own fault for ordering the peppers.    My espresso was incredibly light.  That is not my expectation for espresso, and I don't think that's my fault at all.  Most folks expect a very dark, robust drink when ordering espresso.  To the credit of the counter staff, I asked to buy their two darkest roasts, one pound each.  One of them said ""everything we roast is very light.""  ...yup!!  I sure do wish them luck, and I'm sure that tons of folks will adore the super-light roasts.  But for this coffee but, I'm more than a little sad it wasn't on par with La Colombe or Ultimo.  Hopefully they grow into that!!!  Addition: I don't read other reviews before writing mine.  After posting, I read a few others.  Service issues were a common theme for a few.  There are three young workers here on a Saturday morning.  They are totally just 'hanging out.'  Not a bad vibe if you are looking to attract college kids who don't really expect much in terms of quality service.  For a more high end place, they need better training and supervision.  A great manager or an owner looking over their shoulders would probably mean fewer dirty tables, a cleaner back counter area, and more of a ""we want to WOW you"" approach.  Definitely another area for improvement.  I think the problem is a disconnection from the look of the place and the running of it.  So much potential, short on results.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"What happened? We love Church's Chicken but today was a disappointment. The chicken pieces were smaller, gren beans are no longer an option, and the macaroni and cheese was noticeably salty. Plus the $5 leg and thigh deal has gone up in price. The fried okra is still good, but we will think twice before we go back.

"After a long day of traveling and not eating all day (7 hours), we decided to go to Coterie which is attached to the hotel we were staying at.   The restaurant is your basic more upscale casual.    There was 5 of us for late lunch.   The waiter was friendly however he committed orders to memory and forgot our waters 4 times.   We ordered blackened alligator for appetizer.  It was okay.   A bit dry and not that flavorful.   For lunch I shared the crawfish etouffee which came in a big dish so plenty for my 11 year old and me.   We also ordered the bacon jam burger,  kid's cheese quesadilla, and jambalaya  wrap.   The etouffee had quite a bit of crawfish and the sauce was flavorful.   My husband liked the jambalaya wrap but I thought it was bland. The cheese quesadilla portion was large for a kid's meal and full of cheese.     The sazerac drink was good and strong.  Reminds me of a Manhattan.  My husband enjoyed his hurricane.     The bill came to about $83 without tip.   We learn throughout our trip to the French Quarter the range of $80-90 would be the norm for a meal for the five of us.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

They have beautiful underwater design pieces through the restaurant plus you can sit on the patio and enjoy the fountain show that goes off every hour at the Village.

The portions are very generous, and the prices are very reasonable. The host/hostess each time has been very friendly. The waitstaff always seems to be overwhelmed. Refills were practically nonexistent, after our food was brought we didn't see our waitress for a good 30 minutes or so. Getting our check was another 30 minute wait after finally getting a refill on our drinks.

"Logan's Roadhouse is not a restaurant that I would typically visit, but I was visiting with friends, so I didn't have much of a choice in where we ate.  We called ahead, and our group of twelve was seated right away.  There were five children in our party, and one of the servers noticed us as we were being seated and brought over a plate of loaded fries on the house.  They also have huge buckets of peanuts on the table to snack on while you wait for your food.  Their rolls with butter were also amazing.  They must put something in them because I could not stop eating them!  When it came time to ordering drinks, another gal at our table asked about dark beers.  The server recommended a Heineken.  I think he may have been under age, so I can't really hold that against him.  I ordered the grilled shrimp with a baked potato and grilled mushrooms.  The sides were great, and the shrimp was pretty decent.  Overall, I had a positive experience, but like I said this isn't the type of restaurant I'd choose to eat at on my own.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The food was five stars! Service left more to be desired. The table wasn't ready as they walked us over to it. They had us wait in the lobby for a few minutes, no worries there. The host was apologetic and sincere.  The table service was just awkward. My guest finished their water while we were enjoying our appetizer and her response was, ""Oh are you one of those people?"" Eeeeek. My silverware was very dirty and when the appetizer plates were removed she wanted me to keep them. Not sure where she expected me to lay them because they had beautiful placemats on the table and I didn't want to dirty it. When the entrees arrived my water needed refilling and the person refilling it asked if there was a hole in my glass. Really? Nope. Just a lot of ice.  We had the Brussel sprouts as an a appetizer and they were a bit more firm than I've had at other places, but tasty. I had the Frenchmen burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was seasoned perfectly. I enjoyed a glass of Meomi Pinot noir with it. The wine pour was small, but I appreciated that it was served the right temperature and in a proper glass.  This place was beautiful, the food was great, and the wine list was excellent. I'd love to try this place again!

"I had the pork rib platter that included Mac and cheese, collard greens, and corn bread. Personally I think the collars greens we're the worst thing about my meal. The cornbread was OK but it reminded me of the store bought kind. The Mac and cheese was my fav, only because the ribs had a lot of fat on them to fully enjoy. On the upside of my experience the wait staff are friendly, the place is cozy and the Chilli is AMAZING!

"3.5 stars.  I really enjoyed my meal here!  Since the last time I had ever been to Reno I was under the age of 2, I really wanted to go to a Reno buffet, even though I absolutely cannot STAND the environment of casinos.  But I do love a good buffet although I have yet to have gone to a good buffet.  Plus, I was already staying in Lake Tahoe.  When choosing a buffet, I had mistaken the El Dorado buffet's (better) reviews for this one,and was disappointed when I found out because I had already been in line for 10 minutes.  The bf and I went around 6pm and the line wasn't that long, but it significantly grew after we got in line.  Total waiting time was only about 20 minutes and it was $20 a person.  The food was actually pretty good.  The breaded fish was delicious, and although the crab legs were cold, I had a whole bunch of those.  The clams were okay -- a lot of them had fallen out of the shell and they had not been washed thoroughly; some were definitely pretty sandy.  Shrimp scampi was also very good - the shrimp were very fresh.  I did not visit the meat station as I am not too much of a fan of meat and was only interested in the sea food.  The desserts looked so overwhelmingly sweet and loaded with fat and sugar.. I passed.  The strawberries were perfectly ripe and the watermelon was not ripe at all.  Service was great - they always pick up your plate before you return to the table.  This buffet was definitely better than the ones in the bay area .. and next time i would really like to visit El Dorado's buffet.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
I can't say i am a fan although I came here for the 1st time based on yelp reviews. Maybe I shouldn't base a first time experience and trust others' opinions anymore. We came on a Saturday at lunchtime just as the crowd was disappearing. Our service was particularly slow b/c it looked like there were only 1 person waiting on customers. THis place would be better if they can be more prompt with the customers. The food wasn't that much better. We got the kalbi which had a few choice parts in there but the rest was fat. How can you sell that to customers?   Also how can you give complimentary desserts to some customers and not to others? Honestly it doesnt matter to me but show the same courtesy. Would i come back? maybe. I'd have to try other places to see but i can not gauge on saying this is an excellent place to come for korean foood.  Maybe I came on a day where the quality of the food dropped. Lucky me.   I will say the waitress who seemed to be the owner was kind to our table but was very preoccupied with talking on the phone.

"How many yelp stars should be given to an establishment for being cool (but mostly just that and nothing more)?   Annnnd I've decided that three seems like a good answer to my own question. I've been at Penn for four years now, which means that I've probably walked by the Pod probably like 2360 times, even though I hadn't ever been inside. I wasn't particularly drawn to it from what I could see on the outside, but when I found out that our RA/GA staff end-of-year celebration this year was at the Pod, I became pretty eager... I guess my curiosity over this place had grown over time.    So, when we came in May for our staff celebration, they had set up two long tables to accommodate our large staff group. It's surprisingly spacious and I thought the type of futuristic look that they were going for was okay (even though I wasn't a fan of their bathroom design; the tiny metallic pods were kinda eerie to me).   My main impression of their food was that it was trendy, not being particularly good or bad. I might have had stronger opinions if this was coming out of my own wallet, but tbh I didn't even know the cost of what I was eating (thank you Ware!). I did really enjoy the mocktails that they offered, including their ""vanilla ginger cream soda"" and sparkling ""white bubble teas"". Oh, and they had some taro cake/ice-cream dessert topped with colorful crunchy treats that was pretty unique and tasty as well.   All in all, I'm thankful that my job allowed me to experience this place and it is one of the few fancier places in UC, but if I wanted to spend a whole lot of money on food, there's a lot of other establishments that would probably win out.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Everything was well prepared - Pate was very good, as were meatballs. While the octopus was also good, I expect more than a single tentacle for $12. Really liked the bone marrow pizza, if a bit on the ""personal"" size.  Salad was good, but again a bit pricey. Trend held on the entrees- both salmon and veal chop were good, but at that price I expect meals, not ala cart presentation.

"Went yesterday for the first time and want to like this place but will need to go back before I am sold ( they have just been open a month).   First let me say the chicken parmigiana was very good.  Yes I  know this is a deli but after spending 20minutes trying to digest the ridiculous menu(I'll get to that later) we decided on the parm and were not disappointed. Large portion and served with a bolognese type sauce.   The dessert counter was a must on the way out. Cannolis and eclairs were great (we don't do cheesecake) but expensive. Desert to go cost as much as dinner.   As for the actual dining experience 1) tables and chairs uncomfortable and wobbly (had to be moved just so we could eat at a table that was not in constant motion). 2) menu is LARGE in size and difficult to handle and even more difficult to read. Even asked waiter for advice how to approach it and he just walked off. This is NOT just a deli. They have food all over the map and the menu is hard to digest (no pun intended). Not to mention quite a few menu options were marked 'coming soon'.  Just dealing w the menu itself I wanted to leave. Our server came by 3 times to take our order but never once made suggestions other than 'yea its big and overwhelming I know'. 3) while pleasant you could tell our server was really green in the business. (solidified when asked why type of dressing I wanted on my Cesar salad ) Took several times back to the table to get additional details about or order that had already been answered (remember we only ordered one meal). Was clear the struggle with the ridiculous menu is real for servers too. Cesar Salad served does not come tossed. Cesar dressing was on the side and had to ask for another plate to toss myself. Once dinner was served took two people to find a sharp knife (aka steak knife). The thought of serving Parmesan cheese on the side w Italian food required 2 requests and another long wait trip to the kitchen that returned w a bowl of cheese I am sure came off the prep line (at lest it was fresh and yummy).   I have yet to decide what their vibe is supposed to be (subway deli, sports bar, family dining...???...) I am sure a lot of tonight's experience has to do with they are just too new.

We both got a variety of balls and sauces over linguini (maybe the linguini is where we went wrong?). I'm not sure if the problem was not enough sauce or possibly that the meatballs were a bit bland?

"I came just after the lunch rush, assuming I might get their best efforts. I was served in mere minutes. The atmosphere, as noted, is pleasant and clean, and the staff sociable. In addition, their ingredients were clearly fresh.  The dish on the other hand  - I had the Cashew Chicken Curry - seemed only a few steps above mall food. Half of the chicken was tender, the other other half rubbery. The vegetables were haphazardly cut in various sizes which meant some were crisp, others mushy. The sauces for both the coconut rice and curry seemed to rely too heavily on sugar and/or salt for flavour.  With so many other glowing reviews, I'll assume this was an off day for them.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Mediocre food. I have visited this restaurant twice. The first time was during the first month it opened as a business. During this visit, I thought the food was mediocre. Unfortunately, giving it the benefit of the doubt, I decided to return more recently and not much to my surprise... food was mediocre.  Before I continue to use the word mediocre, let me point out that it is only the food that is mediocre. But then again, what is a restaurant without its food? The restaurant is a cute little BYOB with a homey atmosphere located in Fishtown. The decor is warm and welcoming, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, but the food lacks depth and innovation. It's such a disappointment.   Have you ever eaten something and thought, ""its good, but its missing something""... that's this restaurant. The items on the menu sound innovative and intriguing but don't taste as good as they sound. In other words, the ideas are there but in terms of execution, it misses the mark.   Bottom line, it isn't a bad restaurant, it's just not a great restaurant. If you aren't someone who loves restaurants and food culture, chances are you will eat here and think its great but if you are, then you will most likely think the food lacks flavor and therefore, is just mediocre.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I prefer Publix over Winn Dixie or Fresh Market. The stores are were well laid out, easy to navigate and find almost anything you need.  The stores are always busy and the shelves are better stocked around the late evening from 8pm to close. Particularly the produce section. It is a headache to go through that picked over section at any other time of day.   The bakery offers a wonderful selection of baked goodies. I recently had one of the best cherry danishes. It was unbelievably good.  I like how friendly the cashiers and other employees are every time I shop here.   The only con about Publix is it's parking lot.

"This is perfectly passable fried chicken. OK - The boneless chicken in my 5-piece order was actually very good. The breading was light and crunchy, and the meat was succulent. The wing was also quite tasty with great texture. Things got a little weird with the drumstick and the breast. Neither of these had rendered skin, which resulted in breading/batter that separated from the skin. The semi-rendered skin beneath was a little nauseating, and I was glad I had the boneless pieces and the wing first, otherwise I don't think I would have gotten too far in this meal.   Honestly, the house-made pickles were my favorite part of the order. As for sauces, skip the buffalo. It offers very little heat and is oddly a little sweet. I think if there was an option to order a boneless-only meal (like the chicken sandwich), but the weird unrendered skin issue is still giving me the creeps.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Overall, the restaurant was ok. Nothing great or inspired but nothing bad either.  Started with an interesting cocktail I hadn't seen before - the Godfather (amaretto di sarono and scotch) - but It was a strange combination and the two flavors mixed well but formed a rather strange tasting drink. I would not recommend this and would not get it again but I admit it was interesting to try the first time around.  We started with the octopus salad. I've had octopus a number of times but this octopus just seemed rather soggy. I think it was a result of adding faaaaar to much lemon juice and slices of lemon. It had an strong lemon flavor while the octopus itself lacked the flavor it normally retains.  For my entree I had the pappardelle. I would say the experience was somewhat similar to the octopus, it was ok, but not great. The lamb was the best part of dish. The pasta was pretty good, but the bolognese was pretty poor. It was salty and rather runny; it was especially poor sauce in comparison to the bolognese I had at Meridian Restaurant & Bar the other week which was superb.  A friend got the ossubuco which came over risotto. He said the meat was great and I tried the risotto which was full of flavor so there are some good dishes on offer by the sounds of it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
This Tijuana is so-so. It was clean and the folks were friendly during my last visit but the food itself wasn't as good as I've had at other Tijuana's.  I usually get the same thing at every Tijuana Flat's-Chicken flautas with a side of black beans and rice. The flautas are usually a little crunchy and flaky and so very good. And rice-which is so hard to get right is almost always perfect at the many Tijuana Flats I've gone to in Orlando and Tampa. However...maybe it was an off night so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt...since they were super nice.  The chicken flautas were disappointing sad little tubes of soggy tortilla-no crunchy or flake whatsoever. The consistency of a flauta the day after you stick it in a microwave. They must have given all the crunch to the rice because that tasted like they boiled a few pebbles in a pot. I'm thinking since we were there a little later at night we maybe just missed the last batch of fresh rice and maybe the flautas were not as fresh either and reheated in an oven...not sure. They're food was just pretty off. Again...the people were nice...the food was meh. We'll definitely try one more time since this is such a convenient location to basically everything.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Chinese food is one of my guilty pleasures.  I've always loved the Sang Kee in Chinatown so when I heard that they were opening up a branch in the Sheraton right near Penn, I was very excited.  It's definitely a completely different feel from either the Reading Terminal outpost or the original.  The place is much cleaner, neater, quieter but just as crazy busy and hectic.  I was worried that the strong smell of Chinese food would permeate throughout the hotel lobby (which is the only way you can get to the restaurant) but they do an amazing job of controlling the food smells.    That said, I think people's most popular thing here are the weekday lunch specials.  You get a choice of an appetizer (dumplings, soup or spring roll), entree (general tao's chicken and the beef & eggplant in garlic sauce are my favorite) and fried rice/brown rice/white rice.  It is surprisingly very filling and only $8 ($9 if you get a drink like tea or soda).  Being a fan of Ten Ren in Manhattan, I think the bubble tea (and the smoothies, at that) here is disgusting.  Absolutely terrible so don't fall for the coupons the restaurant sends out every month that get you to order one (just sign up for emails on their website).    The Chicken In Crunchy Lettuce Wraps seems like an excellent idea in theory but it's very flavorless.  Even with a ton of sriracha, it was tasteless.  I don't like the peking duck here but my boyfriend loves it.  I am a huge fan of Peking Duck House in Manhattan midtown and Chinatown so this place just doesn't cut it.  The pancakes are store-bought, they're dry, too thin and crumble after you make the ""burrito"".  The duck comes out in a pretty plate but I'm used to the whole duck coming out whole with a chef in his white uniform and slices away at it right in front of you.  You usually have to ask for more cucumber and scallion slices which is annoying because they are very conservative with their servings.  Also, $18 for half a duck can fill 2 people but the duck is not juicy on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside.  I love the eggplant in garlic sauce here.  The hot and sour soup is just ok.  The House Special Pan Fried Noodle is decent.  Their jia jia mien is pretty good (on the menu, it's called something else).  Their fried shrimp with walnuts was too greasy and the sweet white sauce they pour on top of it is like gloppy blobs of pure sugar.  I love their no-wire takeout containers but as for the food, it's just ok.  Service is either super slow and you have to yell to get someone's attention or you are served promptly and efficiently.  It just depends on what day the servers are having it seems.  (I've also done catering for my law school through them and they did a great job so if you want to order Chinese food for 20 people or more, they're definitely reliable and the food was good.)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Decided to try Jockamo's pizza because there were no other viable new options in the area.  The reviews are good, so I had a nice little half mile walk here to try out their pizza.  They have lunch specials that amount to ""pizza by the slice"" and each day there is a different pizza of the day.  Today being Wednesday was Tomato and Gouda.  I decided to try 2 slices, one pepperoni and one Tomato and Gouda. The wait, was beyond ridiculous to be served 2 slices.  It took 30 minutes to get 2 slices out to me when the place was around 30ish percent capacity.  Even a pizza thrown into the oven from scratch takes around 14 minutes, so how can a place that is prepared for a lunch crowd ordering pizza by the slice type of arrangement not have pizzas coming out almost immediately?  This was very disappointing.    The pizzas came out, and they were a decent size for slices (see pic below), probably 50% larger than a normal slice elsewhere would be, so that was nice!  The issue was...they were DRIPPING in grease.  It was gross.  The pepperoni obviously had grease from the pepperonis but the cheese they use let out a ton of grease as well.  I had to use a napkin to dry it up a bit...was not appetizing.  As far as flavor goes...the pizza was perfectly fine.  It was almost cracker thin crust that I do enjoy, and everything tasted fresh.  Cannot fault anything with the flavor.  It was just good pizza....but not amazing pizza.  Lets be honest, it is hard to mess up pizza...even bad pizza is decent...but the difference is great pizza really stands out..and this just didn't do that.  The Tomato and Gouda pizza was very forgettable.  The tomatoes were cut so thick, that the juices spilled as they cooked...so the pizza was soggy and made the grease even more wet.  Not appetizing at all.  All in all, there was nothing wrong with this place and the ambiance was cool...I just don't know that I would come back.  Nothing here was memorable enough to make me be excited about returning.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Had Deanies Seafood for lunch yesterday. I ordered the stuffed shrimp. Its stuffed with crabmeat and then it's fried. My co-worker said you can ask for it grilled instead of fried. (Not sure if that's true) The flavor was great. It has a little spicy kick to it but not an overwhelming spicy.. it was fried perfectly. It came with a side of mashed potatoes which tasted like a stick of butter. It had no flavor. It also came with a small side of coleslaw which surprisingly was good.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I was really looking forward to trying this upscale-ish Filipino restaurant in fishtown. We ended up going for brunch on a Sunday (which is all they serve). We opted for the ube french toast and a longanisa and garlic rice platter. The French toast was good, creamy with a nice mix of flavors with the ube and the walnuts. The rice dish was a bit off, the longanisa is a traditional pork dish which we thought would be more a savory dish (our waitress even said it would be) but it was quite sweet. Almost dessert like in its sweetness. The rice was a bit cold and hard and lacked any flavor besides garlic. We wished we could have the rice heated up a little and I had to go to the counter myself to ask for a little soy said since service was almost non existent. There were only 2 tables (including ours) and our waitress barely checked on us. Maybe it was an off day but my friends rave about their dinner.

"A good but mixed review.   This is the first time we ate dinner there. I was not sure what to have or expect. The people were great and the atmosphere was that of a typical diner. I had to ask for recommendations and I was guided to anything sauté, crab cakes, scallops and most of their seafood. It was suggested that the fried food was ok. I had 2 kids and my parents with me so we ordered a variety.   The chicken fingers and fried oysters were terrible to us. There was no seasoning and what flavored came through tasted funny. My 1 year old rejected the chicken fingers so I tasted them and it was really not good. We changed it for a grilled cheese and it was great.   I had the fried oysters and they were equally as bad so I switched it out with the scallops which were spectacular.   The staff said that the fried food is not made fresh but all of their fish and sauté dishes are handmade and fresh. You can taste and see the difference.  For the life of me I can't think of why they would serve their fried food like that in a family diner where I'm sure a fair amount of fried food will be requested.   If you order right the place is great and a good value. I will go back with my family but will keep the ordering in mind.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"After having a delicious meal here with my boyfriend and his family, my review deserves and update.  I wish I could update it up to 4 or 5, but some clear misses prevent that.  Thankfully, the misses were not the food.  It was excellent!  Starters included a delicious flat bread as well as a duck Spätzle appetizer.  I tried the Artisan green salad with a homemade buttermilk dressing that was so good, I wanted to lick the plate!  I went with the Short Rib again, honestly it was the tastiest looking item on the menu.  This time it was accompanied with a horseradish popover which was pretty much a popover oozing with horseradish creme.  Delicious!  Also great were the farm-to-table sides that accompanied our meals, family style.  We enjoyed sweet potatoes with edamame, broccolini and sauteed mushrooms.  After the wonderful first three courses, we had the star of our evening, the lavender Panna Cotta.  Incredible.  So all that amazing food...in over three hours.  There were at least 30 minutes from the end of each course to the beginning of the next.  Thankfully, we didn't have anywhere else to be, but it was a bit disconcerting; especially since the restaurant was mostly empty.  Our server was also very awkward and seemed very lost.  A neighboring table appeared to have the same problem.  I feel bad complaining about that, and I totally understand how rough it can be the first week or so, but it was just really uncomfortable.

"This is a quiet spot in Green Hills with a nice patio. When we walked in, there was no host & we waited for awhile at the host stand for someone to acknowledge us. The host was kind of rude considering that we had a reservation & everything.   I was a bit surprised at how brief the drink list was. Given that there were only two cocktails listed, I was hesitant to try one, but the wine & beer list was quite short for a nice place like this. There was only one of each wine varietal, so not much of a selection, and just a handful of beers. Moreover, my boyfriend tried to order one of the few beers & they were out of it.   For dinner, we shared the 10oz filet mignon & white cheddar truffle Mac. Although we ordered the filet medium, it came out medium well/well done. The mashed potatoes  that it came with had very little flavor, but the green beans were good. The mac, however, was absolutely out of this world! The rich umami of the truffle was perfectly balanced with the sharp cheddar, and the top was nice & crisp.

"I appreciate Lucky Bamboo for trying to fill the void of dim sum and authentic Chinese food in Nashville. Really, this is the only place you can get dim sum at normal prices. I believe dim sum carts are only rolled out on the weekends. They have all the dishes you'd expect: shrimp dumplings, siumai, rice rolls, and even xiao long bao (soup dumplings). Food is decent, good taste overall but not everything is perfect. Soup dumplings for example can be a little dry. I wished the carts came around more frequently and with a little more variety.   The main woman who serves tables is the absolute sweetest lady, but she is often busy so service can be a bit slow. If you're coming for table service, not dim sum, my recommendation is to just order all the food at once and don't order entrees after putting in your appetizer order. You'll be left waiting a while before you can put your next order in. I do keep coming back because like I said, the food isn't bad by any means. Some of my favorites include stir fried string beans, shredded tofu and pork, and eggplant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"We popped into this joint on New Year's Eve to grab a quick bite before heading over to check out the NYE festivities in the area.   Our waitress was great and we thought the servers were attentive to all the customers, not just the ones in their section. The manager was quick to tell a patron to go outside when he lit a cigarette at the bar. This is a non-smoking establishment, but they do have an outside area. I'm not sure if there's food service out there though.  I'm giving 3 stars because the food prices are just super high for what you get. We ordered the blackened catfish poboy with fries and an order of fried eggplant sticks to share. $16 is outrageous for a poboy with 1 piece of catfish in it. The eggplant sticks were good, but $9 is high and it isn't that many sticks - maybe 18 and they're the size of french fries. They had a little kick, but they didn't seem fried to order - I thought they should have been crispier. The remoulade that came with everything was good.   If we're ever back in NOLA, we won't be back here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"It's your basic Americanized Chinese food...but sometimes that is what you crave. Nothing fancy but take out is always quick and tastes the same each time.   Lunchtime combos are a good deal. Most are under $7 and it comes with a choice of soups and either egg roll or a can of soda. I like the chicken and broccoli or the shrimp, pork and chicken with broccoli.

When I finally made it in for breakfast it wasn't at all what I expected. To me the inside is like eating in a service kitchen. There's a counter, beverage & cutlery station, and a few toasters. This makes no difference to me but it wouldn't be the ambience you would want for your cousins baby shower.  I have called ahead a few times to place an order for pick up.

"I found the food here to be pretty decent. I had pretty low expectations based on the other reviews I found on here. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and was pleased with the taste. The beer selection on draft was pretty great too. The negative side of this, however, was the service. We weren't promptly attended to upon sitting down. Once we ordered, our food was brought out, but the waitress never checked in on us to see how our food was, nor did she ask if we wanted another round of drinks (though the beers were empty). Nearing the end of our meal, another waiter came over and cleared the table, despite the fact that I was still eating off my plate. I actually looked around to see if there were hidden cameras somewhere with someone about to jump out and tell me I'd been pranked. I would consider eating here again, but would do takeout and never actually go back for a sit-down meal.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I was really looking forward to trying out this place after all of the glowing Yelp reviews.  I have to admit, I was somewhat underwhelmed.  If this review were just based on atmosphere, I would give it 5 stars all day.  This place is BEAUTIFUL and huge.  We sat in an area that had a glass ceiling, so it was like dining outside without the temperature concerns.  We were told we'd have a 30 minute wait and were pleasantly surprised when we were called after 15 minutes.  When we walked up to the hostess stand, we were told they were clearing off our table and that it would be just a minute.  Another woman then walked up and asked if her table was ready and she was seated right away.  We were then told that our table wasn't ready and had to wait about 10 more minutes.  I'm pretty sure that our table was given away to this other person, and I'm not really sure why.  When we were seated, the service was quick and the food was good.  I ordered the shitake mushroom and roasted red pepper flatbread.  It was tasty.  My fiance' ordered the club sandwich.  The sandwich was supposed to come with avocado, but it was left off.  The waiter took it back and corrected the issue, however, the sandwich was somewhat falling apart once the avocado was added.  I was very surprised to hear that this place is not open for dinner or on Sundays.  I really think that Oxford Exchange would be a nice dinner spot and that they would be successful.  Overall, I had an okay experience at Oxford Exchange, but I'm not sure if it was a good enough experience for me to go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

When I got there I let my waiter know that I was on an hour lunch. There was no sense of urgency on our visit and I was almost late back to work. Normally I would not comment to this but it was not very busy on the day we visited and so I found it strange they could not accommodate our 1 hour lunch.   Overall 3/5 stars.

"Quick Summary: I've always liked the idea of dim sum in the evening, kind of like Chinese Tapas. The flavors were good but didn't really seal the deal for a return visit.  I was very excited to find a place that offered xiaolongbao, a shanghai speciality soup dumpling. In retrospect though I wish I hadn't... they weren't soupy enough and weren't served with the proper sauce. The skin of the dumpling should be delicate and if you accidentally tear the skin (noob!) soup should come flowing out of them. These dumpling had no soup and the skin was very thick. And there was no special sauce that came with them, they should be served with a vinegary soy sauce with slivers of ginger... if you ever find them proper... they are delicious!  The rest of the meal was decent, I ordered pretty much the traditional dim sum items and was content with them. The service was a bit slow, but I assumed that was because dim sum had to be prepared, since its not normally served during the dinner hours.  Overal a satisfactory meal. I would consider trying some of their regular entrees next time. There was a family sitting next to me that seemed to be really enjoying their dinner (looked like shrimp and a few other dishes). But for dim sum I'd probably take a tour of the other locals before trying my hand at dim sum at night here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I'm thinking this place must be under new ownership or a BIG change in the kitchen. This was once my very favorite place to eat or grab take-out. The dishes were consistent and delicious every single time.  Unfortunately in the last several months I have been disappointed in each experience. Not at all with the staff or the restaurant itself, just w/ the food. The dishes are seriously lacking in flavor and sometimes in portion size. My recent take-out order had half as much food in the container compared to previous visits. And the vegetarian noodle dishes I ordered had only 2-3 small pieces of tofu in one and NONE in the other.   It's not cheap, at roughly $15 a person and quality/quantity just doesn't seem to match the price lately.

We arrived at 7:30 and there was only one other table taken out of about 12.  It was very quiet and I cannot see any families with little kids eating here.  The decor was very plain and the place seemed clean.  We were greeted by a woman and the guy who makes the sushi.  Menus were given to us which had the usual options like sushi, shashimi, rice bowls, fried udon and bento boxes.  There was also a lunch section which had lower prices.  The food quality was good, prices were excellent, the quantity was nice and it tasted fresh, especially the tuna and salmon.  The only bad thing was my teriyaki chicken had a light batter but it was not hot and crunchy as I expected since it came on a hot plate with bean sprouts.  The bowl of rice was a bit bigger than other Japanese restaurants.  The miso soup was a bit salty and not hot enough and the salad was okay.  I would not order this again.  My husband had the al a carte grilled pork with ginger sauce, the thin slice of pork was not browned as expected but he said it tasted okay.  My daughter ordered the al a carte BBQ beef and her beef looked really tasty.  The  Sahara and Caterpillar rolls both were very good, 8 pieces for each order and these are definitely something to try.

I am glad i took the leap of faith, they were delicious. Not to oily,the cheese was white cheddar,with the consistency of warm mozzarella. The burger was good, better than most fast food joints. I love the fact that they serve the root beer in chilled mugs , with free refills. The really only negative i have is the people that work there.

"This beautiful restaurant in the heart of the French Quarter grabs you with its bright colors and whimsical reference to the Ruby Slipper that Dorothy wore...click your ruby slippers and find yourself in this restaurant (or anyone of its three locations).  While the decor is whimsical and unique, the food is just average. I had the biscuit, cinnamon swirl pancakes, and the french toast batons - a balanced meal! :) What I expected was tons of butter and sugar, and while each dish seemed to have loads of both of these ingredients that can help elevate even the mundane dishes into guilty pleasures, the food missed that mark - leaving you feeling more guilty than happy. The portions were large. The biscuits fell a little of shy of being flaky goodness, the cinnamon pancakes were average and nothing unique that you would remember after you left the establishment, and the baton sticks were on the greasier side.  Given the popularity of the restaurant, as seen by the number of customers patronizing the establishment, and the fact that there are three locations within a short area, my opinion definitely seems to be of the minority of customers rather than a majority of customers...so proceed forth with caution and decide for yourself if you are in the majority or in the minority.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"We were very disappointed with our experience at Liuzza's today. I had not been in a few years. I think I was expecting something more.  The inside was a little less nice than I remember. Lots of deferred maintenance. It was raining most of the day. Water was trickling down the wall we were next to. It was forming puddles under the tables all around us. A dead cockroach was laying in the middle of the walkway to the bathrooms. The men's bathroom looked like it had not been updated or given much attention in a long time. The sink faucets were corroded and the water did not flow smoothly. The toilet flushed very slowly, yet there was no clog. The space was clean though. Wife said that the ladies room was clean as well. I don't know if maintenance and such was put off because of COVID, or lack of money, but it showed.   The staff were very nice. They were down one cook, so the food took a very long time to come out. The servers were apologetic and let everyone know there would be delays in the food being prepared. To their credit, they were doing their best despite the physical conditions.  While we waited, we ordered drinks. The bartender either didn't know what they were doing or just didn't want to do it. We ordered Pimm's Cups, a pretty common New Orleans cocktail. They were probably the least good ones we've ever had. 7-Up with a splash of Pimms. No gin, no garnish, and very watery.

"I think it's impressive what Vedge is trying to accomplish. It's hard to compete with other restaurants of a similar caliber in the area, especially without meat.  Dishes are creative and flavorful, but it seems like they use certain ingredients in excess to compensate. For example- avocado. Of course avocado is delicious! It would be interesting to see some other ingredients not normally associated with being tasty, turned into something delicious.  The desserts were very unique and delightful! Just the right amount, and not too heavy. They have very creative ice cream flavors.  5 dishes total for two people was a perfect amount of food. Not too full, not hungry afterwards.   Apart from the food, the service felt like we were in an assembly line. The food came out very quickly. We ate all our food, drinks, desserts in less than an hour. It wasn't so much of a dining ""experience"" as it was an attempt to turn over tables quickly.   All in all, it is over priced for vegetarian dishes, but they get some points for creativity.

"The three star rating is mainly a reflection of some very strong points and very weak points. I ordered General Tso's Tofu and Dan Dan Noodles. The website offered a promotion of a free order of fried wontons with this, which I took advantage of. The order was for takeout.  Dan Dan Noodles: These were very good and very flavorful. Competitive with Han Dynasty, which is saying a lot. I'd give a slight edge to Han Dynasty but Chili Szechuan's offering is significantly cheaper which makes it a great value. The one problem is that they do not mix the sauce in with the noodles for takeout -- the sauce is all on the bottom, so you have to toss the noodles yourself to mix it up. This isn't a problem if you are eating at home, but if you don't have a bowl to toss it in at work you might be in trouble. The container that they come in is not large enough to toss the noodles in.  General Tso's Tofu: The tofu was not crispy, but the flavor was among the best I've had. On the whole I'd say it's a plus, but you might want to be careful if you really need that crispy finish.   Fried Wontons: These were not included in my order. Instead, they gave me a small wonton soup. I am not sure if this was a mistake on their end or if the promotion on the website is inaccurate. Either way I did not notice until I got home (should have checked!), so it didn't seem worth going back to the restaurant to deal with it. The soup was among the worst that I've had. The wonton skins were reasonable (a bit of a middle ground between the thick skins you see in most takeout Chinese restaurants and the thin cantonese-style wontons that you get in most Chinatown restaurants) but there was almost no filling. There were only two wontons in the soup and the broth had little to no flavor. I should make a disclaimer though: I tried the soup after the Dan Dan Noodles, so it may be that the noodles were so flavorful that my palate was wrecked for the soup.   Other: It's worth noting that no rice was included. I'm not sure if this was intentional or a mistake.   Chili Szechuan has a real shot to stand out among West Philly Chinese spots -- hopefully the problems listed above are due to the restaurant's newness and will be corrected over time!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

We had: - BBQ Shrimp PoBoy - Fried Shrimp PoBoy - Gumbo - Draft Beer  The beer was cold and refreshing.   The gumbo was really tasty bit wasn't served very hot.   The PoBoys had a lot of shrimp on them. We felt the buns they were served  on were a bit too large and not very soft. Too hard  to hold and eat the  PoBoy without the shriimp constantly falling off.  But the shrimp was tasty.   The fries served with the shrimp were not hot and crispy. Rather, they were barely warm, soft and limp.

"Looking at the other reviews for this, I have to disagree with the extremely low ratings.   This place is definitely not where one would venture off to expecting the best tasting food around, but they offer a very large selection on their seven or eight buffet tables. There's the Mongolian grill area, the sushi area, and six other areas offering your usual Chinese buffet options. They also have quite a few dishes that I have yet to work up enough nerve to try. I did try the chicken feet on a dare awhile back. They were definitely not ""my thing"", but they were by no means awful.  On Sundays, they offer a nice selection of seafood including king crab claws, crawfish, huge boiled shrimp, crabs, clams, oysters, and more. Usually, that's the day that I end up eating there. Their crawfish, although not that spicy, are actually seasoned with something other than plain old salt, which seems to be how most Chinese buffets that offer crawfish seem to be satisfied with.  This place, although not the finest Chinese food in the area by far, offers a nice selection of above average tasting food with a wide variety of choices for a reasonably low price.  My daughter and I ventured there today once again and both enjoyed ourselves and had an overall pleasurable experience. The total for lunch on a Sunday (which I think is a bit more expensive then their weekly buffet prices because of all the seafood) enjoyed ourselves for a total of $27.71 plus the tip. That included two adult buffets and two drinks. All of the food was piping hot and tasted above average.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I went up to Cassava's on a adventure to the Greater Northeast of Phila. To see One of Philly's Best Bartender's  for the past 10 or so years,Jonathan. I Drove up with a Cute Cheerleader & my Brother Rick  the dancing Machine. We got there pretty late and I think the place had only been open for a week or so. It has tons of space which makes me think, I gotta have a party here. We had some Sangria's ,Kamikaze's and some other mixed drinks to get us started. Everyone was friendly . We also had some BBQ Chicken which I only had a little taste of ,as My Brother ate most of them and left me just enough to make me madd. Anyway I had  my small pIece, it was very tasty,not to spicy just enough to make me think my brother is a @!*S. I really wanted to kick his Butt,For eating up most of the food and leaving a teaser piece, so that you know it was really good, but there's no more( I didnt think you wanted any). it was already late. We danced around for a while Great music playing. I had fun Chatting with Jon about the Grand Opening Coming the 11th-13th of Febuary.  I will get a chance to try more of the food and get there earlier minus my brother . I have a feeling with the expertise and experience that Jon will bring to Cassava's, I will be out there more often. They also have an outdoor area they are  planning to do Special Cigar Events, so that means me and my crew will be there this Spring  and Summer over other places  in town . I am looking forward to trying every Dish on the menu. I love my brother ,so he probally will be with me Grand Opening weekend. You gotta love him he's a Dancing Machine. See you there, I will post an update afterward.  On  An extra Note Jonathan Was one of the Winners of the 4 Orange Vodka contest Held at Union Trust Jan 16th. He's got mad skills with the liquor and also a cutie.  UPDATE: I went to the Party on Saturday and had a blast, the music was great, the dj was Joe Broscoe .Rick didnt make it as he was too tired from God knows what. The energy was great that night everyone was so friendly. I sat at the bar which has a lot of room to eat comfortably at . For starters I had a very large Caesars Salad  which had fresh green pepers and black olives, it makes a big difference . Then Calamari  with a  mango chutney, it was delicious just the circles,Then Finally , I had the  Crab Cakes . I have to say, that alot of places due to whatever reasons have stoped doing Crab Cakes,  which sometimes lets you know how serious  the chef in the kitchen is . Well they have somone who cares back there, as they were really good made with real lump crabmeat ,They  taste homade and the size was just enough. I asked the dj and 3 other people  what they liked the most and they said the Quesadilla's . I couldn't eat anymore, so i will have to save the rest of the menu for next time .Johnathan does a great job of entertaining and checking up on the patrons, so its worth the trip.  I am looking forward to the Cigar Saturdays, They are planning for the Spring.  I will update you soon as Rick will have to test out the dance floor with me on the next visit.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"After reading the reviews I thought this place was worth a try. I ordered the skirt steak with black beans and rice, the wife ordered the baked chicken with black beans and rice. The portions were definitely plentiful! The food had a good taste, the baked chicken fell right of the bone. The skirt steak was a little tough but had flavor to it. The prices were very reasonable.  The only complaint I had was we both had stomach problems afterwords. Decor of the place looked a little outdated, I also just picked the order up so not sure of how the staff is.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I wanted to love it because it has such a cool atmosphere and I thought I would because it's always busy, but I honestly wasn't a huge fan. The food was ok, but the menu selection was pretty small and not that impressive, same for the cocktails. We went once for a pre-birthday cocktail date and we weren't very impressed with the menu or how they tasted. The second time we went for my birthday dinner with friends later in the week and it was pretty disappointing.

"Service here is top notch. However, the food was not. I came here for brunch on a saturday hoping to get the famous weekend brunch and was very disappointed to find out that brunch is only served on Sundays. We ordered a la carte and the avocado salad was just avocados with rice crispy treats on it. I was a little confused and still hungry so I ordered the cheesesteak which was definitely tastier but also the most expensive cheesesteak I've had....so all in all, don't come here hungry unless your ready to dish out some cash!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Hit or miss! First time I went, it was with a new person, and I was impressed. I think we were both confused if it was a date or just a hang out... Either way, the first time around I liked the food enough to want to revisit!  Several months later I went with my current boyfriend (different man) as a treat for his promotion and unfortunately discovered that my first experience had over-exaggerated the flavors of the food in my mind. He loves prosciutto so we ordered the Prosciutto di Parma and found it very salty! We make this dish at home sometimes, but I had to eat twice as much melon to counterbalance the salt and we quickly ran out of melon.  He also loves broccolini so we ordered the Broccolini with capers. Same story! The broccolini was cooked to an almost burnt crisp and covered in salt... I found it hard to eat and could only really get through it with the complimentary foccacia. I don't send food back, but perhaps I should have. I was embarrassed, but my boyfriend was being a good sport about it all!  We ordered the Maitake Mushroom (with extra arugula) and Pepperoni Pizzas. Other than the fact that the pepperoni pizza was dripping in grease, it was tasty, but not the best.   I don't know if it's because we were there on a Wednesday night and the A-team wasn't in the kitchen, but I was not impressed by the food, only the service and the atmosphere.  The bar is great and the staff is great, but I will not be returning for the food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I'll start with saying the 20oz Wagyu ribeye was amazing. The sides are not good. We had the Mac n cheese and Augratin potatoes. The croissant like bread they brought had little to no taste , like cardboard really. Apparently the bartender working had no idea how to make an Old Fashioned, it tasted much like cough medicine.

"Normally I would give a venue like this a 4, due to the great attributes like the vibe, the friendly staff the fair pricing, the craft/local beer and the all around pleasant experience. In order to explain my 3 star I suppose I must admit it's just my taste in venue/food. The food is pretty solid, beer is cold and tastey, people were awesome...the vibe is a little franchisey...:just is, maybe it's because it just so damn popular and busy. Certainly it isn't the staff, they are down to earth and fun. The food, maybe that's why I went three. You see the food is ok, I think I'm just basic. I think I just enjoy the chips at Chevys so damn much these were tough to enjoy more. The salsa here was superb. The gauc was top quality. Maybe I just wasn't blown away with the tacos.

"The food here is good, the service is courteous and personable, the portions are too big. Complaining about large portions sounds insane, until you order anything off the Joey B's menu.  What's even worse, management decided that they didn't want anyone splitting these massive coma-inducing plates of food, so that's not allowed unless you pay an additional fee. This is sillyness, and the only place I've been where that is the case in this price range, I mean, it's not fine-dining we're talking about here.  It's American - Italian.  Anyway, definitely arrive hungry, the food won't disappoint.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
I've heard about the long waits for the other Acme Oyster House locations so I was super excited there were no lines for this one. I already had raw oysters at a different restaurant during my trip so I wanted to try Acme's chargrilled ones. The oysters were a little small and had A LOT of garlic. Might be a good dish right before any vampire tours ;) Will stick to raw oysters going forward.  We also ordered the Boo Fries which are fries topped with roast beef gravy and cheese. I actually really enjoyed this... I LOVE fries! I didn't really taste the roast beef flavor in the gravy though. The Chicken & Andouille Gumbo was pretty decent. It was a nice break from all the seafood we've been eating.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Yay! My first review! Okay, so I went to Red Lobster with my sister and her boyfriend for lunch yesterday. Technically, it was more like Linner, because it was 3:30, but what can I say? We're rockstars. Anyway, we decided to get anything and everything we wanted and share. First, of course, we got a basket of cheese biscuits. At first we were confused why a table of three would get four biscuits, but I just woofed my first one down and took the extra. They are a reason in itself to go to Red Lobster. Next, we shared the Lobster Artichoke Seafood dip...and weren't too impressed. It was really liquidy and tasted more like oregano than anything else. I got an order of snow crab legs (amazing), shrimp fettucini alfredo (super amazing), and garlic-grilled shrimp (also amazing). My sister and her boyfriend also got lobster, which they loved, and stuffed flounder which I tried and was fairly happy with, except it tasted more stuffed than flounder. Our service was really awesome, but if it wasn't for a gift card, our bill would have been kind of outrageous. So if you decide to head to Red Lobster, be prepared to dish out some cash. But all-in-all, I'd say it's worth it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"So-so in most respects. Service was friendly and attentive. The ambience is neither here or there and it didn't seem as nice on the inside as I'd pictured it after driving by it hundreds of times. Beer selection appears to be decent but not amazing and when we went they had four different pumpkin beers on tap which I found to be rather redundant. The onion rings are really great, though the ""secret sauce"" that came with it appears to be a simple sriracha mayo or the like (it was fine anyway). I was not so happy with the Cubano I ordered--the bread was really stale. Since I don't live very close to it I'd say it's a one and done for me. Not a bad place but it doesn't really measure up to the best gastropubs in the city and I'm surprised it's generated such a buzz.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Wandering through the epicenter of Bourbon Street's drunken tourist crowds one has to marvel at the mix of culinary options.  From high brow to low brow the eateries run the gamut of possibilities. Perhaps not the highest end restaurant in that section of the French Quarter, Bourbon House is a good place to go for a nice meal where the guest's attire ranges from casual to formal, the food ranges from fair to very good, and the confusing array of servers hovers around the table like well-dressed bees.    If you like to be served you will love Bourbon House, because there is a server for every purpose.  They are, of course, all very attentive and polite, but so numerous I felt guilty that I couldn't remember if I was talking to the one who took my order or the one who brought the food or the one who placed my napkin on my lap.  Fortunately, they were as unrattled as I was perplexed.  Bless them.  We started our dinner with the La Postolle Merlot from Chile.  The menu showed a 2007, but had not been updated for the 2008.  It had a spicy and fruity flavor with a hint of orange peel.  Unfortunately, the bottle arrived at the same time as our appetizer, the calamari, and caused a delay in eating, so that the calamari was luke warm by the time we got to it.  Luke warm fried calamari turned out to be a little greasy, but the meat was tender.  The sauce accompanying the calamari was just a little too spicy, though probably by our standards rather than New Orleans standards.  (IMO, when the spice drowns out the food, it's simply too much of a good thing.)    At the outset of the meal, the servers brought a bag of bread with butter.  The bread was tasty with a crisp outside and soft inside.  It was just beginning to succumb to staleness, which was too bad, because it had clearly been very good at one time.  For a soup course we ordered the Crab & Corn Soup and the Crab Creole soup.  The Crab & Corn soup had a good balance of flavors, but thank goodness for the chive garnish because it was otherwise wanting for a good finish on the palate.  The Crab Creole was so spicy as to drown out the taste of the crab, but it did have an interesting smoky flavor.  For dinner we had the Glazed Chicken, which was well cooked and juicy.  The sweet potatoes with andouille sausage and bourbon was disappointing.  The bourbon drowned out the other flavors and the mash was overly sweet with an alcohol aftertaste.  The greens however were excellent with a good balance of sweetness and tanginess, and little bits of bacon.  We also had the ribeye steak, which had a wonderful grilled flavor accented with a mushroom red wine reduction.  At medium-rare it was tender and juicy.  For dessert we tried their bread pudding with chocolate.  It smelled as wonderful as a fudge shop and the bourbon and molten chocolate were a good balance.  The breading, however, was a little too tough and chewy.  Though I've been to this restaurant several years ago, I didn't remember it as being remarkable for anything other than the confusing service.  It's probably not as remarkable as it should be for the price one pays, but I wouldn't steer anyone away either.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Also, the spicy cucumbers are simple and delicious, and Tofu Bites and Crispy Green Beans are my regular orders.   However, I recently veered from the norm and ordered the chicken bowl and was put off by the Nuac Mam Carmel that coated the chicken. It had a burnt sugar  taste so much so I did not eat the bowl.

Imagine my surprise when I called and was told that they didn't make beans because it was Father's Day!! What? And the potatoes were to replace the beans and rice. ?? While I appreciate trying to save the world from flatulence on Father's Day. I am sad that they didn't tell me or take the dish off the menu. It clearly states beans and rice.

"I own business up the road and the wife has wanted to stop in here for a while. Decided to bring her up for our anniversary a few days ago. Findings are below, to make it quick - it was fair - won't be going back.   Started with a cocktail or two. Ambiance and people were nice, I personally can't stand the 'communal' type seating with a shared bench and people sitting right next to me, this place isn't that special to pack people in like that. Heard the specials and ordered the mozz and tomato and normica flatbread for apps. Mozz was pretty special, flatbread was mediocre.   Ordered a pork/meat sauce special and a homemade pasta & seafood combo. I should have known the way she asked if we wanted salads as well that I was in for a shakedown. They bring out the salads, cheese over arugula with oil and balsamic. $22 for 2 flimsy side salads as add ons ! Ridiculous. My dish shows up with the homemade pasta a little too al dente, scallops cut in half to appear like there's more, and 5 ""clams"" that were actually cockles and hardly appropriate amount. It was a fair dish that could have been done great. My wife had some pork special, pretty much a plate of meat sauce with a side of pasta - later I see this dish was $38.....I can't stand places that pitch specials, and then grossly overcharge you for them since no one wants to ask him much when ordering go dinner. Then tag on an $11 side salad that they offer to you....  Homemade tiramisu for desert, very good and saved this place to a 3.

"New Orleans Birthday Trip = Last Lunch in NOLA  On our way out of town, we took a sidetrip. I really can't explain Deanie's in any other way than, fresh and, well, local. Locals go here, this is sort of the typical lunch/dinner place for Nawlin's middle class. Good deep-fried Southern food.  Food: I don't think you can find a think on Deanie's menu that isn't deep-fried. We started with the crawfish tails, were were spicy and, well, a bit too battered for me. I'd have like the boiled just fine. Those potatoes though, the ones they offer you like a bread basket--little russets of glory, that's what they are. Small round and delicious. I could have survived just off them.  The catfish dinner platter and something else fired was up next. I can't even remember what it was, but let me tell you there was nothing green involved. I seriously needed some fiber after eating here--and we both actually were sick a few days later once all the fried food was processed. I don't blame Deanie's for it, but the fact that neither one of us eats fried food on a regular basis.   Still, it was damn tasty going down. Not in a way that it was an explosion of flavor in your mouth, but in the way that McD's is amazing or that you can't stop eating that bag of chips. Sinfully good. If you're craving something deep fried and golden, Deanie's is your place. If you're looking for those restaurants that the typical Oreleanians eat at, Deanie's is a good representation. It's not Commander's Palace all the time--just like I don't eat out at celebrity chef restaurants every night in NYC. (Mostly, I order in.....)  Venue: Apparently, Deanie's moved. It used to be out on the lake, and now it's a few blocks back. And apparently, it's busier than it use to be. I guess this used to be a very local, middle class spot, and now it's almost.... touristy? Well, we ended up there, but only because one of us used to live in NOLA, so I can't be blamed. We had to drive around the parking lot for a bit, to be sure.  The restaurant is actually closer to a diner than anything else, from the outside most definitely, and the inside is only slightly nicer. Carpets at least, and lots of tables they'll squish you into. The bar was pretty empty though, so we went and grabbed some Turbo Dogs while waiting for our table. You could tell that for some this was ""eating out,"" especially since we were there for Father's Day lunch.

"This is a review of drinks at the bar.  We stopped in here for some pre-party drinks before the Yelp awards. I think I was here ages ago (over 10 years) for dinner, but I can't really remember. I digress. We sat at the bar and decided to get a beer and a cranberry and vodka. The draft was down, so I had to get a bottled beer, which wasn't really an issue. When it was time to get the check it came to $16 for just those two drinks. Now, keep in mind there was house vodka in the mixed drink and I had a local beer.  I get it- I'm in tourist country. These places are going to charge what they know they can get from out-of-towners. And I guess it wouldn't have left such a bad taste in my mouth if I had been able to get the draft beer I wanted in the first place. I wouldn't have even minded the price if the place was a little fancier (Galatoire's, Arnaud's, etc.), but it felt like a bit of a rip off considering this is a ""walk in off the street"" kind of establishment.

"| The Chronic...Tacos |  C.T. is similar to other made to order Mexican influenced chains like Chipotle and Moe's. The difference is they have more options like Chronic fries, breakfast tacos/burritos, and churro bites. I ordered a small burrito and it was good. I really enjoyed that Spanish rice was an option and they also had Baja sauce which tastes good if you like spicy toppings. I appreciate that Chronic T is a new contender in the Latin fusion food realm. Overall my burrito was tasty but nothing special.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"While I was in tampa for work, decided to swing by here have me a brewski!  I started off with an Iron Rat Imperial Stout and it was pretty good! I bold and robust with flavor. I got some really great hints of coffee. I had 2 of these stouts.  When the hunger struck I ordered their, lunch special, meatball sub on Cuban bread. I feel like this was my classic case of choosing the wrong dish. they had a lot of cuban inspired dishes but I wanted something DIFFERENT. The sub was ok, I just wasn't to crazy about the texture of the meat balls.

"Eh so so.  That's the best description of my experience here.  I've eaten at most of the city's higher end eateries and actually write a food blog about those experiences so I feel at least semi qualified to comment on my experience here.  Pros: -Service was very good.  Pleasant server with the unique phrase ""Cheers"" after serving any of our drinks.  -the almond sweet potatoes were fantastic -ambiance was up to par.  Exactly what you would expect in a ""high end"" restaurant.   Cons: -For being a ""steak house"" the steak was sub par. Save your money (more on this later) and go to Del Friscos.  Dry steak, not too much flavor, and the only signature presentation was that it is served sizzling on your plate.  That's all well and good but I'd rather have a better tasting steak.  -Expense.  Dinner for two came to $180. Kind of steep considering the meal was not all that good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The pork belly pastor and the braised pork tacos were delicious...the mole one was .  I understand we were in Nashville, but I feel like $4 for street  is a little expensive...but it is what it is.

"More like 3 1/2 stars. This small very casual restaurant does a big take out business for locals. As we ate dinner, we watched customers come and go for pickups and take out. We were the only eat in diners for the first thirty minutes. It's good if you're looking for a less expensive, quieter place with no ambience and some decent seafood.  The cup portion of seafood gumbo was some small shrimp and pieces of okra with a bit of white rice in a broth. The gumbo came with packages of saltines. Although there wasn't much seafood in it, the broth part was very very flavorful.  I wasn't that hungry so I just asked for two soft shell crabs without bread, sides etc.  At $6.50 each, the price was right. They came lightly battered and fried on a bed of shredded lettuce with lemon wedges and both cocktail and tartar sauce. They were medium in size and just what I was craving.   You order at the counter and they deliver your food to you. Sodas are taken from the cooler -- you can request cups of ice to go with them.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Five chicken ravioli with garlic sauce for $15. It's appropriate The Tuscan Tomato is next door to a movie theater, because it's Campo: The Sequel. Master Chef Jacob Gordon: You or someone on your staff seems to be Yelp aware, given all the five-star, one-hit wonder reviews posted about The Tuscan Tomato. Go to Campo and use the option to sort by date and look at all the brutal reviews Campo got for its expensive pasta when it first opened. That's going to be you. And the bad reviews are going to stick around, unlike these others that are going to get filtered. You need to tell your customers up front that the $15 ravioli dish only gets you five ravioli. Also check out Campo owner Mark Estee's blog where he threw up the white flag after running the gauntlet of brutal Yelp reviews over his high-priced pasta. This pricing at Tuscan Tomato may be priced in anticipation of using Groupon. I don't know. And what's worse, I probably should have sent the raviolis back. The garlic was overwhelming from the start. I kind of felt dumb complaining about the strong garlic flavor when the menu clearly says it's served with a garlic cream sauce. Except this was more like a GARLIC! cream sauce. And by the end of the third one, the salt was also overwhelming. Considering price and execution, this was a one-star dish. I started with a calamari appetizer with a yellow pepper coulis for dipping. The calamari was okay, not great. This may be a good job of making the coulis. I don't remember having it before. But I didn't like it. It tasted too mustardy. Others may like it. I was able to add a side salad for $3. This was a nice mix of fresh ingredients, although the tomatoes used in this dish seemed like the supermarket tomatoes that look good but but don't taste good. I wasn't sure about getting dessert, but I'm glad I did. It was the best part of the meal. The cheesecake was delicious. The papaya and strawberry salsa was fresh and tasty. It shows there's some real talent in the kitchen. I got there for a late lunch. There's no bread served at lunch. There's a sourdough bread served for dinner. The service was also excellent, My server spoke intelligently about all the food on the menu. The standard uniform for the staff, men and women, is black pants, white shirt, red tie and fedora. I saw no wines by the glass I wanted to buy. They have some nice wine by the bottles and the mark up is more reasonable than other Reno restaurants. There's 17 four-seat tables inside and a couple of tables outside. The Tuscan Tomato is new and they deserve a chance to work out the kinks. But right now they don't seem to be on course to put a successful restaurant in that spot.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The Cuban food at Columbia Cafe (behind the Tampa History Center) is average. But you don't go for the food, you go for the outdoor atmosphere by the water (similar to Jacksons). For me, this is a good place to come with your dog, sit outside, listen to music, and have a pitcher of sangria with tapas. On Friday's and Saturdays there usually is a saxophone player or some live music. It's a nice place to have a relaxing lunch or evening while the sun sets, or a nice place to go to before you go to an event in town.   If you decide to eat indoors, expect to sit in a place that looks like a large hallway of the history center. Definitely ask to sit outside.   I've gone here several times. The service has been mixed. Some servers are attentive and some you rarely see come outside to help you.  Devil crab- We liked this. Lots of crab and worth it.  Champinones Rellenos, Shrimp ""Al Ajilos"", Calamares, bread & butter, black bean soup, Gazpacho, fried plantains, empanadas, (all of them) grouper sandwich- all these tapas/dishes were nothing to rave about but sufficient for the $.   Chicken and rice - Dry but large portion.   Jamon, Chorizo y Manchego - Basically a cold cheese plate. Chorizo not as good quality and the plate is small. For the $, it's okay.  Toro Sangria pitcher (red) - This is really good here. Order many of these and hang out outside. Note that if you order by the glass it's a slightly different recipe. The pitcher is better and they also make it table side.  Basically again, if you are looking for top notch (corrected typo) food, this isn't it (although, I hear that the main Columbia in Ybor is very good).

"First let me say I am not a huge fan of French food.  However, my dining partner wanted to try La Belle Epoque for the crepes, and I'm not one to turn down trying a different restaurant, so we went early on a Saturday and we both had crepes.  I had the bacon/brie/fresh basil crepe, my dining partner had the crepe w/goat cheese, spinach, tomatoes, and onions.  My crepe was OK.  There was nothing at all wrong with it.  It was expertly prepared, but it just was a bit heavy for me - all that cheese and bacon was a bit much - I took half of it home.  On the other hand, my dining partner raved about her crepe - and it DID look really good.    For dessert we both had the berry crepes, and they were to DIE for!  Excellent mix of blackberry, blueberry and raspberries mixed together, almost like a jam or pie filling.  The crepes were perfect, and the whole thing was topped w/a little whipped cream and some powdered sugar - outstanding!!!    The service was very good.  Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and efficient.  The physical building is a bit older, but the silverware, plates, glasses, napkins and tableclothes were immaculately clean.    As I said, I'm not a fan of French food, but if you are, or if you want to try it, this is a good place to go.

"Came with a friend on opening day, hoping to be lucky and snag a free lunch. No such luck, the place was pretty packed. The line was pretty long, but they seemed to keep everything moving relatively quickly. plenty of workers expediting and turning over tables.   It's ""fast casual"" and you get a buzzer for your order which is always nice. The pickup counter is kind of in an awkward location, near where people sit, where people grab their utensils and sauces, and where people are exiting the order line. High traffic area.  I got a bowl with paneer cheese, basmati rice, tikka masala, and some naan. My friend got a BBQ bowl as well, with tofu and veggies, basmati rice, chickpea masala, and again, some naan. We took our order to-go and dined back at the office.   We both went a little HAM packing up small containers of their sauces. I like all things spicy, so was super pumped that they had a ""fire"" and a ""lava"" sauce. They also had a mango sauce that was a nice break from the super spicy. There was also mint sauce and two others that I didn't really utilize.   Our masalas didn't have any hints of spiciness, so my guess is they make the masala pretty neutral so you can kick it up with their hot sauces if necessary.   The food was good, and the service was fantastic. I also felt like this place was more like 'casual' Indian food? (Not sure if that makes sense) In other words, if the concept of Indian food seems daunting to you, maybe start here.

"Before they blew up and became Cafe Madison next door, the space that is now Towne Tavern was the Madison Pub. I used to go with a friend every once in a while for a chocolate martini or three and some catch-up. At the time, they had several different chocolate martinis on their menu and some came with a Hershey kiss at the bottom which sealed the deal for me.   My brother had a gift card for the family of restaurants so we decided to check out Towne Tavern for drinks on Saturday night. The bar looked exactly the same but I didn't see any chocolate martinis on the current menu. I'm wondering if they put that menu at the newer, fancier Cafe Madison.    Only a couple tables were open when we waked in so we grabbed a booth and checked out the menu. The beer selection was really weak, though they did have Flying Fish HopFish on tap. My brother's girlfriend had a couple different flavored martinis that she said were okay but not super strong.   The crowd was mixed and by 10pm or so, we were one of the only tables left, outside of the people sitting at the bar. They had a guy singing and playing guitar who was decent, but the bar is so small that it was also a little awkward.   Our server, Holly, was a peach.* She kept the drinks flowing and stopped by at the right times to make sure were were all set.

"Say what you want, but I love me some Sonic. Granted, this is definitely far from what I would consider a stellar Sonic location.  Strangely, the drive-thru part lacked a window. I was so confused. Since I was just getting drinks, I opted for the drive-thru, instead of the drive-in, part. I ordered through the speaker thingy. I pulled around. And nothing. There was no window. Instead, you just pull straight up and wait and they bring it out. Might as well of just done the drive-in. And there's a serious lack of signage explaining that you should stop / pull up to here / whatever.  And it was even stranger when each day the prices seemingly changed. And no, it wasn't happy hour or anything. On Saturday at 5:00pm, a Route 44 limeade and a regular limeade were $5 something. On Sunday at 9:00am, a Route 44 limeade and a large limeade were $4 something. A bigger drink and it was cheaper? Am I missing something here?  And I was rather put off when instead of handing me my change, the car-hop asked if I wanted my change. I usually just tell them to keep the change, but you shouldn't assume and ask me if I want it.

"Went to Adolfo's while looking for a place to eat near DBA and Spotted Cat. There didn't seem to be too many other options in the area and we were getting pretty hungry (read: didn't take time to look around a whole lot) Dining area was quaint and comfortable. Servers were professional and efficient. Food: we had the fish with ocean sauce (clams, shrimp, crabmeat sauce) and fish with lemon-spinach/crab sauce. The ocean sauce, which was recommended by the server was a little too much a jumble of different flavors. They didn't blend into a dish by themselves. The lemon-spinach sauce however was much better and complemented the grouper we got very well. We had the pasta sides which was nothing to write home about. They had an Ok selection of wines by the glass. Overall, an OK dining experience. Not unhappy eating there in that neighborhood because we didn't see too much else. I woudn't go out of my way to come here though.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
Good food and a great place to meet friends due to its accessible location. I'd give an even higher rating if there were more healthy options on the menu. On a splurge day their fries are very good and the warm chocolate chip cookie and ice cream dessert is generous enough to share with a table of four.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I like their chicken, it's something different then what I'm used to. I liked their BBQ sauce but the honey mustard was too seasoned or strong. Although there wasn't any trash all over the floor and it's smelled okay, the bathrooms need work, the toilet barely flushed and the skin wasn't draining.

My go to diner for lunch when I'm working in the Wilmington area. I usually choose the special of the day. Soup and sandwich combos are usually the best choice.  The service is always good and fast if your looking to grab lunch and get back to work.   Today was no different with one problem. We asked the the bread be toasted. I don't send food back.

Gone are the days that people would fly into Tampa to come to this particular restaurant. It's a good meal but not one that I can particularly write home about. They weren't busy on a Sunday night but we did put in a reservation just in case. We got a couple of different appetizers and some steak items and pasta dishes. It is a casual Italian spot back in the day you would run into a lot of Yankees players not so much anymore.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"In the grand landscape of gaming, there rages a war.  A war that runs deeper than Pathfinder vs. D&D, deeper than Amerithrash vs. Eurogames, deeper even than Star Wars vs. Star Trek.  I'm talking, of course, of the food scene of GenCon against that of the Origins Game Fair.  And truly, this is a conflict for the ages!  Columbus' phenomenal North Market was answered by Indianapolis' food trucks on Capitol and Georgia.  For every St. Elmo's Steakhouse in downtown Indy, there's an upscale bistro in Columbus' Short North neighborhood.  Columbus' Elevator Brewing and ""Big Bar on Two"" stand against Indy's storied ""RAM"". And, to match Barley's in Columbus, with their themed pint glasses, there's Scotty's Brewhouse.  Each GenCon, Scotty's transforms from a sports bar into a fully geeked-out haven, complete with fantasy-themed specials and sci-fi classic movies on the numerous TVs.  Sounds like gamer heaven, right?  Alcohol, games, movies, and food?    Well, there are a few issues.    One, as with many restaurants and bars, Scotty's is a long freakin' walk from the Convention Center.  In the hot August sun, that walk is exhausting and often just not worth it, when other options are closer.  I mentioned Barley's up above--they're directly across from the GCCC, which makes grabbing a drink or a burger at Origins much easier than doing the same at Scotty's.  Second, Scotty's tends to be a bit expensive.  Burgers are usually at least $12, with items like bacon and cheese costing extra.  While there are a few economical items on the menu, expect to spend $20 a person, easily.  Again, I can't help but compare this to Barley's, who offers a number of Origins specials that are significantly cheaper.  Thirdly, the food's just not that great.  I mean, it's okay.  It's certainly better than anything you'd get at a major chain, but at the same time...it's just *there*.  The focus is definitely more on the beer and mixed drink selection, despite the voluminous menu.  Further, there seems to be a fixation on ghost peppers on the menu; at least 6-7 menu items featured ghost peppers, which seems to be a bit much, considering the heat coming with those little buggers.  Why not something cheap and bar-friendly like a poutine or a meat pie?  Irish stew maybe?  Nothing of the sort in sight.  I'm sure I'll be back to Scotty's at some point.  It's a GenCon mainstay, no doubt, but for me?  I'll choose Origins and Barley's over it every time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
This review is purely based on the drinks only. We stopped by for a company social event and ordered variety of drinks. I went with the Mojito and I felt it did not have any flavor to it.

This was about 1:00 PM so hopefully lunch rush delays over. Nope!  One car ahead of me with a couple elderly ladies. They were very slow. I assumed they were just confused or hadn't made up their minds about what to order. After a bunch of time they finally pulled to window and I pulled up to order.  Now I knew exactly what I wanted and how I wanted it but first thing I was told ""Be with you in a moment."" After a few minutes the voice came back. Now I could have said ""I want this sub with this bread with these ingredients."" But the girl taking orders was a trainee. Every individual choice was asked, one at a time. And then all repeated for my wife's sub.  In all, from the time I pulled into drive through until I pulled away with my food, was 22 minutes. Food was great, as always.

"Craving some chinese after work, and ran across this restaurant on google maps and it seemed to have decent reviews. First I'll say this is not all for me. Sesame chicken combo, fried dumplings, crab Rangoon and shrimp lo mein. Unfortunately the only thing I really liked was the sesame chicken, great flavor and portions. Oddly I did get a piece with a bone so just be a bit cautious when you bite into it. Everything else was just bland and the crab rangoon wasn't creamy at all along with the sweet and sour sauce is way too sweet.

"I've been to 7th and Grove twice (once pre- pandemic and just 1 week ago) and honestly, I'm really having a difficult time understanding the 4 and 5 Star reviews. I want to love this place. I mean I REALLY want to love this place. The decor is HOT! I love the plush seating in the bar lounge, the murals on the walls, the instagram worthy picture wall, and the overall aesthetics  of the place...however... the two times that I've been to 7th & Grove,  the service has been ridiculously slow and neither time was I there during a busy time.    The first time, we went to get dessert and cocktails. I have to admit, every craft cocktail that I've ever had there has been delicious. They are expertly crafted and made to perfection! It just takes sooooo d*** long to get them! We waited for our drinks about 20-25  minutes!  It took even longer to  bring out the desserts. Almost 45 minutes! When we could catch a waitress, we kept being told that someone will be over... Well, my sweet tooth was gone but when the desserts came,  I managed to push through :-) We ordered two desserts... the Red Light Special - red velvet cake with a cheesecake filling and cream cheese icing. Sounds good right?  Well, I wouldn't know because it came out half frozen.  Arghh..The Beautiful Ones - a caramel bread pudding sheet cake with raisins was tasty though. I did not rush to come back.   The second time I went, I came with a fabulous group of ladies.  Girl time! We had a reservation in the club area. So, again with the long wait for drinks.  Some of us waited over 30 minutes for our drinks.  A few of the ladies went up to the bar and reminded them that they had ordered drinks.  WTF? I wanted to start off with an appetizer of the watermelon barbecue wings which sounds pretty doggone delicious and one of my table mates ordered the lemon zest wings. The waitress said it would take 40 minutes to come out. Again, WTF!? Did they have to chase down a few of those wild Ybor chickens!? We were there for awhile so we ended up ordering them along with the mac and cheese, the Rude Boi, the Ox Tails, and the deviled eggs. The two entrees were yummy.  The deviled eggs were okay.  The chicken wings were fried hard and were a little too dry for my taste.    Both times that I've gone, the waitresses have been so amazingly sweet and they take the time to explain the menu. But I have to say the vibrant decor, great cocktails, good music, and friendly staff can not make up for the inconsistent food quality and extremely slow service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The original WOB - woah (high expectations)!  1.)  The kitchen is smaller, so don't expect them to offer same Happy Hour deals as Westshore or other larger locations. For example, I was really in the mood for Mac & Cheese Bites, but they don't serve them here.   A.) The Margherita Flatbread was drizzled with balsamic vinaigrett with a sprinkling of arugula, fresh diced tomatoes & pesto. For $7, it was def. the right price. B.) I did have to get up from the high top table where I was sitting w/my friend to the bar area to order my second Happy Hour beer (FL Ave. Brewing - FL Lager) & my friend's Moscow Mule with only a couple min. left.   They do get busy! It's a smaller location & I think they are spread thin because our waiter was taking care of us & the bar area. I feel like WOB always tests my patience - 15 to 20 min. just to get a take out container with waiters walking by that I had to flag down!   I like it, but I was not totally in love with my experience and I will only return during Happy Hour!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Initially, we were captivated by the beautiful entrance and had cute chimes made out of old utensils. The reason for the low rating is because when we got the smoothies they were bland and felt like it was just frozen berries with water.

The suite is small but oozing with German memorabilia, however didn't sense the same  cultural essence from the staff.  Highlight the vanilla ice cream with the strudel & the chocolate cake.

"Truth be told, while we had a nice dinner, it wasn't Half Moon Cafe, which was truly a special place that had been in the location for years. We went in with an open mind and were hopeful, but it simply couldn't match up with what we have become accustomed to. The redesign is nice, and the place is more open, light and airy. The service was fine, and on a Saturday at the beginning of the dinner rush we were seated promptly and everyone was attentive. The beer list is somewhat less impressive than Half Moon had, as they had more draft choices but also less remarkable stuff. We started with the crabby pretzel and the OMG nachos...both were good, and we enjoyed. Alas, the crab nachos from Half Moon were among the better appetizers ANYWHERE so sadly these couldn't come close. Honestly, Kennett Brewing Company has better nachos. The pretzel was solid, though. Dinner wise both my lovely wife and I had lobster rolls, and they were good. Not exceptional, but good. Dessert was a pass glancing at the menu, and my wife enjoyed her cocktail. With Kennett being a solid 45 minutes from us, we would likely head to either Victory, Kennett Brewing, Two Stones or Taqueria Morleone the next time we are in town. A shame Half Moon had to close, it is a real loss. Maybe we will check out Grain again, it just had a whole lot to live up to and couldn't do it, at least not yet.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Meh. Fair. The GF was craving pizza. I wanted to watch playoff football. We had never been to PW. We compromised by sitting at the bar and watching the game. The old joke goes something like........ Pizza is like sex. Even if it's bad, it's still pizza. I am in no way, shape or form equating pizza to my sex life (Love ya , honey) but let me just say I was not wowed.  Chicago deep dish is my favorite style so I tend to favor Pi/Lemmon's/Black Thorn for my pizza choices. But being a big fat guy, I have come across few pizzas I wouldn't make friends with. If you are looking for brick oven ""neopolitan"" style pizza (which is what they serve), I think The Good Pie in Midtown does it better.  The space is cool. The open kitchen concept is always appreciated to include a large strategically placed mirror that lets you see your pizza being prepared. The bar is small and kinda seems weirdly placed.

Issues ranged from forgetting drinks multiple times to forgetting an entree & the server having to ask what he forgot for one of us to a food runner dropping a canoli & having it land on my sweater, lap, shoe & partly on the table & floor.  A quick apology was murmured & another napkin was brought out so I could clean up myself & the table & they didn't even take the dropped canoli away, it just sat crumbled up in a plate until the table was cleared.

"Wayback Burgers is a nice addition to the area but the food was not as good as I expected.   I ordered online which was easy and fast. My food was ready for pick up in about 10 minutes. The milkshake was made when I arrived so it was cold, thick and full of flavour. I would recommend trying the shake although I've had better shakes elsewhere (Red Robin, Fatburger, etc). The shake was the best part of the combo order.   You read that right. I wasn't that impressed overall. The combo includes a burger, side and drink with the discount being some savings on the drink. In addition to the strawberry banana shake, I ordered a single patty burger with pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, pickle, onion, fried onion, mushrooms, mayo and Wayback Gold Sauce. It was messy but not a bad messy. Probably could have done with either the mayo or the gold sauce rather than both. If I go again, I would probably try a different sauce all together. Mushrooms seemed canned rather than fresh so I would skip those next time. The bun was fine. The meat was fine. The cheese was fine and so forth. There are better fast food burgers out there but I would order it again and try other toppings before ever ordering onion rings again.   You read that right. The onion rings were just gross. A gooey interior mixed with a smooth, unappealing exterior easily made these the weakest element. Mushy, oily and bland are not want I want in an onion ring.

The atmosphere is unique, especially for Tampa, but I am coming in to eat and that is why I was underwhelmed.

I went for lunch during the week and found the place to be full with moms having a sex and the city moment with their girlfriends while toting around their little bundles of joy.  Maybe they were so engrossed in the conversation that they didn't realize how small the portions were and the quality was just average.  My meal came out so quickly I questioned how much of it was pre-made instead of freshly prepared.

"This place is A-OK meh more like B-OK.  Everything was adequate, its just that in that small area you have Chipotle, Baja Fresh, Qdoba, and la michoacana.  They couldn't have picked a worst place to build.   anyway this place is similar to Qdoba in that they have like 7 ingredients which their entire menu is based on.

Honestly, the chicken did not taste like quality chicken--at all....and my tummy isnt feeling too well at the moment. Matt loved his pho, so no complaints there. The spring rolls were o-k.

"The staff was very friendly and the food tastes really good for the most part. For starters, the server was shocked when I asked for a double shot cafe con leche. She said the cafe con leche isnt made with espresso. I didnt argue it, but the Cuban style cafe con leche certainly does! The cafe con leche was good but we had to add a shot of espresso to it to give it the Cuban flavor. We ordered the ropa vieja with rice and black beans, maduros, and a Cuban sandwich. When the server asked us if we wanted light mayo on the sandwich we looked at each other perplexed. The traditional Cuban sandwich does not have mayonnaise. What was even more shocking was when the Cuban sandwich arrived and there was lettuce and tomatoes on it! As a Cuban that's  borderline offensive. It made sense when I spoke to one of the only Spanish employees there, who explained the only Cuban that works there happens to be the cashier. The owners are Colombian! The rice, beans, maduros, and ropa vieja were good but there was a tiny amount of meat and a huge portion of rice and beans. For dessert we ordered the guayaba and cheese pastry. It was guayaba substitute with a heaping amount of pillsbury flake crust. The flan was decent but, once again, lacking the Cuban creaminess and style. Overall, I had to rate it 3 stars because it's not terrible tasting food. The establishment is clean and the employees are friendly but this is not the traditional Cuban food spot you were searching for.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
I have to say.. My food was amazing.. But not enough of it. I could have eaten dbl. what they served me.  I'm a little girl too. Our server was not attentive.. She never even told us her name.. She was rushing us all night. The runner delivered  to 4 of us.. Then we sat waiting for the other 2 to get there meals and I had to flag our server down to find out what was going on.  Then we got out check and I figured out that the grat. was added on.. No wonder she didn't care about our service. I wish I knew her name.. She was wearing red heart shaped dangling earrings...

"Ok Szechuan Tasty House...  Here we go. Because I just recently moved, I am and have been (for two months) relying on Yelp to point me in the right direction of the best delivery food in the area I've moved to.  That being said, Yelpers pointed me in the direction of STH. I read countless reviews, gathered ideas on popular dishes, and called to make it happen.  I ordered the Three Pepper Chicken, Spring Rolls, Vegetable & Bean Curd soup, and some Steamed Dumplings.   I called at 7:04pm and the food didnt get to my house til after 830pm.  The woman on the telephone said it could take 50-55 minutes for delivery.  Ok. I called back after 830, and the woman on the telephone apologized and said she'd call the delivery guy.  The delivery guy called 5 minutes later and showed up around 845.  He, too, apologized.  I still tipped him because you never know what could have happened in the interm, and I wanted to keep an open mind after all the great reviews. Wellllll... Worried that I'd open the bag to find luke warm food-WRONG!  The food was hot as it would be had it took any less time.  The three pepper chicken was damn good.  If you like spicy stuff, ORDER THIS!  The dumplings were pretty tasty too.  The spring rolls were a little bit greasy.  The soup was a-ok. I will order again.

"O'Sake is a good option for a quick sushi lunch or for takeout. The restaurant is casual and the service is pretty good. I'm a little torn over this review because nothing about this visit was bad but also nothing was so good that it was that memorable.   Ambiance: 3/5 Small restaurant, traditionally decorated and simple. Seating at the sushi bar and tables.   Service: 3/5 Server was nice and checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Brought the check without asking us if we were done or before asking us if we were ready for it, which wasn't a big deal but I like when servers ask and aren't in a hurry to turn over the table.   Food: 4/5 The two roll all-day special is a great deal. For $11 you can get a miso soup and your choice of two of their basic sushi rolls. I subbed the miso soup for a salad ($1 for the sub) which I was glad I did since the dressing on the salad was great. I got an Alaska roll and a crunch shrimp roll. Each roll has 8 pieces and the plate is served with the usual wasabi and ginger. The Alaska roll was my favorite with avocado and fresh, melt-in-your-mouth salmon. The crunch shrimp had tempura shrimp pieces and crunchy tempura flakes in it. It needed some sort of fresh element in it but it was okay.   Overall, great bang for your buck on the deals but also not my favorite sushi place I've ever been to. I do like O'Sake over Samurai Sushi which is across the street from this restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We were just there for dinner, last night, on the early side.  Our server was extremely nice, and she was considerate with my tea and not messing up the sweet balance by refilling early.  :)  The food came out a little bit quickly, but we did not request that it be slowed down.  We enjoyed the sampler appetizer (really liked the mac & cheese balls!), but our salads arrived only about half way through the appetizer.  Our dinners arrived about half way through our salads and still had our appetizer.  In any case, the food was all good, the server was nice, management stopped by to check on us, as well.  I think the kitchen might need to work on spacing things out a bit.  This is a new location, so the place looks great, and they may just be working out some kinks, still.

"Sushi in the Midwest? I was skeptical.  Except, this is actually pretty good.   I lived in Hawaii for a long time, so my tastebuds are used to a little different quality.

But considering everything else around here serves deep-fried, covered-in-cheese, iceberg-lettuce-smothered-in-ranch, fat-filled 'merican food... this was a WELCOME relief.   Their rolls are good, tightly packed, not loosey-goosey like some places. Their rice is ok and I thought my unagi was average.   Our server was nice and efficient. I had no trouble getting a table right away for lunch. Service wasn't slow or fast... just average.  The whole place is clean with a nice ambiance.

The fried pickles, which they were advertising were not the best. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their paninis, burgers, etc.Seemed like a nice, family atmosphere for a Sunday night. The servers seemed cool with our ever-expanding group- started with 3, and ended up being 11 throughout the night.

"After reading a fairly mixed review for the Blue Duck in the Philadelphia Inquirer, my husband and I decided that we needed to form our own opinion.   I so wanted it to be truly wonderful. Northeast Philadelphia has always been sorely lacking in anything that even remotely resembles a creative and eclectic menu and in truth, I honestly believe that's what the Blue Duck is or rather could be.   Not wanting to take any chances, I made reservations through Yelp but as it turned out, we really didn't need to since it was pretty early and we were seated right away. Our server was bubbly and personable and immediately brought us a bucket with ice and stemless wine glasses for the wine we brought with us. Problem one, how in the world does one carry glasses to a table that are so spotted they boarder on dirty and not notice? The funny thing is, when I was telling my daughter about the incident, she commented that she had experienced the same issue. A little Jet Dry goes a long way for spotless glasses and silverware.  We ordered the Blue Duck fries and they truly do live up the reviews. What could be more delicious and decadent than duck fat and melted gouda? Then throw in some shredded duck and bacon. Worth the calories!  I ordered lobster with a gnocchi shaped pasta and a wonderful tarragon cream sauce. Lobster is a funny thing. Cook it 4 seconds too long and you end up with rubber. This chef knows his way around a lobster because it was cooked perfectly sweet and tender. The pasta was another matter however being somewhat gummy. I would have been happier with linguini or angel hair pasta.   My husband ordered the amberjack with yellow rice and haricot vert. The rice and green beans were actually heavenly. Soft and flavorful with just enough texture for a great mouth feel. The fish, however, was extremely strong tasting and smelling. There were two nice sized portions but I could only take a small taste. My husband, whom I'm never seen refuse any kind of fish, ate about one quarter of one piece. Personal taste preferences I'm sure.  As we sat talking and drinking our wine, I looked around the room which had suddenly filled up to capacity starting at about 5:30. Some of the other dishes coming out of the kitchen definitely looked worth pursuing. The burgers were huge and looked juicy and the wings look great but my preference will always lean toward the kind of cuisine we haven't been able to get in this part of Philadelphia, a thoughtful and creative eclectic menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The space itself is not comfortable at all, with no cozy seating options, and it's rather dim. It is gorgeous, but does not suit to my personal tastes.   The food menu is interesting. I ordered a ricotta toast with honey, orange zest, and pistachio. When I ordered, they were out of ricotta and someone was currently out on a grocery store run, so the wait was longer than it should have been. The toast itself was enjoyable with a heaping pile of ricotta, sweetened with honey, and a salty crunch from the pistachios.

The apple worked well, but was not tart enough to balance out the sweet.  We also go the not-so-japanese roll. My best friend LOVED the bugolgi beef, but it was his first time eating bugolgi beef... The meat was cold maybe luke warm and not as good as i hoped.   And the third roll we go was... er... i forgot.   The space is very nice though.

I also ordered the buffalo chicken wrap (since it comes with a salad) and I figured I could take home both some Of the pizza and the wrap. The wrap was extremely salty. Or maybe it was smothered in too much of the sauce? I even let my boyfriend try it to make sure I wasn't crazy... and he said the same thing. It was more like you were just drinking buffalo sauce with parts in it. I thought maybe they would just put the buffalo sauce on the wrap and add the friend chicken and veggies that came with it so you could still individually taste everything.... so I wound up just finishing the pizza!

"My husband and I were so excited to hear that JA Ramen Curry opened in Tucson.  We are HUGE fans of delicious Japanese Curry (Ramen too when it is cold outside).  We spent a summer in Japan and have missed Japanese Curry for about two years.  I can make it at home but it is very time consuming and difficult to make the pork cutlet without over cooking it.  We came in here on Saturday, 10/26/19 right when they opened at 11am.  The place is super cute and I LOVE the pictures on the wall and atmosphere of the restaurant.  We came in the side door and went up to the front.  An Asian girl with long hair was working the register and did not say anything to us.  We never got a greeting and told her that this was our first time eating here and that we needed to look at the menu.  She handed us two menus and we looked over them.  We asked the girl what she suggested and she said she didn't have a suggestion and that she really had never eaten any of the food.  Mind you, the restaurant had been open about two weeks before our visit.  This girl was very socially awkward and seemed very uncomfortable dealing with the public.  She may just have been really shy but I don't think she should be working the front register because it did not give a very good first impression.  We noticed that their food was a little pricey for a restaurant in Tucson.  I ordered the Double Pork Cutlet Katsu Curry Combination with Rice and it was almost $16.00 just for my dish.  I also noticed that the drinks were priced separately.  My husband ordered the same dish and our friend who was with us ordered a Miso Ramen.  We also ordered Takoyaki.  We were given a little ticket/sign with a number and told they would be bring the food to our table.  We sat down and they brought our Takoyaki to us first.  It was absolutely delicious and even had the Bonito Flakes on them like they did when we ate them in Osaka and Tokyo a couple summers ago.  The Curry dishes came out and they were hot and delicious.  We ordered a spice level of a 5, which was perfect.  Our friend said she really liked the Ramen.  We came here again for a date night about a week later on a Thursday night, and the food was pretty good again, however, the Pork Cutlet was very cold, like it had been sitting out for a while.  It was really quite disappointing.  We ordered the same stuff as a To Go order last Saturday and everything tasted really good.  The staff here for the most seem nice, however, when we came for our date night a couple weeks ago, a man brought out our food (Asian guy and seemed like he might be a manager or owner) and was not in a very good mood.

"I am a local resident and enjoy the atmosphere DiPaolo's brings (gorgeous outside and inside area), except I am not a fan of the consistently increasing prices.  It seems they have really great specials and deals, but slowly raise them after a few weeks.  If the special changed and was offering something different I may understand, but they are simply getting people in there with the lower prices, and then over time jacking them up. The food is good, but not worth the increasing prices. Ex. the prime rib & shrimp buffett used to be $21.95 and was reasonable to bring in a family or for a weeknight date night, but now in a year has been jacked up to $29.95 while offering nothing new! Ex. The crabcake Tuesdays used to be great, they have slowly rose in price nearly $5-$6 in just a few months!  I understand they give you a large portion in regular dining meals, but I do not always need 2 days of leftovers (especially if they are oily when heating).   This has gone from a couple times a month place to when I have a gift certificate place.  If you are not local and coming in this is a very nice place to sit and have a good meal with friends or family. Good food and great antipasto which is free with entrees!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I wanted to love this place and after seeing good reviews I knew I had to try it. My biggest complaint was that everything was way over-salted to a point that it was difficult to enjoy my meal. The kimchi was almost inedible because of how salty it was and lacked vinegar flavor. As an appetizer we split an order of chaoshou dumplings which I thought were very tasty. For my entree had the taiwan beef noodle. This is one of my all time favorite noodle dishes and being a native of Hong Kong, this just didn't measure up to my expectations. I thought the broth was just ok but far too salty. I do love that they make their own noodles though and their beef  brisket was super tender and flavorful.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I understand this is a Nashville tradition, but the culinary appeal of this place is lost on me. Yes the service is great and the pancakes are decent, but I really don't get why anyone would wait in a 1-hour plus line to eat here.   I ordered the silver dollar pancakes and could only eat 2.5 of the 8 they gave me. The cinnamon syrup was delicious, though I'd skip the maple syrup. (Someone at my table thought it seemed too watery to be authentic maple syrup, but who knows.)  The winning flavors at our table were the sweet potato and also the chocolate pancakes. But at 5 pancakes per person, you should definitely get ready to share.  Prices are exceptionally reasonable. My meal only set me back $9, which coming from DC is almost unheard of.   Tip: Since you pay at the counter, be sure to leave your CASH tip for your server at your table when you get up to leave.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

If you are claustrophobic do not come here or bring a group and request the group dining area that is out in the open. There are lots of seats at the bar and a few tables for 2 tops or 4 tops. We're bar people so that's where we went for a light snack and drink before dinner. We went around 6pm on a Saturday which I thought would have been more packed but it wasn't bad at all.   We were able to find a corner at the bar and ordered the chef's cheese plate special. For the amount of cheese and etc you get doesn't justify the $ amount but ..you are in 'South Tampa'.

"The good:  Free parking, plenty of room on the deck, very nice sunset.  Live music was nice.  The bad:  They are a bit pricey here . . ., Shrimp Nachos were 10 bucks for 8 nachos . . . they were decent but 10 bucks is pricey.  We added a pound of Stone Crabs for 10 bucks, we got 2 sets of legs, they were good, but I wish I went on the 24.99 unlimited Stone Crab Night on Wednesdays.  Very pricey.  The Philly CheeseSteak was decent, nothing special.  Food is typical basket bar/chain restaurant food.  The ugly:  The happy hour is not much of a deal at all.  50 cents off drinks?  What kind of happy hour is that.  A small plastic cup with drink mix (little alcohol) for $8.00, ugh. . . Also our waiter didn't have much of an opinion.  We asked his opinion of a tropical drink to try and he goes ""I am a beer guy"" . . . ok whatever, we went thru a frozen rum runner and a bahama mama and they SUCKED, especially the bahama mama, I then rolled the dice on the Florida Palm Rum Runner on the rocks, and it was GREAT and STRONG.  I informed the waiter of this and he goes ""yea it's my favorite""???? Dude, WHY DIDN""T YOU TELL ME THIS BEFORE I WENT THRU 4 DRINKS?  Thanks for nothing bro.  On a brighter note:  He made up for it by taking a nice picture of me and my girl as the sun was setting so we are cool :)  The End:  if Palms wants a better review, they have to get on par with a better Happy Hour special . . . the first 2 drinks, I could have went to Chili's and paid less for 4 of them and got more alcohol.  Atleast a $5 drink happy hour or something.  However, the view is lovely and worth a trip to the Palms if in the area.    The view/location, the attention our waiter gave us (despite his lack of opinion) and the Palm Rum Runner makes it 3 stars, though would have probably gotten a 2.5 star if it was available.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I was in town for work and wasn't really located in a good area for restaurants.  So, I checked my Yelp app and found this gem.  This isn't located in the greatest part of town.  So, I wouldn't recommend a single lady going alone at night, but then again I'm from out of town.  I ordered a pupusa with beans and cheese.  I've never had once before to tell you if this is authentic, but judging by the decor and the people serving - it is.  It is also mighty tasty. I could have seriously eaten a heck of a lot more of them.  I also ordered the Carne Asada lunch plate.  The meat had great flavor, but it was pretty tough and kinda fatty. Some people like that type of meat.  Turns out that I don't.  It came with more refried beans, some white rice, and a salad that tasted like it had 1,000 Island Dressing on it (not good).

"If you're a potential customer: this pizza tastes great! If you don't care about ingredients or GMOs, go ahead and indulge.  If you're the owner or someone affiliated with the company, please pass this review along. We could not find a website to contact them.  We discovered this pizza at Whole Foods, when Geadello's owner was on site for a tasting. My husband fell in love with the taste of the whole wheat pie, and so we began scanning the list of ingredients. When I asked the owner about the ""OIL"" in the pizza (very disappointed that it is not made any clearer for customers), he mentioned using a mix of olive oil and canola oil. CANOLA??  This pizza is supposedly made of healthy, local ingredients and yet, they choose to use Canola oil?? Not only has the erucic acid in canola oil been shown to cause heart damage in animal studies, but almost all canola crops in North America are GMO. Canola oil consumption has been linked to vitamin E deficiency and a shortened life span, and research has found some trans fats in canola oil, which were created during the heavy processing that it goes through.   According to the Weston A. Price Foundation: ""Like all modern vegetable oils, canola oil goes through the process of caustic refining, bleaching and degumming, all of which involve high temperatures or chemicals of QUESTIONABLE safety. And because canola oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which easily become rancid and foul-smelling when subjected to oxygen and high temperatures, it must be deodorized. The standard deodorization process removes a large portion of the omega-3 fatty acids by turning them into trans fatty acids... research at the University of Florida at Gainesville, found trans levels as high as 4.6% in commercial liquid oil... they are not listed on the label"".  So... back to the pizza...  While this pizza does taste delicious (although a bit ""bready"" after a few slices, according to my husband), we unfortunately won't buy it. We support local companies and farmers, and would love to stand behind you on this. But please remove the canola oil from your pizza, and properly label your products so that we know everything that goes into it.   And how about choosing all organic ingredients? We'd have no qualms about paying a little extra for a tasty pizza that actually doesn't destroy your health. Local & organic, now that's a true statement!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This business is CLOSED.  It happened just before Valentine's Day and very abruptly. New owners were not given the keys, something about a rent dispute with the landlords. The management had to scramble to alert people with Valentine dinner reservations that they were SOL.  Ah well. Here's my review of the place anyway. I sampled their goods at a couple fundraising events, and visited the restaurant once for an after-party event. All times I thought the food was decent.  The interior, as commented by others, seems like a backdrop of a David Lynch film. Dark halls, red velvet, the rooms keep going back back back. It was sort of creepy.  The price? I am aware the place was spendy and that was my main issue with the Melting Pot. Fondue is easy! It's always been lazy food to me. Too lazy to do a dinner party? Make fondue and give your guests half prepared food and make them do the rest! So, getting feedback from friends grousing that a cheese and chocolate fondue set them back $75 each is wince-worthy.   The restaurant was also vast, and in an area with little foot traffic. It also often looked closed, because the blinds were down to block the glaring sun off the west windows.   That said, the people who worked there were very friendly and helpful. I'm sorry they lost their jobs.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This is a respectable sushi restaurant, but a little pricier than I expected. Although you wouldn't know it from the outside of the building, this place has a nice atmosphere inside. I can tell they use quality ingredients, but their execution just didn't wow me. Their maki rolls are small and unless you order specialty rolls, there is nothing impressive about them. For instance, when I order a spicy salmon roll at other restaurants, it usually comes with a drizzle of that sriracha mayo that I love so much, but sadly Sushi house served theirs plain.

BFF hubby initially ordered coffee but quickly changed to tea and she brought a cup of coffee that had lipstick smears on the rims. She changed it to tea.  I requested a cup of gumbo and was brought a bowl and she insisted I ordered a bowl, which I didn't as Hubby heard me and told her it was a cup. It was corrected.

For some reason I did not care for the restaurant the first time and had mentioned that we wouldn't be back, but here we were and with a bottle of wine and having found a very rare parking space one street over we ventured on.  To a farm boy from South Jersey the parking is rare item close to where you want to be in Philly.

We were seated against the wall just opposite the open kitchen door.  Served bread and a spread with a vegetable base to go with the bread.  Anyway, before I go into the food, what makes this restaurant remarkable is the waiter (didn't catch his name) is also the greater, phone call taker and cashier.  As a matter of fact he was the only person taking care of the front of the house this Sunday and the last Sunday we were there.  He does his job very efficiently, but has little time for small talk as the restaurant fills.  There was a small number of diners when we arrive at 5:30, but as the night went on I counted a little over 40 diners in the restaurant.  The waiter also does an excellent job of multitasking up to and including making the coffee. Everything seems to move at a brisk efficient pace. The kitchen staff consisting of one cook and a helper must work with extreme efficiency for the front-of-the-house to run so well.  A few misorders on their part and there could be chaos at the tables.  The food here is very good and I think in smaller, more reasonable amounts that you would get at other restaurants.  Not a minus on my part since I came away satisfied with the amount, but did miss my take home portion.  Did not order dessert so enough said about the portion size.  Ordered an antipasto that consisted of a few olives, several meat and cheese combinations.  Also contained some very good roasted red peppers.  With the bread and vegetable dip we got earlier it was rather a good choice.  I did order the seafood over linguini.  Nice amount of seafood including shrimp, calamari rings, mussels and a few button clams.  A thin white sauce that was exceptionally tasty.  My wife ordered a pasta dish that had pieces of sausage in it.  She likes it but said she missed the richness of a red sauce and will order it with the red next time.. (her mistake) Both pastas were cooked al dente, just perfect.  OK a few negatives.  The noise from the kitchen was very unnerving.  There were sounds of plates being dropped that had us jump a couple of times,  Additionally, the restaurant got very noisy as it filled up.  There is background music but it gets drowned out by the noise level coming from the kitchen and then people raise their level of speech to compensate.  Anyway quite noisy in what should be a very cozy room.  I would definitely ask for a table away from the kitchen.  Although the smells from the kitchen were a positive.

"Came here for the happy hour after work yesterday with a few co workers. 2-6pm $3 beers. It's a great price for a pint, but their beers or food aren't my favorite in town by a long shot. However, it is close to work, which means I can make it in before Happy Hour is over.  We got the Korean and spicy wings here yesterday. Really strange that the spicy wings are so much drier than the Korean wings. They must use wings from the same supplier... but the Korean wings were significantly more tender. I think the wings were probably cooked for the same amount of time, and with the extra breading on the Korean wings, they dried out less. Btdubs, I have no idea what's Korean about the ""Korean"" wings, as the marinade was completely different from any I've tried from an actual Korean restaurant/takeout.  Fried Pickles that we ordered were pretty good though. Quantity was more than I was expecting, but I don't think I can eat that many pickles in one sitting haha. Great little plate for sharing. I'd stay away from the mustard sauce though. The aioli was way better.  The pizza we had was lacking in sauce and definitely could use more cheese/toppings.

"This place is BUSY with a capital BUSY!!  Wow!  Pulled up a few Saturdays ago to grab a sandwich, and I was shocked when I saw the drive-thru lanes.  I think there were 4, maybe 5 lanes.  It actually looked more like the US-Mexico border than a fast food restaurant.  Inside was no different; the place was packed.  Nearly every table was taken.  What seemed like 7,248 children were running amuck in the play area.  Soccer moms and baby strollers impeded nearly every walkway.  Abandoned tables were topped with crumbs, straw wrappers and unused condiments that hasty customers grabbed by the handful.  Perhaps busy isn't a strong enough adjective.  Here is what I will say though.  The staff all had smiles on their faces.  No one was stressed out, and the orders were coming out quickly.  This Chic-Fil-A ran surprisingly well despite being slammed like a porn star filing a gang bang scene.  I think maybe they just need one or two more employees to help clean up after messy customers.  Fresh customers should never have to wipe down their own tables.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"SUMMARY: Decent Greek fare in the touristy Tarpon Springs sponge docks.  - It was packed at lunchtime (10 minute wait for a table). Usually when this happens in a touristy area, I suspect that the place has been featured on some Food Network show. Lo and behold, on the paper menu, I read that Mykonos was ""discovered"" by Rachel Ray in 2007 - Gruff (mostly busy) waitresses add to the charm - We shared a Greek salad (large enough for 3 to share); it was fine, vinaigrette was light - Another table ordered a heaping meat dish (not the name on the menu, but that describes it); apparently that was an appetizer! - I had a Soutzoukakia sandwich (Greek style meatballs, covered in delicious tzatziki dressing, wrapped in a gyro)  I'd probably go again, but only after I ate my way through all the other authentic Greek joints along Dodecanese Boulevard.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I love the chihuahua sandwich and tomato basil soup. The sandwich is grilled chicken, Pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, & avocado on cheddar bread. But you can either choose from many different varieties of sandwiches or salads, too! They also have soft and delicious chocolate chip cookies. It's just slightly pricey for what it is. They seem to have more options for sandwiches than say, Panera, which is a nice change. To be honest, I haven't tried many different options here. Overall, I generally will at least stop in for soup when I'm in the area.  I do want to try a grilled muffin the next time I stop by - I'm told they're heavenly!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"While the food at Dominca was amazing, we had the worst service. We waited for over an hour for our appetizers, then another half hour for our food. Our waitress forgot to put in our appetizers. But why didn't our meals come out either? 90 minutes for a meal, especially just a pasta dish, is ridiculous. Worse, she never apologized. No ""I'm sorry I forgot to put in your appetizers."" See comped them anyway, which is good, but then still waiting another 30 minutes for food? We had a 7pm reservation, and left after 9.   That said, I'm still thinking about my squid ink pasta with crab. It was really good. So good that I'd go back for it, but would be very cautious about the service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I came to this location occasionally before they remodeled it and it looks way better now than it did prior to the remodel. It's more up to date, they have more TVs and more projectors as well.   I've only been here twice in the past few years and I'm just not a huge fan of the food. It's a great place to watch most sporting events. Stay away from this place when they have the monthly douchebag convention. Aka anytime there is some sort of a UFC event.   We started off ordering some chips w/ chili and queso and it was good but for $8, the portion needed to be a lot bigger.   I ordered a ""snack"" size order of wings for my entree. Before I go any further can someone tell me why nowhere on the menu does it tell you how many wings you actually get? I don't understand it at all and it really doesn't make much sense.   You're a sports bar/restaurant and chicken wings are your specialty and probably the most popular item on your menu. Make it easier to order and provide us with a number, not a portion. Also, offer a chicken wings and fries basket. Don't charge me close to $4 for a side of french fries.   A ""snack"" size is five chicken wings for $7 and change. A tad overpriced along with most of the menu.   I ate three of my chicken wings and unfortunately found a hair on a wing towards the bottom of the pile. The server came over and offered to bring out two new chicken wings, which I kindly declined.   The manager came over and offered me a brand new meal either to take home or to eat there. He also took the chicken wings off of the check as well as gave me a certificate for my next visit.   This is textbook on how to handle a bad situation and they handled it very professionally, which is why I will go back.   I like Buffalo Wild Wings as a place to watch sports as the restaurant itself is nice and clean with good servers, but the food is overpriced for average product.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Got a pizza here the other day based on the fantastic reviews of other people. I ordered just a plain cheese in the NY style. The owner was very friendly and I told him it was my first time there. He gave me one of the punch cards where if you purchase 12 you get one free and I like that idea. He also said he would see me back next week, as for that I can go either way.  To me this isn't what I consider traditional NY/NJ pizza. It was good and the dough had a nice texture, sauce had a good flavor and quite a bit of cheese but considering the price compared to PJ's I don't honestly think it's worth the additional cost. It's a good pie and does beat the chains but it's nothing to make me want to go out of my way for it.  They were heating up some individual slices for one table and they were way to brown for my taste, another family had a big thick crust/square pizza that looked good  but was not something that would have been my personal liking (I don't like thick crust pizza as a rule). Anyways it's good if you are in the area but nothing special.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

This used to be my favorite Pho place.  My co-workers and I came in at least once a week.  Then they switched out the chili sauce they put on the table.

"Went for a ribs special. I'd never been here before, so this was a first visit.  We arrived early just as they were reopening for dinner so there were few guests and no wait. Our server was decent, nice enough.   The special came with a 'bottomless salad', corn on a cob and rolls. The rolls were really soft and delicious. They are served with cinnamon butter, which is not my preference but a fair idea. I requested regular butter, which made them to my liking. Very good rolls.  The salad was less than impressive. I didn't even think about it, when I wasn't asked a choice of dressing, that it would come out drenched in ranch. It did come out drenched in ranch. I asked to change that, and it was no problem. Lesson learned: When getting Cody's salad, make sure to ask for an undressed salad with a preferred dressing choice on the side unless you like your salad drowning in ranch.   I ordered broccoli as a side, which was cooked perfectly. As was the corn on a cob.   The ribs were baby back, and came with a half chicken, my choice from three options. These proved very good, but again, I wouldn't consider them outstanding. Just...good.  So, for a decent, average roadhouse-type meal I'd call this Cody's ""satisfactory.""",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I was craving Korean Fried chicken and asked my husband to stop by Kimchi Guys.  I was looking forward to the crispy fresh fried chicken I enjoyed before, but was disappointed.  The first clue was he said it was ready quickly, and he didn't have to wait.  In our previous visits, we had to wait at least 15 minutes for the guys to prepare and cook the bird, and it was well worth the wait.   This time, the chicken was obviously not freshly cooked.  It was probably cooked that day, but it was not cooked to order.  It also did not have the satisfying crunch of Korean Fried Chicken. Finally, the Korean potato salad was not on the menu, so I substituted Korean fried rice, which was refrigerator cold and disappointing.    I know business has been down during the pandemic.   Even before the pandemic, I did not go as often as I wanted to because of having to pay $7 to park at Laclede's Landing.   But the food made paying to park worth it.

The house green was the standard ones that you can find in Costco.  It came with raspberry vinaigrette which can definitely use some work.  Food was alright but you can get better burgers somewhere else in town.  My friends ordered the Trio (yam fries, cactus cut and regular fries) and the Calamari.

Unfortunately, this Panera has the same underwhelming fountain beverage and tea selection as virtually every other store. I have no problem with Pepsi products, but the featured teas are pretty much flavorless except the green tea.  C'mon, Panera.

"My fiance and I live in the neighborhood and we were excited to have a ""nicer"" dining out option without having to stray far from home. On our first visit, we had the pig wings (which are excellent) and we both ordered specials. Both of our meals were very tasty. Mine was the ""turf and turf"" special, which claims to be two cuts of meat with a side, but was actually a steak with a sauce that had some bacon in it. That's a stretch for turf and turf. Regardless, the steak was cooked properly, the seasoning was fine, and the deep fried loaded baked potato that came with it was amazing. All this for $20 seemed like a real steal. There was also a cheap bottled wine special. Food wasn't perfect, but was pretty good and for the price, we were in heaven. Review would have been 4 stars for sure after that experience. Unfortunately for the review, we went back a week later. My parents were visiting and we wanted to take them out. The turf and turf special was still the same steak and bacon sauce (still, to me, not turf and turf), except it was downgraded from deep fried loaded baked potato on the side to mashed potatoes on the side...and was inexplicably $21 instead of $20. First - if you're going to always have it as your special, put it on the menu. That isn't a special. Second - you downgraded the side and upped the price $1? Get your pricing figured out! Our meal was a mixed bag. The pig wings were again extremely yummy. My fiance's fish and chips dish was good, though it wasn't amazing and it's probably not properly portioned for $17. My pork chop was fine and the accompanying bourbon apple was dynamite, but the potato pancake was undercooked and overseasoned. The clearest loser was my poor dad who ordered the meatloaf. It was SMOTHERED in BBQ sauce to the point that his entire plate tasted like nothing else. The menu didn't even mention BBQ sauce as an ingredient. It was a shame b/c bacon-wrapped meatloaf sounded really good. I wish we'd gotten to taste it. Overall, we probably wouldn't take company there again, but we'll continue to go back and, as we figure the menu out, will likely stop having such mixed experiences.

The pho was good but a bit lacking in the condiments; it was also extremely hot and I figured that this was for those who order take out. The portions are about half of the typical bowl sizes for roughly the same price as a restaurant so, yes it is economical but half the bang for the buck.

"I truly wanted to like Char, as I love all 4 Top restaurants, but I was  underwhelmed. The service was great as were the cocktails. The food however needed some help. Unfortunate because some of these things are rookie mistakes which you shouldn't see at this price point.   Mussel appetizer - very flavorful but a lot of the mussels were broken. Really should not be serving broken mussels as it means they may not be fresh. Fortunately, no stinky mussels were had but the bits of broken shell in my mouth from the broth was troubling.    I had the salmon. I've been on WW for 3 months now and asked if they could grill my salmon instead of pan sauté. They easily accommodated and it was delicious. They may need to add grilled salmon as a regular item because it was so good. Came with roasted veggies and they were good as well.   My dining partner got the prime rib which comes with a loaded baked potato. His food came out below temp - the potato was cold and we sent it back. It was returned hot but with no sour cream. We had to ask for sour cream and it was so cold - like almost out of the freezer cold - which wasn't great. The prime rib was flavorful but could have been a little warmer. He also got a side of spinach gratin. It was good, nothing spectacular, but looked like it had plain Colby/jack blend just melted on the top. It too, was not very warm. I feel like they had already plated his food and then fired mine while his sat and got cold.   Now to desserts - He got the butter cake thing which was really good - I got the pecan pie. Keep in mind, this was the first dessert I've had in 3 months so I ate it all however I wasn't impressed. This was not a southern pecan pie. It was in a shallow tart shell that didn't taste as if it was completely cooked and had a strange texture. The filling was looser than a traditional pecan pie, still good, but just not what I was expecting. There's no need to try and reinvent the pecan pie - its perfect in it's most simple state.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I'm kind of disappointed that I didn't have the same experience as the other reviewers. I had placed an order online, thinking that it would be easier. I ordered a pizza and a milkshake. When placing an order online it gives you a time estimate for when it will be ready, mine said 25 minutes, ok fair enough.  When I get to MOD there is maybe 8 other people in the place, all who had gotten their food. I think to myself ""sweet! Mine is done or near done"" WRONG. After having the 4 guys behind the counter stare at me (actually 3 guys, one was too busy with his phone) until I told them I had placed an order online, they preceded to stare at each other and told me they didn't know what I was talking about. Finally, they find my slip and precede to make the pizza. Once the pizza was ready (way longer than the 25 minutes btw) they give me the box without the milkshake. I ask for the milkshake and again I get the stare from behind the counter. Thankfully a guy who kind of had a clue came out from the back. Another couple minutes and my order was finally complete.

"Tonight we again visited this establishment.  We keep giving them a chance time and time again because we keep hearing and see them trying.  The food is good, I had the Mediterranean veggie burger ( which is what I have ever time I go here). The burger itself is good, I ask for it to be extra hot ( temperature) because being a veggie burger I know it is frozen.  This time it was warmer than last time, so I wold say it was better.  The service that is a whole different story.  First he young lady taking our order was a little overwhelmed.  Maybe she was new or the fact that is was a Thursday and there were many people there? Our order took over 20 minutes to arrive, then a basket of fries arrived, w e waited an additional 10 minutes, before we received the remaining of the order.  We were 7 people, so nothing too crazy ( at least we thought).  A member of our party ordered a beer, which was not delivered, so he had to go up and get it from the counter.  Not sure why it was not served at the time he ordered. The only reason I can ink of was the fact that the order taker may have been to young? At the end of the meal, the kids wanted shakes, we ordered 1 shake which took sometime, but no big deal.  Then 2 additional shakes were ordered, that took a LONG time.  Enough to make us go and cancel the order, we figured 10 minutes for 2 shakes that was a it too long.  As we were canceling the shakes they came out.  As we started to walk away the manager trainee ( Dave, I think that was his name) came out to the parking lot and gave us the money for the shakes and also gave us 2 orders of fries. He said "" he was the manager trainee and wanted us o be happy and return"". That was the only reason they got a 3 star rating.  I would suggest either better training for he staff or new staff.

Now for why 3 stars. The food sucks. The service is very good, but being brutally honest, this town sets the bar a bit higher and they need to raise their game.

"Okay so I have to say like many have said on here....IT IS UNCOMFORTABLY DARK!!!!! I say uncomfortable because you cant really assess the cleanliness of the place but this is a straight up mom and pop one step up from a hole in the wall so dont expect nice digs but definitely expect good food.  If you come here you have to get the stuffed portabella mushroom. It is huge and filled with lots of seafood, garlic, and cheese. We split it 3 ways and it was plenty and it was very good! It was def the highlight of the meal. I had the canelloni.  When i get canelloni Im used to having it with both meat and beschamel sauces and it being filled with a meat mixture. Their canelloni comes stuffed with meat, cheese, spinach and mushrooms and it just comes with meat sauce so I asked for some alfredo sauce as well....foul! The alfredo sauce  by itself is very good; however, I was not expecting my canelloni to be filled with a mixture of meat, spinach, mushrooms and PROVEL Im not from St Louis and never have I ever had real Italian food made with PROVEL cheese. I expect this on some of the pizzas out here but in canelloni? They could have at least used ricotta but when in Rome.....you just dont order canelloni again lol it would have actually been very good but it had a LOT of provel inside and outside so it was a tad bit overpowering. It had a very good flavor and was cooked perfectly. If you like provel cheese alot, you would love this stuff.   My bf had the chicken parm and it was pretty good. It comes with a side. I suggest getting the alfredo noodle side and eating it with it. It was very good as well. My one year old def enjoyed his alfredo pasta. My cousin had the cajun pasta and it was really good too. I want to give 4 stars but the darkness and the fact that they used provel all over and through my dish gets them a markdown for not being authentic Italian. Overall, aside from it being too darn dark in there, Id def go back there. I'd like to try some other dishes. They should consider opening the blinds on the huge front window they have and letting the light in. We forgot it was still daytime until we went back outside. Im convinced the owner is a vampire.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Arrived with no other customers in the place and took a few minutes to be acknowledged and seated. The lady behind the counter was on the phone but a few feet away was a table of three or four employees that never moved so this was not off to a great start. The waitress that finally seated us was fine but not really the friendliest. I had the quesillada sampler and certain ones were quite good with the hongo (mushrooms, jalapenos, fresh epazote leaves) being  favorite. I don't know what the non sampler size would be but I would be willing to try at some point. My gf's taco sampler was quite good but being the food snobs we are they weren't the best (Oasis in Collingswood still holds that title).

I placed a to-go order with the hostess, it was 9PM and only a few people in the restaurant.

I ordered a non alcoholic drink to go, and I told her I would like to sip on it at the bar while I waited for my order. I asked her if I could get a refill of my drink while I waited, if I needed, and her response was ""maybe"".  Pro: bartender refilled my drink multiple times and offered to put in an order of fries when I found out I ordered just a sandwich.   Con: a burger and iced tea was over $17...

You order at the counter get your drink from the drink station and get a number so the server will come to deliver the food.  Very quick service! I had the special which was the Hawaiian burger on a pretzel bun and the truffle parmesan fries.  The burger was very good and unique  flavor.  The fries was where wonderful but the truffle is a flavor to get used too.  For 2 kid burger meals and 2 adult burgers 4 drinks came to 41 dollars.

This place has some pretty decent sandwiches and burgers.  They also have authentic Chicago style hot dogs.  They usually have some different daily specials and desserts that are pretty good.

This is not meant (I think) to be authentic Mexican food. Instead, it's kinda ""food in the theme of Mexican.""

"Cha for Tea Palace channels a great dining experience with fast service and freshly made dim sum, brought to your table in a never-ending stream of carts. The restaurant is large enough to accommodate the busy weekend brunches, and is nicely decorated with the usual Asian elements found at most traditional Chinese restaurants. The service is friendly and attentive and the dim sum hot and delicious.  Cha for Tea is a little more expensive than other dim sum restaurants, such as Good Buddy or Dynasty, and generally serves dishes within the $4 to $7 range, whereas other restaurants often charge between $3 and $5.50 per item. This isn't a huge difference, although if you tend to order a lot you'll definitely start to see the effects of that price increase in your final bill.  Their dim sum, however, is fantastic. Any frequent dim sum diner can tell the difference between freshly cooked dumplings and ones that have been sitting in a hot cart for much too long. They can also tell the difference between a delicately cooked dumpling and one that has been drenched in oil. I quite liked Mirama while it was still open, simply because you could feast on dim sum for a very low price, but I was never a huge fan of their siu mai, which was often greasy and hurriedly-made (to meet the needs of hundreds of diners).  Cha for Tea's dishes, on the other hand, hit the nail on the head on all counts. Every dish we ordered was flavourful and fresh and, if you wanted more, came around again within a very reasonable time. My favourite dishes - siu mai (pork dumplings), xia jiao (shrimp bonnets), and the meat and eggplant (I don't know the Chinese name for this) - were delicious, never greasy, and perfectly cooked.  The only downfall of this restaurant is, of course, the price. For two of us, with two non-alcoholic beverages, the total came to around $50. If that's too steep for you, I'd recommend sticking to Dynasty (who, to be fair, have consistently good dim sum).  If you want to try a different dim sum restaurant and are on the hunt for fresh dumplings, delicious chicken skewers, delightfully-wrapped shrimp bonnets, and huge portions of sticky rice, then Cha for Tea Palace is the place for you.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I don't know anything about the Cronut clone they offer, but many seem in love with them and for the adventurous types they do offer other things like Thai teas, specialty drinks and even sandwiches and such. I think the real strength of this place is the family running it. When visiting you'll either see a young woman (whose toddler is often at the store), a young teenager or a short older woman running the place and they all offer prompt and attentive service. It's these people that regulars have come to know and kept them regular patrons.

"Craving burgers on a lazy gloomy Saturday afternoon and not wanting to go far from home my honey and I decided to check out Smashburger. We had not yet been and kept getting mail from them to come check them out. It is located in a plaza with a buffalo wild wings, Jeremiahs Italian icees, pizza hut, another broken egg, and Tijuana Flats amongst a few other non-food centered businesses. The restaurant is very clean. When we arrived parking was a little tricky but we eventually found some. The restaurant was not busy at all so the parking must have been from the other establishments.   When we walked up to the counter the lady was gracious, she gave us a minute to look over the big menu above her head and then promptly took our orders. We were then provided with our drink cups, a table # and we were on our way. We sat in the front of the store by the windows and placed our # on the table. Not even 10 mins later our food was out. Everything was right which was good. We both got cheeseburgers, honey got everything on his and I just got onions and the house sauce. We decided to split large fries. The cook was nice enough to split them up among our baskets.   Now on to the food. It was not bad but it also nothing special. For a 'burger joint' can you fault me for expecting more? Like I said it wasn't bad and I will likely be back if I want something close by but I would rather take a bit of a longer drive to Burger Monger.

"Came on a beautiful day for a Saturday brunch with friends. The menu seemed to have everything we were looking for in a brunch. The building is historic and beautiful. We sat outside which was nice for the most part. The traffic can be very loud, which is obviously out of their control, but it was disruptive to the lovely garden environment. They have two fireplaces which are nice esthetically, but not practical as the smoke and ash was blowing throughout the patio. Our waiter was friendly, but not overly helpful. They did leave a carafe of water on the table, but once it was empty it did take a long time to get it refilled. We ordered the bacon jam which was delicious, but did not come with enough bread, and the cinnamon rolls. For our entrees, we ordered the omelette special (spinach, mushroom and ricotta), the benedict and the croque madame. All were good, but overpriced.

After ordering, our food came rather quickly. I had the chicken pappardelle, which I enjoyed. I was a little confused why the waitress never asked if we wanted more drinks. It became clear increasingly quickly. Before we were finished eating, she was putting our food into boxes and giving us the check. We were sitting at the table talking and sipping on water. After we had been there just over an hour, she came to the table with an attitude and makes it clear we need to leave. Apparently, it was the end of her shift and she wanted to go. She was in her car and out of the parking lot before we were 10 steps out the door. By the way, this wasn't closing. It was maybe 8:15 and the restaurant was still pretty full.

I love the ginger and spice but this pho has more of a cinnamon taste to it.... not my favorite.   I appreciated the quick service and cleanliness of the place but will probably not return because we didn't enjoy the taste as much as I do in other places. We will probably try one of the many other Pho places around Harvey next time we are in that side of town.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The food is always good and reasonably priced.  If only I could say the same about the service.  Most of The waiters are arrogant and unattentive.  They are in such a hurry that you have better luck flagging a busperson down if you happen to need something besides having your food delivered.  Don't know why the attitude is so bad here - lovely atmosphere, lovely location, lovely food - such a shame as good service would make it so much better.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The chicken chilaquiles was delicious.  The tacos al pastor were a little dry, and the seasoning a bit harsh.  I didn't look, but I suspect the meat was not sliced fresh off the spit.

"SOTR is one of the best values in Indy sushi. Especially when you factor in their half-off menu on Mondays or their periodic use of GROUPON for a similar discount. The vibe is intentionally fusionistic (if that's a word), and is light on the Asian motif.

"Just walked out at 1:40pm today (Friday, Dec 20).  That's an odd hour and there were only a couple of tables of people finishing up lunch.  Unfortunately, the man in front of me placed a carryout order.  The hostess took his order, then seated me, then went to the kitchen.  In the next 10 minutes, nobody ever came out of the kitchen.  Nobody spoke to me.  In fact, nobody saw me leave.    Near as I can tell, the cook and the hostess in the kitchen were the only staff.   I like to eat in family-owned restaurants and was interested to try this one, but the risk is that nobody is actually running the place. That's what happened today.  Edited 4 hours later:  I mentioned this on the Hellas Facebook page, the owner called me within about 4 hours, and they made a strong effort to apologize and make it right. Full credit. The event really happened, but anybody who sees this should know the positive way they responded.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I got a cheeseburger for $9.25. It was HUGE and it came with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and french fries. It was pretty mediocre. My parents each got the 14 oz steak for 11.95.... A great deal! And the steaks were very very good. They came with a baked potato. My brother got a Philly cheesesteak, and he did not like it. He said the meat was dry and you could not taste the cheese.   The food was pretty mediocre. The service was pretty bad. We all got waters and they were not refilled until we were done with the food, despite some pretty obvious glass waving and slurping. (I know it sounds rude but we were parched!) The lighting in here is very dark and almost gloomy. There were only two waitresses working. When one FINALLY came over to give us more water, she only filled the glasses halfway? I think this was because the rest of the water spilled on our table. One waitress was a klutz, but at least she was dressed decently. The other was wearing a very low cut and very right top.... Not family friendly, if you know what I mean.   This is a pretty mediocre restaurant.....",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

My server attempted to explain that they are torched- the scallop was cold and raw.   We also ordered the crab Mac and cheese and it was okay- not great.

"This was my first time trying this place. When I walked into the place I was greeted with a very enthusiastic ""Welcome to Krab Kingz"" by ALL the staff. I ended up ordering the #2 Combo which included 4 snow crab clusters, shrimp (didn't count them, but it was at least 8), one sausage link, two mini corn ears, one boiled egg, and a big heap of potatoes.  The food was prepared quickly and presented nicely on the platter. I was given a bib, cutlery, gloves, and a crab cracker.  The reason for my lower rating is actually the taste and quality of the food itself. Everything was EXTREMELY salty. I ordered the original seasoning with original butter......... It was like eating a mouth full of salt.............  The least salty item was actually the sausage of all things.......  The corn was over cooked and the crab clusters were pretty small...........  In their defense, I did NOT complain. Mainly because I had eaten a great deal of my food thinking that it would get better (it didn't) and didn't want to ask for compensation or new food with half of it being gone...  Eventually the hostsess came by and asked me how my food was. I was honest, and she was horrified! She offered to completely replace my order. I refused. She explained that the seafood is cooked in water that has seasoning, then drenched in seasoned butter, then seasoning is sprinkled over top.  If I return, I will know how to ask them to prepare my food next time.

I don't like complaining about slow service because so many places are understaffed right now, but for an upscale place like this it was disappointing. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and offered good suggestions though. I got the pot stickers and the street corn which were really good, but seemed overpriced for how much food you actually got.

"3.5 stars.  We were a large group. Large enough to order BOTH the Sushi Love Boats for 2 and 4. (Love boat for 4? Plenty of jokes were made.)  I didn't have Hibachi - it's not what I prefer when it comes to Japanese restaurants in America. But it seems like Kyoto is a decent suburban nieghborhood Japanese place, with decent sushi.   I did have some luxuriously buttery nigiri at Kyoto - the salmon, and one of the white fish (I really can't tell you what it was, I have no idea) had the wonderful taste and melting texture of raw fish I love. The spicy tuna roll was alright, and there was one nigiri - it seemed tuna-ish, tho not the ahi kind - which no one at the table really enjoyed.   Someone else footed the bill for this meal, which was very nice! The sushi boat for 4 comes to $99.99, which I suppose it understandable for an A** load of sushi.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

There was no one waiting so we asked why we couldn't sit at one of the empty tables..The hostess was rude. Ignored our request and when we asked again she said the tables had to be set. The restaurant had emptied out at this point, so there was nothing stopping her from setting the table or seating us then bringing the settings. Her whole attitude was disgusting.

We were asked for the reason of visit. I mentioned it was my friends birthday. When we presented with the dessert menu we declined as we were very full. The server insisted on bringing us cookies for my friends birthday. We told him we were stuffed but he said we should celebrate the birthday. He brought 3 cookies and a small glass of milk with happy birthday written on the side of the plate. When we finally got the check there was $7 charge for the cookies. We were shocked as we never asked for anything. The server bossed us into trying them in the guise of birthday treat and then charged. For us the drinks and appetizer were the high point and the server's ( otherwise very good) behavior at the end left a bad taste for the evening. It's as if he needed the over a certain amount of billing per table.

"Am new to St. Louis and I've heard great things about Rooster, so when boyfriend visited I had to try this place out! Sooo it never occurs to me that there's more than 1 Rooster in town and all the good reviews were for the one located Downtown. But oh well, I like the atmosphere of the South Grove one better and there was only a wait of 5min at 10:30am on Sunday, whereas there were lines upon lines of people when I drove by the Downtown location.  Now onto the food. Boyfriend ordered the scramble egg platter (no.5) and I had the Slinger. We also shared a pancake. Yes, we were starving. To be honest, the food wasn't amazing at all, it's just your typical brunch fare and I don't even remember what they taste or look like 2 days later. But the service was decent and the price about right, so I don't really have anything to complain about.

"We came here for my mom's birthday dinner on a thursday night.  It was a party of 7.  It's a nice place for a group dinner.  Just make sure the group enjoys their seafood.  I thoroughly enjoyed my maryland julep cocktail.  My mom, who doesn't drink at all, enjoyed her cocktail, the dennis (made with fresh blueberries).  This place was chosen by my mom after hearing from a friend that it was great.  We ordered the smoked bluefish dip, shrimp cocktail, fried lobster, and crab balls.  The bluefish dip was out of this world amazing.  Thank goodness they gave us extra chips for it.  However, everyone really enjoyed the fried lobsters.  We had to put in several extra orders.  Several individuals had the porgy entree.  This fish had a nice flaky texture.  Even after reheating as a leftover the fish did not dry out.  I ordered the clam bake.  The lobster came out a bit tough.  I guess after having lobster at butcher and singer, nothing really compares.  The clams tasted sandy (i felt sand grinding on my teeth), the corn was overcooked, and the potatoes were bland.  Sadly my nephew did not enjoy his lobster roll (he was not a fan of the mayo).  Lastly, i cannot believe they would charge us for the chocolate pudding for my mom's bday.  I would have thought that the restaurant would've done something special for her, but i guess i was wrong.

"Not too long after a disappointing visit to An American Place, we approached Niche with pretty high expectations.  The three of us opted to order our own appetizers and entrees without taking advantage of the 3 course deal.  I started out with the roasted eggplant soup, which was nicely velvety reminiscent of the glop I scarfed down at many an Indian friends' place.  I really really wanted some bread to go with this (naan, anyone?) but alas, there was none to be had.  Even asking the waitress about it she politely mentioned that we could get the cheese plate... to get the bread o_O.  When I'm paying that much for a meal, I'd hope a small request for such a thing as a bit of bread would be easily taken cared of.  The pork cheeks, however, were a pleasant surprise.  Even though I think the foie gras used was from a can, the hong shao style braised pork cheeks with the pear gave a great flavor along with the chili pepper.  This was pretty well thought out.  The butter poached shrimp was a sort of conundrum, though.  What were we supposed to do?  Put the avocado stuff on the chip with the shrimp?  Shouldn't I have more chip and less avocado, then?  3 shrimp?  Proportions, damnit!  It was pretty darned tasty though.    After the appetizers those high expectations were definitely being met.  We had the rotisserie chicken, the scallops, and the rib eye.    The scallops were amazing.  They were ginormous.  The butter foam really worked.  The bitterness of the greens kinda worked with the sweet scallops but they were ok.  The guy who ordered the rib eye was severely disappointed.   - ""When I get rib eye I expect fat, damnit!"" It was pretty dry, almost like a filet.  I honestly don't know why the fiance orders the roasted chicken all the time.  She doesn't like white meat and doesn't like it when her chicken is too dry.  Mind you, there's a fine line between ""good"" and ""too dry"" in her mind.  Sauce won't help out either.  I forget just how much that entree was, but I think it was in the high 20's.  There are plenty of other nice restaurants with far superior roasted chicken than the one that we had for much less.  However we were discussing this dish and we came the this conclusion: - Chicken, 13 bucks. - the rest?  the freaking watermelon foam.  Great.  It didn't even make it taste any better.  I was expecting it to have some crazy dynamic but it didn't.  We were considering getting dessert but the birthday girl was too annoyed with her chicken so we left.    I thought the food was very good.  However, at this level, I'd expect far superior service and something to differentiate it from the many other bistro-esque places in St. Louis.  The ideas were interesting but the execution on the basic stuff (steak / chicken) needs some work.  So appetizers: 2 for 3. Entrees: 1 for 3.  This place was ""pretty good"" and worth the visit, if only to appreciate the other places that St. Louis has to offer just a bit more.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

This place here blows all of them out of the water. The pho tai is so flavorful, the broth is not watered down, and the meat is fresh. My only complaint is that I wish there was more meat. The shrimp spring roll is fresh and its peanut sauce is the perfect flavor and consistency. But again, I wish there was more shrimp in there. I barely tasted it. I also had the Vietnamese iced coffee and it was v good. It wasn't too milky or sweet and it wasn't bitter or watered down. The problem with it is u will get half a cup and not a full cup like u pay for (it's all ice) and if u ask to fill the cup as it should be they want to charge u more.

"I'm starting to think that perhaps I'm not as crazy about Indian food as I used to believe I was. Priyaa seriously sets my mouth on fire and not in a very good way... even the things that are supposed to be mild make me to the whole cough and take a drink of water thing every few minutes, and I just don't think it's necessary! I am usually okay with spicy food. I've been back a few times to try new things, and I haven't found anything I can enjoy long enough due to me turning into a fire-breathing dragon. That being said, I do like the flavor of the food and have had some good things.  The vegetable samosas at Priyaa are delish and a great way to start off the meal. They're pretty big and filling, though, so you only need one! They come with three sauces... a coconut peanut sauce, a tomato cream sauce, and a mint sauce. The coconut sauce is seriously bland and the mint just tastes too weird to me, so I pile on the tomato & it's a nice compliment. The spicy factor is definitely present in the samosas, but it's do-able.  The vegetable masala comes with a big pile of steamed white rice and it's pretty good, but there are so many big chunks of spices in there that every bite seems to have something new and overpowering. A few of the spices were even hard to chew through... not the best feeling to have while eating. The chicken tikki masala is fiery red and not for the faint of heart.

Service was also prompt and friendly. The barleywine and pilsner I had were tasty, and everyone seemed content with their beers. But the food was boring and bland. Fried chicken was saved by having a great batter, but the chicken itself was dry. Mac and cheese was runny and the hand cut fries were soggy. My hot brown sandwich was lukewarm with not much flavor.  I would come again to drink again easily, but the food was too disappointing to try again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I used to go at least twice a month but I think the chefs arJe getting too laxed with the details and quality put out. My last visit the rosemary potatoes were almost petrified dry.

"We arrived at our scheduled reservation time and requested the covered porch-patio.  It was a lovely spot but the fans weren't ceiling fans but wall mounted fans which just blew my hair and shirt around to the point I asked to move to another seat.  There was very loud, not relaxing for dinner, unromantic music for our dinner date.  Not what I would've chosen for my restaurant.  The servers were masked but our server wasn't personable and mumbled through his mask and seemed annoyed when I asked him to repeat his words.  He also wasn't super attentive.  We ordered the Caesar salad eyeglass broccoli rabe which had great cornbread croutons and a hint of fresh anchovies.  We followed this with mushroom arancini balls with truffle sauce.  Hubby polished off his chicken parm and I had the spaghetti with 2 meatballs, sausage with a nice full plate of spaghetti.  Lunch will be this tomorrow.

Popped in on a Tuesday for lunch with my wife while visiting the Philadelphia Flower Show. The place was a mob scene and we had to wait in line about 15 minutes to place our order. Our cheesesteaks though arrived fairly promptly after ordering but there were no places to sit inside so outside on a short wall we sat.   Their cheesesteaks are ginormous and should really be shared by two. We forgot that and ended up not needing dinner later in the day after eating the entire sandwich. There is plenty of meat in there and it is served piping hot. We opted for the cheese whiz but you can have other more traditional cheeses instead as well as mushrooms and onions.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Even if she was serving the table next to us, she never stopped at our table to see if we needed anything.   Because she never checked on us, we were there for a long time as there would be long periods of time where I wouldn't see her. At one point I even asked another server, Virginia, to refill my drink. Virginia was so friendly and when she brought my drink she asked if there was anything else we needed! That's all we expect from a good server- attentiveness.

Donuts were not fresh, they were cold and stale, as though they had been in the fridge for a while.

Their menu has everything you'd expect from a diner, like sandwiches, fried foods, fried sandwiches, etc., and there are menus for kids and seniors (their word, not mine). Our server (Nick) got us everything we needed, and took our orders without issue. He brought our food quickly too.  My entree, a pork chop, was dry as a bone. Luckily, the sides were good, can't beat applesauce! Their chicken gumbo was rather... interesting, not in a bad way.

There are a few other changes - the pickled cabbage slaw that comes with the papusas now comes in a small jar (despite our order of 6) and extra is an additional charge.

"I went there today with about 37 of my friends (yes there was literally 38 of us). One thing I like is that they had a big enough place to seat us all near each other and it is BYOB.  However, it wasn't as good as other Korean BBQ buffet I've been to. The food was good, but I've tried other places with more flavorful meat. The people there did not help us cook at all so someone in each table had to be the chef. I'm used to someone helping my friends and I cook the food, so that we don't have to waste our time in cooking but just in eating. So I felt as though it was very inconvenient that we had to cook it ourselves.   The restaurant isn't bad but there's only one bathroom for male/female and their parking lot is rather small. Our bill, including drinks, came up to over $1000. It wasn't a bad place, but I prefer to go to a different Korean BBQ buffet place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"On a Friday early afternoon, not many places in Downtown Nashville had their outdoor areas open... or none that we were able to come across anyway. Rock Bottom offered rooftop seating, so we jumped on it being it was such a gorgeous day. Pretty shortly after we sat, it seemed word had gotten out that they had outdoor seating and the place started to fill up rather quickly. The problem with that is I believe there was only 1 server for us all, so it was pretty slow. Our waiter himself was actually phenomenal though. Westley did a great job humoring a group of 7 girls looking for a good time on a bacherlorette party weekend.   Rock Bottom is a brewery, so don't forget to sample their selection! I forgot the exact name of what Westley had bought me, but it was their ""light"" beer and it was delicious. My friends were happy with their bloody mary's and they were very generous bringing us an abundance of olives and celery... because we're annoying like that.  The food was pub grub, but higher end pub grub. I wasn't expected to be blown away, but I was very pleased with my chicken avocado sandwich and jalapeno cheese dip we split as an appetizer. Everyone seemed to be pleased with their selections. I had been to a Rock Bottom in Milwaukee, which also provided us with a more than decent meal.

"When I first got my meal and tasted everything I thought it was going to be wonderful but I soon changed my mind. The squash in the soup seemed to be cooked to death as it was mush in the center but the skins were so tough they were barely chewable. How did that happen? The soup broth was quite bland and is possibly kept that way for people who don't like spicier food. I was able to fix mine with some hot sauce stirred in. The items served on the side plate, meat, rice and green salad were tasty enough (no salad dressing) but piled so high on the small plate they were served on it was impossible to cut the meat without getting rice all over the table.   The service was running hot and cold that night. The fellow that seated me and brought me chips and salsa was friendly and may have been the owner/manager but I saw him no more. The young girl who took over this service for just about the entire room seem to be working as fast as she could and was quite good at her job. However, when it came time for me to leave I waited a very long time to get my bill. And, then more time to get my receipt.  The best thing I can say about that meal was the homemade corn chips and their spicy sauce were wonderful. I ate them all which is very unusual for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Churn and burn. I typically wouldn't give 3 stars to a restaurant I frequent, but I do enjoy their outdoor seating, the fries, and usually one of 2 salads, and a server named Tamara. You'd maybe think that would be enough for a higher rating, but what one can pretty much count on when they come here is that the moment your bottom hits the chair, the server has approached you for a drink order and the push to get your table turned quickly begins. I find it's best to come here during a slower time of the day if you don't like being asked ""would you like a box?"" While you're still chewing food and only halfway through your meal. At least then when you tell your server that you haven't quite finished yet (with a mouth full of food) you won't feel as guilty for enjoying the rest of your meal in peace.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

It was primarily macaroni and tomatoes, with very little cheese, but it was good. This place is supper cheap also.

The servers all look stressed out and understaffed, and the hostess is downright rude.  The food is decent. Some dishes like the seared octopus, hummus sampler, and grilled fish are delicious.  But stay away from their pasta dishes - they always come out bland and overcooked.  Their cocktails are strange to say in the least.

We got our table, only to sit another ten minutes before our server Jeff appeared. Good thing we still had our drinks.

"The word buzzing around this new Indian was inticing so I was looking forward to giving this place a try.  The dining room is nicely appointed enough, the acoustics conducive to quiet conversation.  The server was friendly and attentive.  But the food did not, at least for me, live up to my expectations.  This is not to say the food was bad.  For many, I imagine, their dishes would be considered quite tasty.  But the flavors just didn't comport to the taste profiles I associate with Indian cuisine as I have often experienced over the years in the curry houses in London's East End or New York City's East Village.  I am, admttedly, spoiled.  We started by splitting an order of the Paneer together with some Naan.  The Paneer did offer some familiar flavors and was enjoyable.   The Naan just did not have the dual textures of what a good tandoori oven produces: a crusty bottom with a bready topside.  Theirs had a single thin   biscuit-like layer.  The apparent absence of a true tandoori oven made for a Tandoori Chicken dish that was unrecognizeable in either appearance or flavor.  The characteristic orange-red coloring was missing from the chicken indicating a non-traditional spice mix was used.  And the Chicken Tikka Marsala dish, although beautifully presented, also missed the mark in its flavor profile.  Again, both dishes had nothing wrong with them.  Many people, I'm sure, would enjoy the flavors.  But for me, they missed the mark.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Overall the experience was positive.  We had some wine with our meal and the waiter asked me the try the chardonnay.  I had to bust out my newly acquired wine-swirling nose diving wine tasting skill.  I said it was ok.  The food itself was pretty good, we split scallop sashimi and this peach soup (which had a lot of spices and kind of tasted like curry...)  Our second course consisted of shellfish roast and the bacon-wrapped pork loins.  The pork loin was great and very flavorful, but the shellfish roast was quite the letdown.  The ""shellfish roast"" was literally two shrimps over some carbs, and one of the shrimp's head was black.  Upon removal of the head, black juices oozed all over the entire entree... gross.  The dessert was probably the best part of the meal, we shared the sweet corn and a chocolate cake - both were on point.

"Three weeks ago I came in and ordered some food to go. My order was pineapple fried rice, satay, pad Thai with extra sauce and chicken Panang. I was a little disappointed in the meal.  The pad Thai was dry, the pineapple fried rice lacked flavor and I ordered it on a scale of three on the heat. I couldn't taste any heat at all. The Panang was very good and the Satay and peanut sauce was good. In all honesty, I have never had bad satay. I am not sure if it is one of those dishes you can really mess up. I went in today, because I have a vegan friend and I suggested Thai Chili, because of their extensive Vegetarian menu.  I am on my health kick again, so trying to only eat meat and vegetables and limit my high carbs. I ordered Thai beef salad. The salad came out looking beautiful, and I was excited to dig in. Way disappointed--again no heat, even when I ordered it with spice. I had to ask for the chili tray to add more heat. The dressing tasted like they just poured corn syrup on the dish. Way to sweet and it had no lettuce and hardly any tomato.  They even served it with celery.  I have eaten Thai beef salad my whole life and this is the first time I have had it with celery!  I don't even know if they grow celery in Asia!  I know many places will put their own spin on food and I appreciate the artistic culinary endeavor; however, this one was thumbs down.

The views are fantastic and I would recommend a stop at this restaurant just to see the views of the canal.  Food was decent with the exception of artichoke dip bread was quite stale.    Service was rough - the either need to trim down number of tables to match the staffing level or increase the staff numbers for wait staff and kitchen staff.  If the capacity of the kitchen only allows a certain number of customers / hour then that needs to be the limit for number of tables/seats.

"Being that it's been on the Food Network and has 4.5 stars on Yelp, I of course had to try this place out. My boyfriend and I came here on a Monday afternoon, so it wasn't as busy as we assume it'd be otherwise and I was glad. We ordered the popular roast pork with provolone cheese and broccoli rabe and got it within a minute. Judging from the sandwich itself, it was adequately juicy and tasty, although nothing to rave about. The broccoli rabe added a bitter taste and the cheese is pretty strong, if you're not quite a provolone cheese type of person, which my boyfriend isn't. Overall, I thought it was good, but not great. I said that this was like a healthier version of a Philly Cheesesteak, although we probably would've enjoyed Pat's more.

"While staying in NOLA,hopped over for lunch and it was crowded. As you enter you see the open kitchen and know how well the food is prepared. Loved it at once. We ordered pad thai and it was really good. The spring rolls were good too.  Came back for dinner and the crowd was a little less than lunch time. We ordered a lobster dish and it came out okay, but the fried eggplant was just awesome. Heard they are opening another branch nearby soon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The beer selection seemed larger, and the menu looks more interesting.  So what did we try?  Burgers!  But they were pretty good burgers.  The Wildcat had green chili and some sort of delicious sauce on it.  It was also huge, and cooked just like I ordered.  My husband had the bacon wrapped chicken burger, which wasn't quite as good.  A little flavorless actually.  Once we try a few more items on the menu, this review may be revised to a 4, but for now it's a solid 3.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"My husband and I brought my brother from Houston here for his birthday dinner. We've been here before so we decided to order something different than lobster. Boy, was I disappointed!   There's always a line so we gave them our info and was told there was a 45 minute wait. No biggie. We walked around the Riverwalk for a bit and returned 30 minutes later. I was told my name was not on the list and the hostess was freaking rude! We finally got that settled and was seated within 10 minutes.  We ordered Wicked Squid, 1 dozen charbroiled oysters and 1 dozen raw oysters. Oysters came out first and it was delicious as always. The appetizer would have been better if it was hot. Instead, it was warm.   For our main entrees; my husband had the Seared Yellowfin Tuna, I had the Drago's Mix Grilled with crabmeat and my brother had the Pasta Jambalaya. The only dish that came out hot was my brother's dish. My husband's tuna was cold. My petit filet was cooked incorrectly, my rice was dry and the dish was lukewarm at best. I was so disappointed. I love a good seafood restaurant but we will not be coming back. Only reason why I gave 3 stars was because of my waitress. She was awesome and didn't charge me for my meal.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Tried it for the first time today just because it was an ugly rainy Sunday and I was way too lazy to make the trip down to Terakawa. Although now, I wish I did. I ordered the Miso Ramen, pretty safe pick. It was just ok. I've read a bunch of great reviews but also several which have said that the Ramen was pretty mediocre & for the price. It definitely is. There are two other really good ramen spots in Philadelphia that I love (*ahem*Terakawa), that have a wayy better quality ramen for $11. Here, the Miso Ramen came out to $15. Which I'd be fine paying if the quality wasn't lacking. I feel like they added a bit of spice to the broth to mask that it had a fairly bland flavor. Noodles were ok, not much out of the ordinary. Definitely prefer them to the wavy egg noodles. Maybe next time I'll try them for their happy hour.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

There was something extra going on in this soup, it tasted like pesto. Interesting, I thought. Definitely unanticipated, but not a bad twist, just different.

"Not too much competition for bbq in Philadelphia, so this is a great addition to the Philadelphia food scene.  The atmosphere is great and is a good alternative to the UPenn food court or other restaurants on Sansom.  As far as the food goes, it is worth the lunch special prices, but be careful when ordering from the main menu - the food is overpriced when it gets above $18 an entree.  I had a sampling of a smoked link, beef brisket and pulled pork.  The meats were good and the sauces on the table were all great.  XXX and Sweet on pulled pork was my favorite combination.  For drinks, there's a different drink special every day of the week.  Be advised though, if you know what good Guinness tastes like, you will be disappointed in the pint from here.  Something didn't seem quite right about its flavor.  However, the waitress quickly offered to replace it and I had an Allagash instead which tasted great.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

We sat next to the Elephants, which was cool until about 5 minutes into our lunch when everyone came to get pics next to a fake elephant. Go to the zoo man, go to a safari. It's a FAKE elephant lol.

Burrito wasn't wrapped tight enough, nor were ingredients inside distributed properly. Made for uneven bites. Rice was mushy and under seasoned. - Taco Mexicano: we'll never know, because they didn't include them & it was too late for us to drive back. - Huevos rancheros: inedible/unappealing. Beans were bland. Rice was bland AND over cooked. Eggs were - you guessed it - bland. We could not finish. - Pancakes: nice vanilla flavor, but while 1 was cooked perfectly, the other pancake was larger, thicker and probably as a result - undercooked in the center.   Other: - sauces/salsas: green was hot, red was even hotter. However, neither had any flavor. We like heat just fine, but that doesn't mean you should sacrifice flavor for it.   Overall, was just ok. Service was friendly, place was clean. But, the food was surprisingly bland and execution inconsistent. :(",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I am at the mall M-F as I use public transportation to go to work. I decided to try Wayback Burgers. I ordered the classic which is double burger and cheese. You basically build your own so I added lettuce, tomato, American cheese, pickles, mushrooms, and added extra blue cheese spread. You are not charged extra for items which is great! I wasn't hungry enough to try deep fried mac n cheese although am curious about. I will say it was pretty darn good. The buns are awesome, wonder where they get those from? I think I would have enjoyed my burger better with mayo and mustard as the blue cheese spread is an upscale dressing. It was tasty but a little messy and not a normal crumbled blue cheese. I viewed the menu and they have a number of options... Chicken, cod and sourdough sandwiches. I will go back. I will say plan to spend 7 bucks atleast for a burger. Remember all the fixings are free that's definitely a plus. I also want to add the the customer service was exceptional, that's another reason why I will be back, plus damn I need to try those Mac n cheese bites.

Came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Sat at the bar.    We ordered beers and were never asked what size we preferred.  A little irritating considering we quickly realized we were given the larger size (22 oz) when a 16 oz was also an option.  Just makes you feel like the intent is to get as much money as possible.    Duck wraps: about enough fling for two even though it came with four wraps to fill.  Pretty tasty.  Mushroom pizza: was too much cheese... Almost nauseating.  Bacon and bleu chase burger: very tasty but messy.  Bottom line: not very impressed with this visit.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"She says: I usually love getting burritos from MexiCali.  They are large, well-seasoned, and toasted nicely.  However, one miss I've had at MexiCali was the Tofu burrito.  I was envisioning soft, marinated chunks of tofu but instead got inedible, spongy, unseasoned pieces of (rehydrated?) tofu -- I had to pick off all of those pieces and had a shadow of what a regular burrito would be.  (The cheese and the salsa, however, were tasty.)  Avoid tofu.  Veggies/meats good.  He says: I definitely like MexiCali.  My favorite burritos from them are the ones that have sweet potatoes or plantains.  While not your typical burritos, they actually mix quite well with meats like chicken.  One notable thing about MexiCali burritos is that they tend to be a bit wet.  Due to the salsa and other ingredients you may be likely to have a small puddle resulting from the far end of the burrito as you eat it.  With that said, sometimes I really want a wet burrito, and off to MexiCali I go.  Recommend: Pollo y papas, chicken.  Avoid: ""Tofu"" -- if that is indeed your real name.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Under New Ownership. The hostess is the first person that greeted us. She is pleasant and pretty...sat us at a window table. Her accent was strong, English is barely her second language. This made it very difficult to communicate the order.   The choice of music was horrible and edgy. We requested a change with the hostess whom became our waitress. She attempted to mention their other restaurant on Moana and something about a disco-tech. Who cares, we rather have peace and quiet. Then she comes takes our order & when it was ready. Perfect. Everything we ordered off the sushi menu arrived at once. It was delicious and fresh. The seaweed sheets were brighter green then the previous owner used, which by the way was Japenese.   After lunch we used the bathroom. This experienced failed miserably. Trash in stall over flowing to the floor. Floors and tile walls had to much grim. Previous owner was meticulous. The rug that is located outside both bathrooms hadn't been vacuumed in weeks. This always concerns me because what we can't see is the cleanliness of the kitchen. That remains unknown.   Did notice the glass top tables should've been cleaned with glass cleaner to avoid water streaks from a wet rag.   Before we left we inquired about the ownership. She said they are Hispanic. What? Why would hispanics buy a sushi restaurant? Oh they own three the hostess/waitress respond. Really? Wow...very interesting.   Overall the food was good.

"The food here is good, but I'm not sure if it's worth the wait or the price. Especially considering that so many great restaurants are less than 2 minutes away.  On a Tuesday night it was totally packed. There were people everywhere, you couldn't get a drink at the bar and the inside was a mob scene. It's not where you want to go on an intimate night out, that's for sure.   We ordered the buffalo shrimp because pretty much everyone said they were amazing. And they really were. I didn't expect the combo to work, but they are pretty addicting.   The cheese fondue was pretty great, but the chicken wasn't really necessary. It would make a great vegetarian option.  Besides that we got sea bass- which was crazy good and cooked well, but a very small portion and the sides weren't very good- and a strip steak- which was well cooked but had way too much butter.   Dessert was really unimaginative, don't waste your time. Overall, I'm not sure if I'd go back. I don't know if it's worth the insane crowds and the even crazier prices.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"The food is amazing and well priced for the portion sizes. I love going here for the food. I would probably stick to pickup from this restaurant. The food is great but I'm not very impressed with their wait staff. I think they were a little frazzled from having so many ingredients on back order so they weren't able to make certain dishes. Which is totally okay and understandable. Our waiter forgot one of our dishes and then brought out the wrong one right before closing time (we had gotten there at least an hour before closing). When I went to pay with a gift card, I assumed he would check the balance before charging my friend's card. I didn't realize that the card I gave him was empty. Instead of asking me for a different card, he just charged my friend the full amount and said it was too late. There was plenty of time to drop off the check before closing. It was just weird.

"I really wanted to like this place as much as I liked the other two Hawkers in Jacksonville, but I didn't. This one was not as nice either, but it has nothing to do with the ambiance as I'm okay with eating good hawker foods even by the side of the roads in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.  We ordered Pork Belly Bao, Roti Canai, Hokkein Mee, Hong Kong Wanton Noodle Soup, Char Kway Teow and Doughnuts.  The Bao was okay, except it was not even warm, and the pieces of boiled egg took away from the Pork Belly, which could have been a more generous serving.  The Roti (bread) was crispy and tasty, but the curry sauce was somewhat watery.  The wanton in the soup was thick and chewy, almost like an over boiled clump of dough. The meat inside was dry and tasteless. The broth was ordinary and bland, as were the noodles. The Hokkein Mee was the biggest disappointment, not at all resembling authentic Hokkein Mee, but even by another name it was not a decent noodle dish. It was an over generous serving of heavily smothered soya noodles, hiding tiny slivers of roast pork. Perhaps I had set my expectations too high, but it was inedible, even though I was hungry.  The Char Kway Teow was more edible, but it was nothing close to the real deal. It could have been Pad Thai or Whatever Other Noodles.  The Doughnuts were okay. The waitress we had never cracked a smile, difficult to flag down, and I suspect she'd rather be somewhere else.  The Manager, however, was gracious, and did not charge us for the Hokkein Mee, which I took two bites of. One star is for her alone.  Granted we only tried 6 items, but having eaten several times at the Hawkers in Jacksonville,  I suspect that whoever is cooking in Nashville is not familiar with how these foods should taste.  I suggest sending your cooks down to Jacksonville for training.  Like I said, I really wanted to like you, and I'm glad your happy hour brings in the crowd, but please try to improve on trying to make your hawker food just a little more authentic.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We dropped in on a Saturday night without a reservation hoping to get lucky. Who expects to get a table on a Saturday night - well, we do!  The 15 minute wait was closer to 40. They take names and numbers from walk-ins, and actually call each number in order, and then wait for those that answer to return!  Frustrating for those that wait in line, but fair (I guess). Be warned, the wait space is crowded and there are only 2 or 3 spare chairs. If only they had a bar.   The food however is definitely worth the wait. Despite the name, Tom's reminds me more of a dumpling restaurant than Dim Sum. However, everything we had was really good (other than the scallion pancake, which was just so-so). The soup dumplings were excellent.

"I've only been here twice, and it's been because someone else wanted to go.  That being said, isn't the best sushi you'll ever have, but it's good.  They have not only sushi rolls, but also fried rice, egg rolls, dumplings, fresh orange, and even fried bananas.    My first trip here I was pretty confused - I just didn't know how it ""worked"".  I realized quickly that during dinner hours, each plate has a colored ring, and each color corresponds to a price.  So, as you choose your plates from the conveyor belt, the server tallies them up and that's how they charge you.  However, at lunch, it's ""all you can eat"" for $12.95 I believe.  It's easy to overdo it for sure!   The best suggestion I can make is to come around 12-12:30, when the lunch rush hits.  This is when I've seen a good variety, and since there are a lot of people in the restaurant, items are moving quicker & thus fresher.  We came this last time around 12, and the place was packed.  As we were leaving (around 1:15), however, the restaurant had thinned out and I noticed some rolls had been on the belt for at least 15 or more minutes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

However, our three course meal which consisted of salad, stuffed mushrooms, bruschetta, Chicken Parmesan, tilapia, ziti, cheesecake and fruit was not hardly the disaster a fellow yelper and attendee suggested. I don't know what kind of grab and stash was going on at his table but you can see from my photos that we were served generous proportions.   On to the food. The appetizers were appetizing. The mushrooms were the best for me. The salad and bruschetta were standard fare. Out of the mains the chicken parm was best. Crispy, cheesy, saucy, yes! The ziti on the other hand was forgettable. But I will tell you what will stay on mind was that cheesecake! While it's true we had to share the piece we were given it was not only a generous slice but incredibly rich.

You don't know what to order and you have somebody standing behind you or a line of people standing behind you who are waiting for you to hurry the hell up and order.       I don't know what I want, I don't know if I want dessert, I don't know if I'm gonna be hungry enough for dessert.       If you want something to drink, you have to go and buy it from their market section.  It's a bit confusing.       Basically, I enjoy good customer service, I enjoy sitting down and having somebody take my order. I dislike confusing places.       I can understand having a counter with the register for those people that are shopping in their market section but in their café section, it would be nice if they had servers to help you so you're not standing in what seems to be a fast food line.

"Solid mediocre in terms of food. Their salsa tasted like watery tomatoes (no flavor or spice) and I got a chicken quesadilla and wasn't super impressed. The chicken was dry, which is strange because typically the way the shredded chicken is prepared seals in moisture. 3 stars for OK food, but really more for the cool modern touch on western interior decor- galvanized metal meets bright colors and wood. Also, their bar is HUGE and well decorated to look inviting. I'd come back for a few drinks here, but I'd skip the food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This restaurant/tavern is decorated so cute on the outside with string lights!  They had a ""bouncer"" who checked our IDs before we came in. He was definitely checking them out thoroughly. Perhaps young teenagers try to get in using fake IDs.  The bar was in a separate area in an enclosed porch looking area. It had tv's which was nice! Very modernized with brick walls. VERY crowded. The bartender attended to us multiple times and kept asking if we needed more refills which was great. I got Not Your Girlfriend's Pina Colada on the rocks which was STRONG, but good. I also got a Cosmo with Raspberry Stoli, which was also pretty good.   It was just a little loud in there for my fiance (who has lost a bit of his hearing from the military), but other than that, it was great!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"The food is good, no denying that. Upscale Mexican. It is a bit pricey for what you get, however; portions are much smaller than a traditional Mexican restaurant. You basically pay quite a bit more than a traditional Mexican restaurant for better plating/garnishes and a more upscale ambiance. Also, less options than a traditional restaurant - no al pastor, tamales, or empanadas, etc. which I would be fine with except for the fact that the menu never changes. Every time I go it's the same options. The staff is very nice and welcoming. Overall, it's decent food at a not-so-decent price in a nice atmosphere. Great for celebrations or gatherings, but not the best option for a go-to Mexican fix.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I wish the customer service was as good as the chicken. Sept 11, 2020 at 8:03pm, I'm going through the drive-thru at 2550 Grant Ave; store #11202. After completing my order, I asked for the total of my order. I didn't know that it was such a problem. I've visited this particular establishment before and there never was a problem. When I drove around to the window, I hear the employees talking loudly about how I asked for my total when I placed my order. One employee went as far as saying, how he doesn't play with these damn customers. How rude is that? I explained to the female who I gave my card to that I normally get the total when I place my order so that when I get to the drive thru window, I have money or card in my hand. After I'm given my order, I have my husband check the bag for accuracy, the employees me that everything is there and I should pull forward. She states if anything is wrong that I should then come into the store. My husband didn't thoroughly check the order because when I got home, my order was wrong.

"Went to this place because of the reviews.  Had the raw oysters accross the street at Acme and they were among the best I had.  Ordered 2 well drinks the alligator and 1/2 dozen raw oysters.  Priced at $2 each they were the most expensive so far on our trip after about 8 different places.  The blackened alligator (first time) was surprisingly good.  Had a slight cheapness but not bad and very subtle gamey taste.  It had a lot of flavor with the blackened spices.  The oyster were ok but not worth the $2, go accross the street at Acme or find during happy hour at other local places for under $1.  They charged $7 for my well which asked the bartender on the way out and he mentioned they charge $5.  Service was slow with no water refill.

Cons: our waitress was out of it.

"This place is on track to join the other pizza places near me that I won't bother with anymore. I have been going to them, more often than not, for my pizza and wings fix since they were in their old location on N. Olden Ave.. To be honest, they never were ""Wow! Their food is so good!""... but it was ok-good, and their combo specials made up for it. They used to have a plain pie, 14 wings and 2 ltr soda for approx $20 special. Most area places do 10 or 12 wings, so I was ok with at least getting volume for my money (their wings are really good, so I was glad to get a couple extra). Sometime not to long ago they reduced to wings to 10. So now their special isn't as special. About the pizza- basically, it's very bland. No tomato flavor, no cheese flavor, no salt, no garlic, no oregano, the pepperoni is blah... I end up having to ""doctor it up"". And the pie I got last night was a mess... the toppings were skimpy and were all clumped together near the middle and nothing by the edges.. it just didn't look like whoever made it took any time with it. So in short, the special is no longer special, and the pizza is so-so. I think I'm about done with Nova Trattoria... too bad, because I am a pretty loyal guy when it comes to eateries.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"The best thing this place has going for it is its location. Convenient to anything downtown, so maybe it caters to tourists. I had seen people boasting about this place online but let me sum up this review:   SUBWAY in pizza form.   Signage isn't apparent for newcomers as far as I could tell, and the staff wasn't super helpful. It also took my pizza preparer about 5 minutes to put on her gloves, with no acknowledgement.   Conveyer belt build-your-own. Nothing wrong with the setup, and I like how you can customize your toppings. I tried the pesto sauce with chicken, cheese, onions, artichokes.   The cashier was friendlier than the food-prep staff.  Food did come out nice and hot, albeit a bit spendy for what it was ($16 for the smaller size).   The dining area needed to be cleaned. Convenient that there is indoor and outdoor seating.   Everything was average and not bad. Pesto was bland. Skip this sauce I think.   Overall: average and spendy. I can get average pizza from big box chains for much less. There is much better pizza in Nashville.   The convenience factor is what will make this place succeed.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"We were in Ybor City, where we usually stop for dinner, but we wanted to try something new and discovered this restaurant on Yelp. It was a 15 to 20 minute drive away, but the reviews were so good we decided to go. It was rush hour and the traffic getting there was horrendous. The traffic was so bad that I would only go to this restaurant if you are in the area or if you are driving at a time when the traffic is lighter. The food was good, but that's it. The appetizers and the meal were acceptable, but this is not the hidden gem we thought it would be. Although we didn't try everything on the menu, I doubt that there is any spectacular Italian food here. So to sum it up, if you're in the area and want Italian food, this is a safe choice. Just don't expect to have your meal knock your socks off.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Lunch times can be crowded and there is only a single drive through which ends overflows with a few cars and blocks the parking sometimes.  If it starts to back up, try running inside because it might be faster.  Like other MCD the cleanliness tends to get worse depending on the manager or if it is right after lunch.  They do have a television and usually the bathrooms are clean.  Is remodeled so not the 'worst' like some of the older MCDs.

I'm giving it a three stars for the service but the food should get two stars.  This Asian fusion is big wanna be - pretentious with food that tries too hard to fuse too many flavors.  I had the moo shu pork which was  probably the only purely Chinese plate there was on the menu. The pork was greasy and the moo shu pancakes were Mexican tortillas. It was barely passable.  The potato fried dumplings that were really  crispy wontons with seaweed salad was over seasoned but passable.  The crispy chicken with Serrano pepper was a glorified general tsao chicken.

"Food truck Fri-YAY!  I ordered the Jr. Cheeseburger and fries.    The Good:  Incredibly friendly staff, quick service, made to order with every topping you could ever want/dream of.  Everything came out hot and I even got a cookie on the side!  That's a nice surprise for a Friday lunch.  The Okay:  Fries are sold separately and cost almost as much as a burger.  They're well seasoned with salt and pepper, but there's some other ingredient on them that I can't pinpoint? Maybe sugar? They're kind of sweet which threw me off a bit and to me seems unusual when they're not sweet potato fries.  I love that the burger is made fresh, from real 100% angus beef, but it definitely needed some more flavor/seasoning.  It was good, but not as good as I was expecting it to be.  The Bad:  The bun!!! Oh my goodness.  I couldn't even finish the entire burger (very unusual for me) because of the bun.  It fell apart with the first bite and every bite after until I just gave up.  It was crumbly.  It's almost like it was a generic, store brand bun.  So strange and I wish this wasn't the case - I so badly wanted to enjoy it!

Bonus points for the creative samurai bloody, it was delicious and super unique. Now onto food.. we both ordered the farmers platter. I got scrambled eggs, which were not seasoned at all and very bland. My friend ordered over easy eggs which ended up being very over hard. The bacon was soggy, and the house made ketchup we had to ask several times for has an extremely weird overly sweet taste/texture.

From the corner of my eye, I spotted what looked like an inviting bar emitting bright green LCD and  halogen lighting with smiling Vietnamese folks behind it. I'm thinking this place must be healthy, must be environmentally responsible, then the menu hits me. It's Pho!! (Pronounced Fu, like go Fu yourself) I find a staff willing to explain the complexities of bubble tea to an eager line of interested Americans. The spring rolls are on target, much like PhoQuyen, but I know I have to try the noodles to have a fair opinion. I do it wrong, and ask for the shrimp pho with extra noodles and the boyfriend gets the beef. I flavor mine with fresh sides provided, and it never tastes as good as his does. I consider risking boiled fingertips to remove the shrimp tails from my hot soup when I remember I am a master chopstick wielder, and that saves the day, but not the taste. The Thai Tea smoothie has a film melted on top that you can poke a giant straw through, and the straw is wide enough to allow the gelatinous bubbles to slide right up and compliment the cool tea. Ingeniously portable for a mall trip. I robotically ate everything in site, and didn't feel too disgustingly full to continue shopping. This place will be a win when I order correctly. The concise menu ensures that what they do have is done well. It's still no replacement for the diverse options of PhoQuyen, but its a great Pho fix on a chilly day, or otherwise!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Stopped her for an impromptu dinner out with my guy. I discovered it via Yelp (of course) and was impressed by their specials menu- great prices.   We sat at the bar. The bar tender was prompt and polite. The place has about 10-12 other patrons in it. Pretty quiet. We sat near two regulars who the bartender knew by name. I like that, let's you know the staff cares.   My guy order the steak medallions with a sauce. It was tasty, ok portion wise. He cleaned his plate. He is an eater so the average to dandy eater may have had left overs. I had the porterhouse steak and it was huge. I added the extra mushrooms on top. The steak had great flavor. My sides were lackluster. Old, dry, lukewarm mashed potatoes and some green beans.   The bill sort of shocked me. Though we each had a drink - he had a couple draft beers, me a Bloody Mary, the bill was over $80. For that price I expect everything to be served hot and tasty. Had we gotten the 2- for $25 steak specials instead I think we would have been much happier. Though the food was good, it wasn't worth an $80 in my humble opinion.   Probably will go back to take advantage of their bad ass steak specials next time. Check out their specials online!

"Mia Sorella is a busy place on a Saturday and probably most nights.  In fact, we could not find a place to park.  We managed to find one slot over by the CVS pharmacy.  The parking lot at this newish development is totally inadequate for the businesses at this time of day, so just beware.  In addition Mia S does not take reservations so if you arrive at 7:00pm you can expect a significant wait.  We were there with our dining partners, the D's, at 6:30 and waited about 30 minutes, not bad.  We took two bottles of wine.  Corkage is $15.  Noise level is very loud rendering conversation and communication with your server difficult at times.  Be sure she or he understands your order.  Mr and Ms D split a raw Brussels Sprouts salad with a light dressing that was slightly sweet and lightly tart.  It had sliced almonds and a hint of fresh basil.  Ms T and I split the same salad and really liked it. A bottle of Vermentino Bianco gone.  For main courses, the waitress convinced both Ms D and Ms T to have the chicken speidini special of the evening.  Mr D ordered Scampi and I had the Beef Tenderloin entree.  I was pleased with my beef.  It consisted of  two tournedos seared and topped with fresh mozzarella and mushrooms in a lemon garlic sauce.  I could not detect the ciabatta breadcrumbs or prosciutto that were advertised in the menu.  The polenta was excellent and the three small spears of asparagus were properly grilled.  This all worked very well together but.....  I could have used a bit more asparagus.  This is a frequent issue in restaurants.  Is it that valuable that I only get three small spears?  Also, the selection of mushrooms was apparently ordinary button mushrooms, overcooked so that they appeared like canned.  This dish cried out for a much more flavorful mushroom.  The dish could easily have been five star instead of 3-1/2.  The girls were not happy with their speidini special.  They ran out of the pasta that was announced, and substituted spaghetti.  There were several nice cubes of chicken breast but they were a little on the dry side and not particularly well seasoned.  The tomato cream sauce on the pasta was very sparse.  I tasted the chicken and spaghetti and liked it better than they both did.  Brining this chicken would have kept it moist and it deserved more thoughtful seasoning. This was two stars.  Mr D's scampi looked nice and apparently were OK.  For once, I had the best meal.  Usually I end up wishing I had ordered my other choice.  I would like to go back and try pasta dishes since they make their own.  They are on track to be better than three stars, but based on this visit, that is what it is.  Things are OK but a little uneven.  We agreed as a group, we would go back, but not on a dead run.  There are too many other places to try.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This bakery/deli is north on Dale Mabry but south of I-4.  It says ""International"" but does not have a clear identity. Hours of operation are not clearly marked on the door. I asked if it was Cuban, the clerk said no.  I asked if it was Latino, South American, the girl said no.  The place needs a ""story"" or signs that showcase the  ""internationalness"" of it.  The employees and most guests spoke Spanish.  They advertise a very authentic looking Cuban.  ""Don Pan"" means ""King Bread"" in Spanish.  I would love to learn more about the culture of the food served.  I decided on something called ""meat pastry"" and another pastry that looked like it had spinach.  Both were warmed in the microwave.  Both were fabulous.  Someone really knows their phyllo dough.  They melted in my mouth.  The meat pastry was something like what I enjoyed in Jamaica.  The spinach and ricotta thing was almost like Greek spanakopita (spinach pie).  I treated myself to a six layer caramel cake that was delicious and moist.  Someone also knows their cakes.  I would also consider buying an entire cake.  I would not hesitate to give what I ate 5 stars.  But no prices are posted and the people aren't terribly communicative.  I asked what soup they had.  ""Sold out"".  Apparently they fill a crock pot and first come first serve.  They have about six sandwich selections including turkey, pork, chicken, ham and Cuban.  You're served with plastic silverware and Diet Coke products.  They have a good breakfast menu.  Prices were fabulous.  Three pastries and a drink were $7.50.

We came religiously for happy hour, where the burger is amazing and the house wine is solid. We also came for brunch a few times and was consistently good - we could not believe there wasn't a wait to get in. Our last handful of events have been less than great. Service outside has been terrible, they changed happy hour from 4-6 instead of 5-7 which was a turnoff, and inside for brunch this morning we just had one of he worst experiences. We waited 30 minutes for our food, and the place was not even full. Our server never came back once to check in on us to see if we needed another drink, to apologize about the wait - nothing. Finally, after asking a different server about the wait, our food showed up. ""Over-prepped"" is what the manager said about our disgusting-tasting and burnt hash browns (they are usually SO GOOD!!) and there really was no explanation for the long wait or bad service. They took our food off the bill but that's not enough to convince me it's going to get better soon. Not until the service improves - that would have changed our entire experience. This was our neighborhood go-to, so I'm so sad to write this review. All I keep thinking is, you had a great thing going here - PLEASE don't screw it up! Please keep preparing consistently good food and please hire good servers who know how to provide a good customer experience! Also, until you change happy hour back to 5-7, we will be taking our business to Ela!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We have had many friends rave about this place and we always forget to come here so when we bought tickets to a show ahead of time for our Valentine's date night we chose this restaurant for the same night.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and has a real upscale, fun, intimate, eclectic atmosphere about it. From the lighting to the draped backdrops this place is gorgeous.  The bar area is large and had live music which could pleasantly be heard throughout the restaurant.    We made our reservations via Open Table back in November for February.  I want to stress how early we made this reservation. When we arrived we were seated right away, but at a table in the middle of the dining room.  We asked if we could have a booth.  There were plenty available since our reservation was for 5:45pm and only a couple were seated at the time. The booths here are rounded, more intimate allowing you to sit next to each other without hitting arms while you eat. They are just overall nicer than being in the middle of the open dining room. They refused our request saying there were large parties coming in and the booths seated 6.  I argued that we had this reservation since NOVEMBER and couldn't believe they wouldn't accommodate us.  They didn't care.  So we sat at the table we were given.  This being my first impression of the service for our first visit here really didn't sit well with me and made me question their willingness to satisfy their customers.  What really upset me about this situation is there were never any parties larger than 4 sat at any of the open booths the entire time we were there (our table also sat 4), there was already a booth seated with one couple when we arrived and as we left we walked by another booth seated with only 2 people. This establishment would've received a higher rating from me had this not happened and they should really have a talk with their hostess stand.  It was happy hour still so draft beers were $1 off and certain 6 oz wine pours were $6. We started with the goat cheese baklava for an appetizer.  So many different flavors going on!  We couldn't decide if it was more of an appetizer or dessert.  A great choice if you are looking for something different.  We were also given bread with a sundried tomato oil blend for dipping.  It wasn't bad, bread was a little hard, but maybe this is how it is supposed to be.  I ordered a house salad which came out shortly after the appetizer.  I really enjoyed the coconut dressing. It was light in quantity and flavor which was nice considering I don't like my salad drowning in dressing.    It took a while for our dinners to come out so we were happy we ordered the appetizer and thankful for the bread. My husband ordered the Hawaiian Delmonico which was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection.  He subbed out the veggies for the brussel sprouts which were also delicious.  I ordered the winter crab crusted flounder off the specials menu.  The fish was buttery, light and flaky and the crab it was topped with had amazing flavor. The fish could've had a little more crab on top to add flavor.  Compared to my husband's steak, this dish couldn't compare.  While the fish was not fishy tasting at all, overall it lacked flavor and the lightly breaded crust was a little greasy underneath. I ended up taking some of the breading off the bottom. I'm a huge fan of smashed cauliflower so I ordered that as my side and it did not disappoint. We almost didn't order dessert because we had tickets to a show that started within the hour.  They did say the dessert would come out quickly and it did.  We finished with the meal with the creme brulee bread pudding. This was served in a sweet sugary sauce, whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.  Worth the calories!  Would I come back?  Maybe.  I would probably come here again with friends, maybe for a special occasion due to the atmosphere.  Maybe just for dessert. However, my overall experience was taken down a notch or two due to the first interaction with the hostess stand upon arrival.  There was absolutely no reason they couldn't have accommodated us with a booth, especially after they seated other parties of 2 and 4 right in front of us and the fact that we've had that reservation since November.   This should've never happened and just goes to show first impressions are everything.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Fortune Palace failed to hit the spot.  We ordered the ""Fortune Palace Dinner"" the more expensive of the two ""Special Dinners""  It comes with steamed rice, Wor Wonton Soup, Appetizers with consisted of Egg Rolls and BBQ Pork, and a choice of entree of which we chose Crispy Shrimp and House Egg Foo Young.  The appetizers were a disappointment, mainly because of their lack of them.  When visiting a Chinese restaurant it has been my experience that when you order the grander of the all inclusive family style dinners they roll out the appetizers often with three or four different items.  We only received the obligatory Egg Rolls and a few slices of BBQ pork.  They were O.K. but nothing to write home about.  Granted the menu made us aware of what we were going to get, but it was still a disappointment.    The next course was the Wor Wonton Soup.  Usually this dish is overflowing with chicken, shrimp, vegetables, mushrooms, and of course Wonton's in a savory broth.  There was hardly any chicken in the soup, the vegetables consisted of a few slices of carrot, each of us got a shrimp which is customary and there were a few Wonton's.  However the broth was far from savory.  It didn't make it to my top ten list of favorite Wor Wonton Soups.  The soup is often what makes a Chinese Restaurant for me.  Now to the Entree's!  The House Egg Foo Young consisted of two frozen hamburger shaped patties.  It wouldn't surprise me if they patties were in fact some frozen egg patties that they simply tossed into some hot oil.  And the patties only had an egg like consistency.  There weren't any vegetable rolled into the mixture which is customary.  The sauce did have the house meats in it, shrimp, chicken, pork and vegetables, but it was merely average as well.  The Crispy Shrimp on the other hand was the star of the evening, it was battered shrimp in a spicy tangerine sauce.  I must say they were tasty.  The service was also excellent.  All the young men at the front of the house made us feel at home and welcome.  Unfortunately I felt like we were paying for the atmosphere in the restaurant as opposed to good inspired Chinese cuisine.    There are definitely better places to go in Sparks and Reno.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I hate to do this, as our server was great (sorry, I think her name was Catlin?) anyways it was Friday and I know Fridays are busy and that's cool, so i didn't mind having to wait 10 minutes when I got there with a table for 2 at 6pm. The 2 girls running the front receptionist were cute but it had to been their first job. they were looking around and around (and around) looking for tables...not moving just looking. They decided that they could split the 2 tables that were right in front of their faces into to 2 table tops AND even though i was first in line they gave the better table (the one more IN the restaurant) to the couple that came after me. ok, i forgive you. got our table and since it wasn't lunch time, i was Oh so ready for a flight of beer. The first beer was very bitter, but it was still pretty good and im and expert so i push on through. :) My friends glass though was chipped and/or melted (this is what the server though?) so they gave a new one...ok that will work.   So now comes in the dinner rush. It is now 6:30 and my friend and I are now dining with people's asses...pardon my french, but literally their butts were up against our tables...not a good thing. Then the staring started, i know everyone is hungry, so were we, but to stare us down like eat faster eat faster, not cool.  I got the Burger Republic burger + egg = my favorite. But due to the cool door and the butts at the table, not only did the egg get hard and gross, but it was gross eating with all those asses...if it were for the flight off beer that took the edge off, I was about to flip out.

"After reading all of the fantastic reviews for Tacos Cancun, we decided to skip our favorite go-to Mexican restaurant and opt for something new. We split the fish tacos and burrito al pastor (takeout in these quarantine times). The people were very nice (and wearing masks- thank you!), but I was most excited to try the food.   The tacos and burrito were both good; unfortunately, they didn't live up to the high expectations I had. The fish tacos were a bit bland and left me wanting more flavor and texture. The burrito was good- the meat was well-seasoned, and it had all of my favorites inside: rice, beans, avocado, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. I'm happy to supporta local business at this time and would get this as a quick and easy lunch.

"It has taken me quite a few months to even think about coming back here after the disaster from their first week. We came in at a really low volume time on a Sunday afternoon. We were seated and served fairly quickly. Everything went fine here but in the end, I found myself feeling more like I was at Chili's than a locally owned establishment. The food isn't bad, it's just too American (right, I get it...""Tex-Mex""). I don't even think they had any local beers which is just weird. (Maybe there was a miscommunication?)  I mean it is outside 270 and that's when you cross over into borring, big-box, chain-everything land so I this place is probably going to do just fine without me.  I will give our server kudos for this though. My kids both ordered nachos. One kid inhaled them and the other ate less than half. When he asked for a box (which was totally adorable because he's six and he just asked her without any prompting), she brought us back two containers of chips and cheese all in to-go cups because the leftovers on his plate would have been soggy. I thought that was pretty nice of her.  All in all, it seems like they've gotten their act together here as far as service goes.

"Leaving aside a ""sub"" shop locating in Hoagie land, there is a lot to like about the new Jersey Mike's sandwich shop in the Cross Keys shopping center. To begin with, the quality of the meat is very good. Many of the meats are made from organic pigs who have not been exposed to antibiotics. Second, all the meat is cut fresh for the sandwich right in front of you. Third, the quality of the oil and red wine vinegar is top-notch. Fourth, they have a spicy pepper spread if you want to bring the heat. Finally, while the bread is pedestrian the rosemary and parmesan rolls are a  unique combination.   In addition to the high-quality ingredients, the store offers convenience. The process of ordering is streamlined, and the store also offers online ordering and works with several delivery services.  The biggest downside is value. A ""regular"" sized sandwich is about six inches long and costs 9 dollars. Add a drink and chips and your total approaches 15.00. That is not a price point for everyday lunch.  The sandwich I ordered, the number 13, the original Italian was extremely flavorful. The fresh-cut cold curs, the vinegar, and toppings were very good. The Rosemary married well with all the ingredients. Excellent if not over-priced sandwich.   The second time I went I had the number 7, turkey and provolone with the same toppings, lettuce, tomato,onion, oil, vinegar, and spices on the rosemary Parmesan bread. Again the rosemary along with the vinegar really makes the sandwich pop.  The turkey breast was nice and moist. A very good sandwich if you do not want to have any pig on your sandwich.  Jersey Mike's is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and provides a quality convenient product.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Wha? So I can go to a Johnny Rockets at one location and get a 1/3lb burger, go to another and for the same price get a 1/5lb burger? This was my first visit, ever, to a JR.

"Came here for lunch and ordered two sushi rolls. This is a walk-up-and-order type of spot, where they bring the food to you after you have ordered.  There are decent number of items on the menu, which overwhelmed my party when we came here. Despite all of us looking at the menu for a while, the front cashier did not have any suggestions or let us know about popular orders which might have helped us make up our minds.  Since several of us were sitting at the same table, we found out that when they bring your food, they don't know the corresponding order number. The delivery process was disorganized, because they weren't sure which order number they had delivered versus which ones remained.  I liked that they allow you to substitute brown rice into the rolls, but what was weird is that each one of the sushi rolls came with a separate side salad (instead of 1 side salad per meal). The food itself was okay - nothing super remarkable, but I got regular (non-special) rolls so that could be my fault.   Overall the service was meh and the food was so-so, so I give it 3 stars.

We paid, I watched my friend lay out 4 20s and extra since as she said ""it was so good"" for a $60 bill, my friend went to the restroom and I went to get the car.

My friend knew she only had 4 20s in her purse and when she went to look to see if she left one in there she did not see anything expect the $10s there were remaining.  The waitress was in her face and my friend felt uncomfortable so she gave her $20 more and left.  I was not there to assure her that she had indeed given her the appropriate amount and now as I read previous reviews I see that maybe we can't so much trust this restaurant when it comes to money.

"Two visits to this particular OG over the last few months, one was dine-in and the other was take-out.  In both instances, the service was above average and the food met expectations.  Unless you're new to our planet, you know what this major chain is all about and this new location is clean, spacious and serves properly cooked menu items.  Besides, their current Buy One, Take One home entree deal can actually be ordered online for take-out purposes and features quite a bit of food at a very low price. (This promotion even offers a free Redbox movie rental if you want that too)  While I will never make any Olive Garden my first, second or third choice for a planned meal, there are times when I want something familiar and fast. This location will be on my list again for that purpose.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I really wanted to love Zorba's! My partner has been talking about this place for a long time and it gets such high ratings on Yelp. We have 2 Greek places within a 5 minute walk of our apartment in Midtown and considering those two places, Zoe's Kitchen (essentially a Panera for Greek food), and Zorba's, I would put Zorba's at the bottom of the list of Greek places I have eaten at. I'm sorry?  We called earlier in the day to make a reservation for 2 for 7:30pm on a Saturday because we wanted to head over to Jack's Pumpkin Glow after at 9pm. When we called, they asked if 7:45pm was okay. We went with it, however, upon entering the restaurant (albeit a little late), there were plenty of tables open. Maybe it was all just cleaned off, I don't know. The table was super wobbly, but the waitress helped us get a folded napkin to balance it out and then opened our wine for us when we were sure the surface wouldn't capsize our glasses.  Not wanting to overdo it and end up with leftovers we'd have to bring through the pumpkin patch with us, we started with tzatziki and ordered an entree each - mixed charcoal grill for one for my partner and meatballs for me.  The bread that arrived first was delicious - warm and fluffy - but the olive oil/vinegar dip had too much vinegar. The tzatziki had a weird zing/kick to it that I wasn't a fan of. I couldn't place the spice. My partner liked the meats of the mixed grill but not the sides. I liked the meatballs and the sauce, but also, not the sides. We each got the roasted potatoes, vegetables, and rice - which it seems every dish comes with. The potatoes were complete mush and had a vinegar taste to them that I did not enjoy. The vegetables were also complete mush. The rice was good.  So the meats and bread were yummy, but everything else... Not so much. Overall, really disappointed and not worth making the trip to Fairmount for it. I'll stick to our local spots in Midtown/Washington Square West.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Tonight, May 2 2017, Sportsman Grille was not on their A game. My food was delicious as always. For a chicken sandwich, side salad and baked potato, my dinner cost $17:50 plus 20%tip. Our waitress was super nice but she was the only one working while the others stood around the cash register. The incorrect chicken sandwich was brought out meanwhile my friend ate her food while it was hot. She had to order fries because the SG ran out of veggie skewers and broccoli. Bottom line, SG is getting a run for the money with the new players in town and if they don't get a better staff and mindset, I don't know how much longer they can stay in business. I paid quite a bit of money for my delicious dinner to sit in a stinky restaurant with a less than enthusiastic staff. Bad management at best. Sorry.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"When I came to visit my nephew, he was giving me options for breakfast. He listed the mainstream restaurants that I could go to back home, but when he said Tim Horton's, I perked up. My daughter thought it was only found in Canada.  When we arrived, I was excited. I was hoping it didn't just have baked goods, but also hot food. I searched for the menu for a combo. I found the Farmer's Wrap, but it didn't look that great in the picture. I ordered a Caramel Latte for an up-charge with it. The wrap was surprisingly decent. The hash brown had the normal yummy greasy and salty flavor. The Caramel Latte was actually a Mocha Latte, so I asked them to correct it. It was too sweet, but I wasn't in the mood to change it again.  The Nutella-filled cookie that I ordered was not the one I expected. The display was chocolate-looking, but we got a white cookie. I'm not sure what the chocolate one was, but they said the Nutella-filled SHORTBREAD cookie is what we had/ordered.  Although the food was just good, I will probably return just to give it another try.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This was our first time here. We were really looking forward to going here because the reviews made it soud like a fantastic place to go to, but after sitting down to dine I would say that's not completely true.   This place is over-priced for what you get.  The portions are small. Service was great, but the food was ok. I've had better Thai food than that. It seems that some of the dishes are prepared in advance and refrigerated, only to be nuked and served when ordered. The flavors are not authentic. We found all the dishes extremely salty.  As appetizer, we ordered chicken lettuce wraps but the meat was so overly salty that we had to send it back. The hostess was nice enough to let us order something else.  So we ordered the summer rolls. You cant go wrong with summer rolls, right? Wrong. For $7, you get four bite size rolls. The outer rice  paper covering was hard and dry as if the rolls were made in advance and refrigerated. They did not feel or taste fresh.  We proceeded to order our main course.  I got the drunken noodles and my husband ordered lemongrass chicken. The drunken noodles tasted good but did not have enough of the Thai basil like it's supposed to. I did not care for the lemongrass chicken, it was also very salty, and greasy and did not taste the lemongrass. I know my Thai food very well and this was just not what I expected it to be.  When we asked the hostess why their food was so high in sodium, she said that they always overly flavor their dishes because that's what their customers love! Maybe it's just me, but I would not call an overly salted dish highly 'flavored!'.  The true flavors come from the ingredients not the salt.   We decided to skip dessert and left. I'm sorry but we will not be going back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The staff-- for our first time there, although it said seat yourself, we sat for at least 10 mins before we got back up and went back inside to the bar and asked do we have a waiter.

Finally decided to try the local cheese cake factory after going to the one in downtown San Francisco numerous times. Let's just say very disappointing. Food was average and service was beyond bad. First we get seated and didn't get our drinks taken for 10 minutes. I could understand if it was busy but we were her only table. Took nearly 20 minutes to get my drink but for some reason they brought out my guests drink and kinda ran away before I could ask about mine. Next our waitress didn't even ask if we were ready to order and the manager had to take down our order. Food came out relatively quick... But my sweet potato fries were kinda cold and soggy which tells me the food may have been ready but forgotten about. Burger was amazing though great quality. We had the cookie dough cheese cake which I did not like. Way to rich. Still like the apple the best. Anyways based on the terrible service I can't give it more then 3 stars. If food wasn't good would def be a 2*. May give it another chance who knows.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
I got an order of jumbo wings with the Flamies hot flavor and they were good. The 3 stars is not for the food. The cashier was rude. He was rude to people calling. He was rude to people in the dining room. He was just rude. Another reason is that sauce is extra. Not that extra sauce will cost you but your initial sauce will cost you. Who sales hot wings with no blue cheese or ranch and not even make it in house? The final reason is the ceiling has major water damage with active wet spots and leaks throughout the restaurant. I'd hate to go in and have a rain storm hit. You'll be covered in gross ceiling water. Yuck. Fix the attitude and fix the ceiling.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I haven't ordered pizza in awhile from Papa John's.  I usually order from mom and pop stores or other restaurants trying to spice it up, but my kids wanted PJ's last night and so I called my order in at 515-520.  We ordered a large pepperoni pizza & was told it would be ready for pickup in 20 mins.    I arrived around 535pm and was told there would be an 8 min wait.  545pm--still no pizza but a store full of people.  Sure!  I'll give them the benefit of doubt and say that maybe because it was Friday that's why it took so long but still I assumed there would be some coupons or an apology given for the longer wait.  At any rate I received my ""20 minute pizza"" at 602pm and vowed I'd go back to trying other places or making my own with the kiddos especially on a Friday!

"Sorry lovers, another dissenter here.  I too have eaten at Dinosaur BBQ and lots of other rib joints so maybe that's the reason.  Or that I like a wet rib on the lean side of things and a more flavorful rub.  Not sure.  The wife and I ordered a whole mess of stuff.  She loved the ribs, some of which were bunt but I digress.  My biggest beef, pardon the pun, was the fattiness of the ribs - yes, they were huge ribs - but they were so fatty it kind of grossed me out, and the lack of flavors in the rub - kind of indiscriminate heat but little complexity of flavor.   The regular sauce was nothing special.  I guess I should have tried the spicy.  The sweet potatoes were awesome - I ate almost the whole thing myself.  The corn bread was dry as a bone and the mac and cheese  was just ok.  We took home half a rack of ribs, corn bread and mac and cheese - the portions I didn't eat.   Would love to say I loved everything I ordered  and would be back as Jimmy's a really nice guy and very accomodating, but unless the flavors change, I probably won't be back.  Update! I recently had Jimmy's ribs at a school fair and they were *awesome*.  Like I went back and got more awesome.  Jimmy wasn't the pitmaster so I'm not sure if that was the reason or I went the first time on a bad day or what.  So I'm bumping Jimmy's up to 3 stars for the much improved ribs but I bet the sides are still not do good unless the new guy fixed that too.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Walking into this place it seems dated. There's not a lot of light.  There's no fresh pho smell that you would expect from a Pho restaurant.  But we gave it a shot since our usual place is closed.  We sat ourselves.  The server was nice and brought our menus.  We sat and pondered what to eat.  I finally settled on the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup and my hubby got the Shaken Beef rice plate.  I also ordered a strawberry smoothie with tapioca pearls.    The rice plate was huge but portion size was small.  One cup of rice with maybe a cup of diced beef.  Some veggies and sauce.  It was tasty but for the price, you would expect a bit more meat.    I had the spicy beef noddles.  It had pork blood in it! Which was awesome! The bowl had good amounts of noodles and beef.  What I didn't like was the massive amounts of shaved lemongrass in my soup.  Each bite, I had shaved lemongrass to accompany my delicious soup.    At the end of my meal, my drink still did not come.  As we were paying, they decided to charge me for the drink and make it at the counter near the register.  I said I don't want it now that we are done with our meal.  They were hesitant but eventually took it off our bill.    I probably won't come back if I can help it.

"This place is just ok for me.  I can't see myself going back, although it is a out of my way.  I had the little wang fried rice with chicken.  My dish was pretty good.  It was missing a little something though, but after I added some soy sauce I was good to go.  My husband had their take on general tso's, I forget what it was called.  That was not nearly as good as my fried rice.  It was lacking some flavor, and the chicken was not breaded like it traditional is w/ general tso's.  Also on the down side is their tea.  They do not have regular iced tea, they have a black currant or passion fruit tea, that's just not my thing.  The decor on the other had was really nice.  Much nicer than I expected.  I will also note it was a little warm in there.  Overall, it was an ok meal and was pretty cheap.  It didn't really impress me though.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Stopped for a meal at another restaurant literally across the street, but they were swamped on a Sunday evening and the wait was over an hour. We decided to give this place a try. At first, they looked like they could be open or closed. Not sure which, and different online sites conflicted as well. There weren't many cars in the lot and not much light was visible from outside. To be honest, we suspected the parked cars were from patrons across the street. Also, there were coverings all on the outdoor furniture.  That gave us the impression they might really be closed during COVID.  So, in we went to see for ourselves. They were, in fact, open and there was absolutely no wait!  It's a good thing too for we were famished. The place looked nice outside (albeit at night) and inside too. The service was just fine. Prices were on par for the area and cuisine, maaaaybe just a little higher. Now let's talk about food details.  The food looked pretty nice, but the actual taste was...well, I'll give you details. The red salsas offered with the chips had a strong tomato sauce taste to them.  I had the Carne asada chimichanga (Not combo). The amount of guacamole and sour cream on the plate was tiny. The guacamole had large chunks of tomato and maybe other stuff too, and lacked avocado flavor, for my liking.  The steak inside was cut up into very small pieces, cooked quit Well done, and it seemed a small ratio of meat to tortilla, in my opinion. On a plus side, the meat was not tough to chew due to its small size and had absolutely no gristle or fat in it.  The tortilla was quite nice and fresh tasting.  The pico de gallo served on the side was okay as well.  My husband had the Carne asada burrito combo platter. He felt his meat portion was appropriate. It did not come with guacamole or sour cream, just rice and beans, which he said were ""average"".    Overall, we feel the food, while definitely good enough to eat, but comparatively, just average.  On the flip side of that statement, I would never be afraid to go there again.  I would definitely be willing to give it 1-2 more tries to improve my opinion.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Xfinity Live is one of my happy places. As an avid Philly sports fan I welcomed the opening of this huge venue that is home to 4 different bar/ restaurants and offers a large communal space that hosts ridiculously huge TVs to watch any game your heart desires on.  My favorite place in Xfinity is PBR by a longshot. They play country music, have a mechanical bull and Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat is constantly on tap. What more can a girl ask for?  Oh yeah... a seat. This place is absolutely awful during Eagles games. I've gone a few times while the Birds were playing in, and away, from home and have struggled to find a space inside of the huge arena. The one time I made sure to get there super early before any games began I was told that all the tables were reserved and if I wanted to reserve two seats (one in front of a pole to the side), I could do so for $40 per seat. Come on, Xfinity! Cut a fan a break here.  I've also gotten pretty sick every time I've eaten at Xfinity. I've only ordered from the main bar in the center of the facility and from PBR but each time I left with a bad case of food poisoning. I don't know if both times were flukes or not but I refuse to possibly put myself in an uncomfortable situation by ordering from the other bar/restaurants inside of Xfinity.  The back of the venue has a large stage and I've heard some good, and some bad, performances before and after sports games. It also seems to be a pretty happening place for Philly nightlife. I remember seeing girls in club dresses arrive right after the Phillies game ended during the Summer.   All in all, this isn't a bad spot at all. I've even been offered free happy hours at Broad Street Bullies and PBR... still not quite sure how that happened, but it did! I'd definitely recommend for watching sports games, outside of the Philadelphia Eagles.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This place is now called Vudu Cafe and Lounge. I dined here on a Saturday night with 5 friends. We were seated promptly as we had a reservation prior to the dinner rush. Kevin was our server and he was very knowledgeable and offered great suggestions. The menu offers several enticing dishes, and it was hard for us to decide. A good problem to have.   We did drinks, appetizers and entrees. They provide you with bread and some cajuny butter that is quite delightful. The appetizers our group had were the stuffed mushroom (crab cake on top of a grilled portobello - yumz), fiery shrimp (sneaky hotness, loved by all), and blackened scallops. Three of us had the shrimp and crawfish etouffee in a peanut roux with the holy trinity. Another had blackened shrimp, scallops and rice, and another entree was the alligator sausage and boar with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The food was really good. The  mashed potatoes were the only thing that struck me as better than good. I wasn't wow-ed by anything in particular, but it was good. And even though I had the Panty Dropper cocktail (sorry, Mom),  I keep describing the food as 'good.'   Good? Good.   I do believe they are a bit overpriced, and the decor reminds me of high school prom. The tables are what my friend described as 'tailgating tables' covered by purple table clothes. I can get over the decor,  and enjoy the good food, but what really bothered our group was the vulture-esque attention from the staff when it came to clearing plates and urging us to 'box' our food (not our server, Kevin). They were all too eager to move us on out the door. I cannot count the times we had to explain that we were still working on our appetizers and entrees - good food, good drink, and great company are not to be rushed.

"I truly wanted to love this place because the ambiance is an A+, the food however could use a little work. We started off with the calamari, which was pretty good, it was a light breading and had peppers fried with it. It came with a Caribbean dipping sauce that was not mayo based so I'm sure that's why a few people have complained about that particular dish. I didn't mind it, and thought it was fairly tasty.   My husband had the lobster bisque which had good flavor, but was a little on the thin side and could use a thickening agent to get that nice velvety texture you want in a bisque. He also had the Caribbean oysters because they didn't sell a half dozen raw, and those were terrible. He only ate 2 out of 6 because they were smothered in the same sauce that came with the calamari, and had a light dusting of cheese. The Caribbean sauce was just too overpowering for oysters. Definitely hope they change the menu to offer a half dozen raw oysters and just take those off all together.   I had the jerk burger, which was again, way overkill on the Caribbean sauce/seasoning. My burger was smothered in what I would call a Caribbean barbecue sauce and caramelized onions, which if I had been about a quarter of the amount would have been okay. The fries were again..okay, but not quite as crispy as I would have liked for such a thick cut French fry.   The menu is a bit limited, with not many items that seemed like you weren't taking a huge risk on liking it since the prices were moderate for the type of restaurant. Hopefully they will read some reviews and take some things into consideration, and it will become a bit better.

"I've been to new york dozens of times and in fact, I was in the city just last week.  Sadly, this pizza does not even compare to a good new york slice.  That being said, yes this is Reno, and thin crust options are limited, which is why I will give this place 3 stars.    Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was a bit let down by Grimaldi's.  The crust is thin, and overall the pizza was tasty, but I wouldn't call it anything more special than several other good pizza places in town.  It was missing some flavor, in my opinion.  I was also sadly disappointed by the pepperoni and muchroom toppings - was hoping for something a little fresher and not packaged, as they appeared to be.   The antipasto was very good and for the price, was a generous portion.  $50 later, I had an okay pizza and a nice salad.  I won't be rushing back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The food is fine, But, for ""tapas"" they are priced like full meals, though their size is miniscule. Paid $19 for a roasted beet.... and folks are expected to get 2+ dishes each?

Of everywhere we ate in Philly, this was the most expensive and the least notable.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This is a contender for the best Italian on the south side.   It's also one of the few non-chain Italian restaurants on the south side.   Do you see where I'm going with this?  The food definitely had a homemade, that's-how-Mama-use-to-make-it flavor.   They have gnocchi which is something I always look for.  Service wasn't great.   They were a little busy and only had 2 waiters working for so wait times for drinks/refills/ordering were long.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Purportedly the owner is from New York and brought the pizza style here with him. This may be true, but if so, I assert that he left New York because nobody there made crust thick enough for him. It's New York *style*, but if you're dreaming of a taste of home, this isn't it.  Authenticity points for making me wait ten minutes for my garlic knots even though my pie was ready.

"What I like:   Nice second floor of airport terminal at historic general aviation airport.  Watching planes takeoff and land right out the window is fantastic.  Food is usually good.  What I don't like:  Menu is somewhat ""tired"" - it just doesn't get updated much and after a couple of visits you feel that there is not much else to have.  Stay away from Quesadillas.  They are a stomachache.  Their chopped salad is iceberg, peas and chopped tomatoes.  Not like the definition of what I've seen around the area with that description.  Service at bar is slow.  Recommended for:  Those flying in from other places without a car, USF St. Petersburg employees and visitors, Port users and marine science industries who want a nicer lunch or dinner with little walking or no driving.

"Nora's has been on my list of ""must try's"" for quite a while. Well, sadly, I was underwhelmed. Having never been here before I was expecting more than what was offered.   Walking in around 1:30 on a weekday there was only one gentleman sitting in the window seat. There were crumbs all over the tables and the place looked a bit in disarray. The cashier was trying hard not to make eye contact with us and honestly I was feeling kind of creepy.   After studying the wall menu (which was cute) we walked up to the man hiding behind the register and ordered. He asked what kind of bread I wanted and we paid and that was that.  Our food arrived and was surprised that what I had ordered ""The Dip"" was so dry. The BF had soup, beer and cheese, i think, and said it was wonderful.

"Come for the okra, stay for the okra. Hard to find on menus outside of Texas, Baby Blues does right by their okra. The breading was *chefs kisses!* delish. The sauces are also banging, and sauce is about 50% of a good BBQ experience, in my humble Southern opinion.   The perks of this place are proximity to my workplace, a decent happy hour, affordable lunch specials, and outdoor seating. The problem I'm noticing as I write this review from a visit a week ago, is that the meat was not particularly memorable. I honestly couldn't even tell you what I ordered besides the okra. I remember our outdoor table was extremely unstable, and I remember the service being super spotty. (Though extremely nice!)  BBQ is best left to the cattle ranchers, but Baby Blues is a decent enough option to keep my cravings at bay between visits home.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"We hadn't been here for a few years and though the owners haven't changed, the menu definitely has. They no longer offer yakitori, chicken bits on a stick, as an appetizer.   One thing that continues to annoy me about this place is the wait persons disregard for our requested appetizers. We specifically asked for three dishes as our appetizers but they showed up at our table willy nilly. We got one person's appetizer, then the sashimi rolls and finally the other two appetizers. I feel this is the servers fault. But it is also management's fault for not training the service staff properly.   We were not offered hot towels to clean our hands at the beginning of the meal. I don't know if this is due to a change in policy or negligence of the server.   At any rate, the gyoza got top marks, the octopus balls were okay and a bit of a creepy novelty - see video. The chicken replacement dish was okay, but a bit more meat than I really wanted.    The big disappointment of the evening were the California rolls. They were bigger than we usually get and had grapefruit pieces in the centre?!! Weird and hard to manage with chopsticks. The smoked salmon and avocado rolls were perfect and the avocado mushroom rolls were good. The green tea is one of my favourites here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"After about a 20 minute wait on a Sunday around noon, we were shuttled to a table and greeted by our server with much needed coffees and waters. After indulging the day before, I decided to go with the lox platter (one of the few lighter choices on the breakfast menu).  Then out party waited for the food to arrive. And waited, and waited....for about an hour. It took forever. Our server was very apologetic and kept our coffees and waters topped up until the food came.  My lox platter was average. Grocery store quality bagel served with a single-serve Philadelphia cream cheese tub, under-ripe tomatoes (and it's summer), white onion (I much prefer red onion with lox), capers, and lox. At least there was a good portion of the fish. My request to swap the hardboiled egg with fruit resulted in a cantaloupe slice, which seemed to come standard on all of the breakfast platters. I didn't inquire further...I was just happy to have food in my stomach after the long wait.  Despite the wait and my mediocre meal, our waitress was outstanding. Five stars for her service. I would return, but likely not during the weekend rush. I would skip the lox platter and try one of their egg or griddle dishes instead.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I've heard about The Turning Point being a great addition to the area so decided to try. The wait time wasn't bad because we signed up on the waitlist on Yelp before we arrived (if you don't do this ahead of time you're looking at a 40-50 minute wait time). After ordering our food we waited a really long time for it to arrive (about 25-30 minutes). I didn't expect the wait for breakfast food to take so long. The kid's dishes came out well before ours and they finished before we even started eating. This resulted in the adults not being able to enjoy anything.  We ordered the following: Kid meals- Fruit Loops, chicken fingers and apple slices and French toast. All three were a hit, no complaints.   Seaside Jersey club- big sandwich, but you can tell it sat for a while because the bread was rock hard. My dad didn't really enjoy it because of this.   Grand French Toast- my husband enjoyed this very much however; $15 for just a plate of French toast with no sides is rather ridiculous.   Key West Omelette: Just okay. It did have a lot of shrimp. But the ratio of bacon, tomatoes, shrimp, avocado and cilantro to eggs was ridiculous. It didn't seem like an omelette because the other ingredients were just too much. The amount of cheese alone was enough to destroy the omelette.   Iced coffee with caramel flavor and almond milk- couldn't drink it because the coffee tasted very old.    Overall, The Staff was very pleasant and attentive. The decor and seating is beautiful. I'm on the fence about giving this place another try. I'll update my review if we do.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Impressed with the portion size particularly of the generous number of  jumbo shrimp in the fajita. Really don't think the margaritas are good. We sent back the Cadillac and tried the hibiscus jalapeño and weren't impressed with that either. The willow rice and retried beans and guacamole that come with the fajita are very good though.

Ate here today. First time at this chain. Didn't like that ketchup and napkins were brought out on a tray to limit consumption. The grilled chicken sandwich was bland.

"We were here for a paint nite event so my review is pretty limited to just the food/drink and not so much the service/atmosphere.   The restaurant is a lot larger than it appears from outside and I do like the decor. It can get really loud in the bar area even when not at full capacity.   My bf and I each ordered a drink, I can't speak for his but mine was really strong but pretty boring so I was not eager to have another for $10.   We weren't super hungry but shared the chicken quesadilla. The menu was not my favorite so it wasn't the easiest to find something we'd both like.   The quesadilla wasn't anything special and was tiny for the price.

You can always get a place to sit, free Wi-fi, and yummy goodies.  The not so positives: I also had their Yerba Matte, but I have to say it was pretty weak and not as flavorful as the Yerba I've had at other locally owned shops.  The Bathroom is not so nice. Its clean, but it has a real sketchy feel to it.

This is a good place to get those stick-to-your-ribs kind of meals. I went there for breakfast today and I would have given it four stars except for two problems.

Upon entering, the two women at the bar looked up at us and that was the only acknowledgment we got. The younger one seemed pretty intent on her cell phone. I get that she was bored. The place was pretty dead but you'd think when people come in, you could greet and bring menus. Just when I was about to leave, the older of the two ladies brought my menu and explained I'd have to order at the side bar. We opted to try the Baja sticks and a half order of Layered nachos. Neither were anything to write home about. Nobody ever checked on us either. On a final note, it's disconcerting to not get an itemized check and watch someone add up the food & beverage amounts on their cell phone. Do they not have a pos system??

It was a great place to watch a Sixers game with TVs all over the bar and you never had to look too far to see what was going on.  Misconduct Tavern offers a large beer list, and collaborates with local breweries on occasion for their own beers at their location. The food menu is also pretty impressive, they offer at least a dozen style of burgers which all sound very interesting. This night a I had an Italian wedding soup burger, which was a ground pork and white bean burger with escarole and provolone. The burger was incredibly unique and had lots of flavor.

"My husband and I were married at the Gables at the end of July.  We elected to get married outside without a tent, despite the scorching heat.  Everything turned out absolutely beautiful, and was seamless from start to finish.  Kelly was awesome throughout the entire planning stage, and really worked with us to ensure that we had the things we desired, while staying within budget.  The night before the wedding we were able to drop everything off at the Gables - something that didn't happen until 11pm and yet the whole team was accommodating and did not mind that we were there so late.  Tommy, Alex, and Sam were instrumental in making sure that everything was executed flawlessly on the day of the wedding.  They had everything set up as I envisioned, and required very little guidance in the matter.  My mom stopped by the morning of, and everything was basically done with nothing left to do.  We elected to go with mini cheesecake desserts, rather than a traditional cake, and they set up a dessert table more beautifully than I ever would have imagined.  The appetizers and entrees were fantastic, and our guests are still raving about the food to this day.  The price for everything, particularly food, is much lower than most in the Philadelphia area, and yet you don't compromise one bit.  They even have a closet full of things available to decorate with, such as mason jars and various signs, which helped us cut costs without ending up with a bunch of decorations that we would not need after the wedding.

"Excruciatingly slow service. Mediocre food. Ugly decor.  During the one hour wait between being seated and actually getting our food, my friends and I tried to figure out how this place stays in business. We decided it's because this is the compromise restaurant when you're eating out with other people. The menu is so large that no one can veto the place because they serve a bit of everything.  I only eat here every year or two, which is evidently how long it takes me to forget how much I hate it. I'm not sure why there's always a line to be seated considering how mediocre everything is. The decor is really ugly too, so there's not even anything interesting to look at while you wait.  They were running out of bread when we arrived, which is why we didn't get any pumpernickel, just the tough unappetizing baguettes. And when I needed a refill, the waitress disappeared with my glass for five minutes instead of bringing me a new one, so they were probably running out of dishes too.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I took off two stars... I'll tell you why at the end of this review. It's not because this is one of the most poorly staffed Taco Bell's in the city. We've covered that in other reviews. But just to recap; if you go to this Taco Bell during regular human food eating hours (breakfast, lunch, dinner), prepare to wait a long time, especially in the evening. You better REALLY need yourself some Taco time. Not to be confused with Taco Time. Go to Taco Time if you need that kind of Taco Time, go to Taco Bell if you need Taco time... that was overly confusing but I can't ever go back. These reviews only go one direction for me... insane.  It's important you look at the photo of me eating the new Nachos box in a bathtub. That's the appropriate way to eat Taco Bell. No, it doesn't have to be a bathtub. But you really want to let the sadness sink in when you're eating at Taco Bell. Telling yourself that ""it's just a fun little guilty pleasure meal"" is a lie and will only make the pain greater, you're at Taco Bell because you've given up hope about something: It could be your love life, paying your bills, or your long standing ambition that you tell everyone you have so you can hear it out loud and get a free tiny endorphin rush. Whatever it is, be honest with yourself fully and eat said Taco Bell in a context that supports the overall motif - desperate sadness.  On the toilet is also a great place. And if you're lucky enough to have someone knock and check on you, say nothing, and pray they call 911.  For the ultimate in briefly ridding yourself of 'the sadness' I recommend having them inject nacho cheese into everything you order. Even if you get a Nacho Cheese Loaded Taco, tell them to add nacho cheese. They may say... ""It has nacho cheese.""  Just scream, ""do it ANYway! Do it NOW!"" And then grab at something fiercely... like the seats or your husband.  I really enjoy the new Watermelon Freeze they have and I hope they never get rid of it. But they will... obviously, because they can't have something on the menu that actually serves as a realistic light treat. That's why they have the pack of cinnamon buns or whatever those are; try eating one without crying afterwards and drooling a bit, I double dog dare you.   I took off two stars because the Loaded Taco Nacho Spicy thing had actual jalapenos on it and I was completely disgusted. The idea of finding actual food mixed in with all the stuff they serve you is upsetting and I'm almost positive it'll make me sick later. Little suggestion Taco Bell, just make like a green paste and call it ""Ultimate Jalapeno Sauce."" Or... Green Fire. Or Ácido Estomacal Special.  P.S. We love you Taco Bell Meridian. We won't give up on you and we know you'll eventually find a staff that becomes the family that feeds us Fourth Meal on those nights we abandon our hopes and dreams and remember part of being human is putting as much salt and sugar in our mouth as we can find and then passing out until something or someone makes us breathe again. #thanoswasright",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"We decided to give this place a try tonight because we wanted seafood and wanted it close to home.  I knew going in that it was owned by Ruby Tuesday, and was hoping that it would be better than that particular nightmare.  It was, but it wasn't without some pretty big issues.  On the good side, our server was very friendly and very efficient.  In fact, part of our dinner conversation was centered on how nice he was.  The red sangria was pretty good, with plenty of strawberry pieces.  On the meh side, the salad was beyond basic and appeared to be a bag of lettuce dumped into a plastic bowl and topped with store bought croutons. My fiance ordered the grilled shrimp and blackened scallops and seemed to enjoy them, but the plate was a little light for $17.  My blackened salmon came out burnt to crispy the first time, and still a little too well the second time.  A requested crab leg add on came out hot and tasty, but really small for the price and served without a cracker.  I'm pretty good at getting through crablegs with my bare hands, but the cracker would have been very helpful with the claw, which I had to MacGuyver open with a dinner fork and just pray that I didn't send a shell fragment flying across the room.  All in all, the meal was decent for a place in a Target parking lot, but not as good as I would hope for the prices.  I will try them again though and see if some of the kinks are not just new place growing pains.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Visited Wednesday evening w/o a reservation at 5pm.  Group of four.. informed we could dine if we could be done eating by a 6:45 (a reserved table) ok?   We sat with the most ""meh"" of a waiter. He was ""meh"" with everything. Tasty appetizeer of sirloin & peppadew peppers. One entree the pork was way over cooked. I ordered a rare steak as did my wife(only I was the one w/ food poisoning (btw... I often consume 6 week old chili& pizza, never get ill) in the evvening).

"I'm not all that sophisticated when it comes to sushi, but this is one of the best I've been to. The service is awesome.  I lean toward cooked sushi, it's a texture thing, I think.  The ingredients were fresh, with no funky fishy tastes.  Came here on Friday night with my husband at 7:30.  The place was packed and we had about a 30 minute wait. Once seated, the service was quick and we never had to wait long for a roll.  The menu lists cooked sushi and raw sushi which is cool for me because I like cooked. They have a great variety.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Shelly was super nice and she checked on everyone. We went simple and got two side salads. We both got the flat bread pizza and let me tell you just because all the items I took pictures of look small they were all made in house and fresh.

"We have lived in Nola for a long time and have experienced a lot of different restaurants and had this place highly recommended to us. We were very underwhelmed to say the least.   The atmosphere is great, a nice little cozy place. The food and service, however, were subpar. We had delicious oysters for an appetizer but our entrees were not good at all. We got the stuffed tenderloin and short ribs. The meat was dry, the sides were seasoned poorly and neither of us finished our meals. In addition our server was in attentive and awkward. I'm pretty convinced our food sat under a heat lamp for a very long time because not only did it take forever to get to us, it was very dried up by the time it arrived.   In summary, the prices do not not reflect the quality of food and service. Way expensive for what we received. Of all the wonderful places in Nola, I wouldn't return there.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Hm, let me start by saying The King & I is good Thai food (for Edmonton) but man, the prices are expensive.  Be prepared to shell out the moola because prices are in the $16-25 range per dish.    But if your coming with a big group, here's an insider's tip because I'm such a nice guy and whatnot. Ask for the ""off the menu"" family dinner option.  It's $30 per person but worth it.  You can only order 1 seafood entree - if you want more, it's $5 extra.   This is what is included: - 3 appetizers - One entree per person - Choice of rice (steam, coconut or brown rice)  We went on Sunday for dinner (Canada Day!) to celebrate a late Father's Day/family gathering.  There were 7 of us in total so we were able to pick a variety of dishes and share it family style (the best way to eat).  For appetizers, we had: - Popcorn shrimp  - Thai calamari (in hindsight, we should have ordered something different as the popcorn shrimp and calamari were very, very similar) * Satay krung thep (chicken satay with a really tasty peanut sauce)  Entrees, we split: -  Pad Tofu Long Song (fried tofu with spinach on the bottom with peanut sauce. Not the best dish and weird that spinach is in Thai food - never had that before). * Siam Seafood Curry (seafood yellow curry - really good) - Basil Sea Bass (chilean sea bass with coloured peppers.  Sauce a bit too sweet for me.) - Pad Kai Karee (chicken with eggplant, celery and cashews) - Galanga Cashew Pork (pork with asparagus, sugar peas, cashews and Thai ginger) * Pad thai (can't get enough of good pad thai) * Char Kway Teow (flat rice noodles) * Family pot of coconut rice  * Note: The * means you should order this dish. MUST order. Got it? Good talk.  Overall, good meal and they even accommodated us for the cake that we brought in to celebrate Father's Day.  Service was super friendly and we had lots of leftovers to take home.  Good food but way over priced.  If you have the money, go for it.  If not, go somewhere else where prices are cheaper and similar quality food!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"What do you get when you cross a cheese steak and philly diner? No mayonaise, and chewy meat. How am I going to order a cheese steak IN philly at a place called PHILLY diner and get a lousy cheesesteak? I'm devastated.   I ordered mayonaise on mine, for the record. And I thought tomato and lettuce came complimentary but not here. We got charged extra for asking for it! Lame. And while our waitress was precious and sweet, she must not have understood the severity of my no mayonaise or sour cream order because I had to ask 6, I counted, times to get them. Who forgets that many times when they're waiting 2 tables? Come on now.   They also have a tiny sign up front that you barely have a chance to read because you're urged to sit and I didn't realize it was minimum 15 dollar credit charge. 10 would be more reasonable since to get to 15 I'd have to order a meal, drink, dessert, and possibly something else. Luckily my friend had cash.   To be frank, I'm a germaphobe and I didn't even dare enter the bathrooms because the floors were disgusting. I held it to save my sanity.

"Our family has held all of our annual celebrations at High Street for the past 3 years. The past few times we have noticed that the establishment has strayed off-mark. Service has become unbearable (it had always been relaxed, but almost a 25 minutes for drink refills, 1.5 hours for our meal, and another 30 minutes for our check after we refused desert) and after concluding our Mother's Day dinner with a slightly heated conversation with the owner I will make sure to not only share how disappointed we were, but to also make you aware of how arrogant the owner of this place really is. It was Mother's Day and like every other Mother's Day for the past three years it was assumed where we would go. Only this time it was with a slight hesitation. Our last trip to High Street Cafe a few months back was very disappointing, from the messed up reservation, the poor service and the guitar player who insisted on playing one notch higher than anyone trying to enjoy a conversation with their party. As familiar this place has become to our typical family gatherings, we said nothing and just felt it was an off night for everyone. So feeling that our last trip was just an off-night we decided to move forward with our plans for Mother's Day.Upon arriving, we were greeted at the door by an employee. I told them my name and than was told our table was right in front of us, in the middle of the restaurant, as you first walked into the door. Because of our last issue with the sound and my family unable to hear each other I made sure over the phone for the reservations that we would receive a table along the wall. I explained why and explained the importance of this seating arrangement. The person over the phone went a step further to say, ""Well how about I put you on one of the side tables in front of the window?"" I agreed and ended our conversation. When I brought this up to the employee she said in a very ignorant tone, ""Well that's not going to happen! Those tables just sat down."" We waited for about twenty minutes and finally got a table along the side. Hoping to keep our mom happy we kindly thanked them for accommodating us and hope to move on from this little episode. From this point is where everything really went downhill. It took over twenty minutes to even get a drink list, than another twenty minutes to get our drinks ordered. By the time we got our appetizers ordered our drinks were half gone and by the time we received them they were basically empty. We waited a little more than twenty minutes for the server to even come over to ask if we needed refills. By now the appetizers were gone. We finally got our refills and about 30 minutes later our food finally came out. My mom's jambalaya was cold. It was cold to the touch and taste. When we told our server she said, ""Well I can take it back and warm it up real fast."" When you pay 23 dollars for a plate of rice and chicken, the last thing you want is for it to be ""nuked"". We continued to have issues with things all night and asked to speak to the owner who because of the size of his establishment serves as the manager.  After we received our check and the server swipe the card we decided to ask when the owner would be over. We were told he is busy and would be right out. We knew that he was simply hiding behind the bar wall waiting for us to leave. As we got up to leave my father and I decided to approach him and question our importance as satisfied customers. His response was the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard. He told us well we don't understand things. He just got back Cuba where he ""threw little poor kids guitar strings and money because that's the type of person I am."" and ""they just appreciate to get food on their plates"" and ""You wouldn't understand since you wouldn't be able to go there."" I responded with that has nothing to do with how horrible everything was and your lack of concern for our situation.  He continued to ramble on with cocky and arrogant comments telling us that we should just be happy that he allowed us to eat in his establishment because we are not as worthy of humans as he is, and we as part of the normal crowd don't deserve good service or fresh food. I kid you not; he really spoke of himself so highly. Finally after all of his insults my dad decided to throw an insult his way by saying, ""The food sucked!"" He got so mad that my dad had the nerve to criticize his food after he had no problem with attacking our characters and labeling us as ""not good enough"".  This is where the conversation escalated to the point where we said ""Thank you and we will never be back"" and left. It was now after ten. It took three whole hours for appetizers and dinner. This man needs to be brought back to earth and shown he is as human as any of us. I understand that many of you may go and enjoy your time, but just remember about how the owner views you, and that is that you are lucky to have the privilege to dine in his establishment.

"Worst restaurant experience ever.   1. Waitress took 20 mins to take our order.  2. While ordering, asked what was in a menu item and was told ""I don't know."" 3. Wrote down every single thing we ordered and wrote it down wrong. Had to correct her.  4. Came back 15 minutes after ordering to confirm order. 5. Took 30 minutes to get beer.  6. Two people had their food arrive and then the other two people never had theirs arrive. After an hour, we were told the computer ""jumped"" and they were not making our food yet.  7. We ordered salads, that never came, even though two people got their entrees. 8. Asked to speak to a manager and were told she was ""too busy"".  9. Every table around us was also having issues whether a bill that was wrong, no service, no food, etc.  10. This was totally beyond ridiculous. We finally just put some cash on the table and left. Never going back.  11. No soda refills??? - Oh and my crunchy shrimp was so bad I ate one bite and didn't continue. I was one of the people who actually got food. I didn't dare touch the spicy tuna since it was raw. I just couldn't trust that it wouldn't make me sick after everything else going so wrong.   I would put no stars if I could.

"I chose Bangles because it was close to my hotel while traveling for business in Downingtown.  I was seated immediately, and noticed only one party of six in addition to myself.  The shopping center where they were located appeared to be new, and there were many unoccupied stores. Bangles was somewhat hidden, tucked into a corner with no signage lit after dark.  I had driven past it earlier in the evening and had not seen it.  But the food was worth hunting them down.    I only had three items, a soup called Rasam - Spicy broth of tomatoes, peppercorn, garlic, cumin, tamarind & lentils, Goat Sukha - Dry spicy mutton cubes slow cooked in exotic spices, and plain Naan.  The soup was prepared for the locals, i.e. not as spicy as you would get in India. But even though I have enjoyed very spicy Indian fare in the past, the Rasam was delicious, and tasted like nothing I've ever had before.  The Goat Sukha was in a thick glaze that also was somewhat spicy, and also delicious.  As a single, I was able to eat about 25% of it.  The rest is in my hotel refrigerator waiting for me to nuke it and enjoy it again.  Naan?  The naan was well done. What more can you say about plain naan?

"To start off, the line goes through the tiny door so it's hard to get in or out. I was in line and the guy taking orders skipped me and went to my boyfriend behind me in line to ask for his order. About 5 minutes later her comes back and he says we're good and goes to the next person without even acknowledging my presence. I had to tell him I never even ordered and he looked annoyed. I read in another review that another girl was ignored while the guy behind her was welcomed so this is concerning. He was pretty rude while telling me what they were not serving tonight. He has ear gauges and a long beard with his mustache curled (to identify him). We also noticed several code violations. The guy making the pizza touched items including a phone and then touched the pizza directly without ever washing his hands in between. The other guy with the long beard also touched items including an iPad without washing his hands in between touching that and the food. By the time I received my food I was pretty grossed out.

We decided the give this place a try and we were not disappointed.

The ""free"" bread was also very tasty and the seasoned oil was quite a nice surprise to dip in.    My dish- I had the mixed grill and it was an amazing choice.  The chicken and steak Shish were tender and juicy and had an interesting seasoning.  The lamb chop was cooked perfect medium and was flavorful.  The rice has a nice nutty flavor and compliments the pallete nicely.  The veggies were grilled to perfection but needed a touch more seasoning.

I got a Number 5: half-pound cheeseburger with everything (lettuce, tomato, mayo, onions) and their seasoned fries.   I love the fact that my order was handed to me in one of those styrofoam tray containers. None of this fishing fries out of a paper bag.

Extremely loud music that echoes throughout this small restaurant. We tried a couple of different tables but the volume of the music was more appropriate for a night club and not a restaurant.   We ordered 3 sandwiches with fountain drinks and it was $37. Pretty high for a grilled cheese.   Nobody in our group was excited with their order. Food was ok but nothing special. Probably won't return.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
Can't give it a 1 star since I did not get to eat anything. I was pretty exited to go here and drove from the east side just for it. We were checking the menu and just got our waters. One cup had a white chunk of what looked like cheese floating in it and the other had red bits of something on both inside and out. I asked for a couple new glasses and showed what was inside. Then waitress brings me two new glasses with particles on both glasses again. I canceled my appetizer and left before I got some sorta stomach bug. I really want to give this place a one star but can't since I didn't eat or drink anything.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"We stopped by the RR on the way home from the beach. A friend recommended us to give it a shot, so we did. We arrived around 6pm and it wasn't very busy for a Friday night. Our server was great! She was pleasant and on top of her game.  The menu is fairly large. They offer your typical bar fare with some entrees. All are priced very fair. We started with the crab balls. They were good! They had a nice amount of crab in them. My wife went with the crab cake and I went with the mushroom cheesesteak. The crab cake was fantastic! Packed full of crabmeat and cooked perfectly. The cheesesteak was good not great. The roll was nice and fresh. The meat was a bit overcooked and dry. They mushrooms were scarce. The fries were hot and crispy.

"The first thing I noticed was the noise.  Highway to Hell was blasting so loud it was almost painful.  I asked the girl behind the counter why it was so loud and she said, ""I think it's the music.""  ya think???  A tip off should have been the free peanuts, because if you come in hungry, you'll be a lot more hungry by the time your burgers are ready.  It took 20 minutes.  We escaped to a table outdoors where the music was not as loud, but then the torture really began. The fries were soft, heavy, and greasy.  I like my fries light and firm, like most fast food eateries.  My burger was made up of two thin patties that were crunchy around the edges. Yuck! I couldn't taste the meat.  It was like a salad on a bun with crunchy kibbles.  Had they used a bigger patty instead of the two thin ones it would have made a better tasting sandwich.  I can honestly say that I could've had a better burger for a third of the price at Wendy's.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"The day I went to Good Morning Mama's, I was on a mission. A mission to have a drunk breakfast. The loud paint, the crowd, and the really mean lady in the fur coat standing next to me were no match to stop me from achieving my goal.   I had a mimosa (too small) and Bloody Mary (had to ask for a pickle in the glass). These were finished quite quickly and the $5.50-$6 price tags began to add up.   For an entree I had the Swiss Bliss, which was similar to something you would order at Patachou, but with more grease. Definitely delicious. The corned beef hash and spam we ordered on the side we prepared in an awesome way, and I would have this corned beef hash catered to any event I ever throw...it was THAT good. GMMs only has one type of hot sauce, which is dumb for any place that serves breakfast.

"Disappointing.  We thought maybe we'd found a new mom & pop restaurant  to stop at on our regular trips through the Parish -- wrong. There was only one other occupied table when we arrived mid day.  We were seated, with no eye contact, no hello, no how are you, nothing.  Immediately we were asked what we wanted to drink.  The menu is expansive and sounds good.  The place is attractive enough.   We both ordered plates with beans and rice.  These huge plates arrived virtually empty (because they were so big).  The food was meh. What was supposed to be fried and crunchy was soft but it tasted okay.  The surprise came when the bill arrived, both plates were about $3.00 more than they were listed on the menu.  We asked for an explanation and were told we had ordered the more expensive chicken when she had asked us something like ""shredded or sliced?"".  The menu said nothing about an up-charge for sliced -  but it wasn't worth the fight to argue with her about what the menu doesn't say. We paid our bill and tipped accordingly. We're always on the lookout for new, mom & pop places to support - the hunt continues. FYI - the chips and salsa were good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Wasn't this place closed for a while for renovations? Looks the same to me. Food was OK. Mediocre diner food. As another reviewer said, the home fries tasted off. Just weird. We brought our 6 month old daughter in with a very small umbrella stroller. The owner would not allow us to keep her in her stroller. And was very unapologetic about it. Yes it's a tight space but we could have made it work. Wasn't a huge deal I suppose but it rubbed me the wrong way. We'll be supporting the businesses that are more accommodating to families.

"Sunday morning breakfast as we've done so many times before and it serves me right that I should have stuck with my favorite French Toast but alas I went with their Swiss Bliss omelette and boy was I ever disappointed. What came out I could have made much better myself. One piece of bread and what looked like the smallest 2 egg omelette I've ever seen. But that's not even the worst part, you don't need a picture just let me describe exactly what I got; eggs with a layer of melted Swiss cheese; out of the can or jar mushrooms, really, can't you even do fresh mushrooms and a scoop of sautéed spinach piled in the middle; let me tell you, there was nothing Blissful about that omelette. It gets even better, I tell my waiter Derrik how disappointed I am and he tells me that appreciates the feedback and will tell the kitchen. So I leave 1/2 my omelette and very disappointed because I drove all the way from Palm Harbor passing several great restaurants that are known for their outstanding breakfast plates only to be extremely disappointed with a sad excuse for an omelette. After giving you 5 star ratings for your French Toast and Brisket sandwich you only deserve 2 stars. A sincere apology and some sort of compensation is the only way I will return.   Seriously Jamie, why would you give your phone number when I've called twice and left a message and no one returns my call. Once you were in a meeting the second time you were away.

"Came here for the first time last night for my friend's birthday. We got there around 7:30pm just before the after dinner rush on a Saturday night. Minutes after we were seated the place was slammed.  Decor: Think Elf meets Legally Blonde meets Alice in Wonderland. The pictures don't do this place justice. Definitely go to look at their beautiful cakes and all the decor. The house and outdoor seating make you feel like you are in an alternate universe. Its equally cool and overwhelming.   Service: Lots of staff. So many dressed in pink with pink ribbons! We were seated quickly, but took a fairly long time to actually get our cakes. Seemed to me they just needed to be plated. As a group of first timers our server was so-so. He seemed annoyed that I asked questions about the cake. He didn't really talk up the menu to encourage us to try a drink.   Cake: They were out of a few popular cakes. So make sure you check the cake counter before your heart is set on one. I got the cotton-candy cake. The name turned me off, but the server made it clear that its just strawberry and vanilla cake. So that's important to note. The cake was really tasty, but the icing was non-distinct. It was like white, fluffy foam icing. I would have appreciated a richer buttercream frosting. There was also so much frosting compared to the amount of cake.   I tried the caramel cake, the millionaire, and the ellington. Everyone enjoyed their cakes in a general sense. They all were pretty good, including mine, but will I go back? Not sure. I'm not going to complain about the price-- there are plenty of negative reviews about that. I just kind of wish the flavors of the cake made the $13 worth it!   Full-disclosure: There is something subtly creepy about this place. Also, I might have had a dream about small pigs last night. (Pigs are a part of their decor scheme-- maybe because they are pink.. not sure.)   There's definitely a market for a place like this! This would be the absolute perfect venue for a bridal shower, baby shower, women's tea/luncheon event, or to celebrate a girl's birthday.

"Full disclosure: I am a Mexican food snob (having learned to eat and appreciate Mexican food while living in southern California for 9 years).   NOLA, as much as I love the plethora of great eats and the foodie tradition of our great city, the choices for ""Mexican"" food here--and pretty much everywhere throughout the Deep South--are HORRIBLE. I take a lot of sh#t from friends here who think I'm ridiculous in my criticisms of local NOLA Mexican fare, but I'm really not as unreasonable (or as fancy) as they think I am. Good Mexican food is NOT fancy. It's fresh! It's seasoned! For me, Mexican food embodies the ""less is more"" concept more than almost any other ethnic cuisine I can think of. Little things like fresh made salsa, flavorful marinated meats, fresh creamy refried beans, fresh veggies, and even fresh tortillas etc go a LONG way and they are the staple of any good mexican chef, including at-home cooks.   I f#cking HATE, HATE, HATE Juan's Flying Burrito. Worst place(s) EVER. Seriously, it is beyond me how anyone could think Juan's is good. They have ""burrito"" in their name and they can't even roll a burrito correctly. You unwrap one from the foil they serve it in and it immediately falls apart. The ingredients are bland, dry, the salsa is jarred and crappy... the guacamole is jarred/store bought, processed sh#t... a cardinal sin in my book. Superior Grill is way better if you want mediocre Tex-Mex. I like Filipe's when I need a burrito fix. It's not the greatest, but they know how to roll a friggin' burrito and it's at least half-way decent and you can get cilantro wrapped in your burrito... and they have fresh made salsas/salsa picantes.   Well, I recently went to The Velvet Cactus and I was pleasantly surprised! First, I love that the owners tout the cuisine as ""Mexican inspired."" They have obviously had real authentic Mexican cuisine and do not feel comfortable claiming their cuisine is ""Mexican"". Kudos to them for their honesty. The irony is their cuisine is better and more ""authentic"" than most other Mexican places in the city. FINALLY!!!! I find a place that makes FRESH and good salsa and fresh-made guacamole. I got some chicken tacos and the meat was cooked perfectly, seasoned well and everything tasted fresh. The beans were FRESH, creamy, and wonderful! While the cuisine may not be 100% authentic Mexican, the owners obviously pride themselves on using fresh ingredients, which is a huge step up from any other Mexican-ish joint I have tried in NOLA. The only other place that comes close is El Gato Negro, though their food is hit or miss for me. I went back a few days later and had Velvet's bean burrito which was great! Beans were cooked perfectly, fresh, flavorful. I  also had the Habanero infused tequila margarita and it was awesome!   If I was rich and had the money, even as a gringo, I would open a Mexican restaurant in NOLA that would blow everything out of the water and it would be a guaranteed success because most of the competition out there is pitiful... but until I get rich, when I need my (Tex)Mexican fix, I will continue to go to the Velvet Cactus. F#CK Juan's and Superior Grill. On top of the good food, the ambience and decor of the Velvet Cactus is interesting and well-done. The service has been pretty good and the wait staff seems friendly. Definitely a diamond in the rough of the Mexican food desert that is NOLA.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I remember with fondness my first meal in their dining room in 2000. I wax poetic to many a friend about their brioche. I would dream of the brioche. I had a solo venture on my latest trip. $115.  2 glasses of wine, garlic soup, pumpkin brioche which now must be ordered and has a $5 charge, and monk fish over lentils, espresso. Starting at the beginning: wine reccomended not at all what I described to be looking for; garlic soup doesn't play as well in 2014 as it did in 2000; brioche was dry and not really appealing; monk fish was delicious and cooked perfectly the lentils were not delightful; and the espresso was just fine.

I was told to pull up to wait for the french toast sticks, which I did.  I waited for close to 7 minutes when a surly lady came out with one small bag.  The bag had one sandwich, the french toast sticks, and a side of hash brown that I did not order.  I told her, ""Excuse me, ma'am.  I'm missing one sandwich.""  Her response was an angry, ""Well back up and tell her at the window, because she's the one who gave me the bag.""  I rolled back through the drive through and told the person at the window that I was missing a sandwich.  They took some time to get me the other sandwich.

"Very good kaiseki restaurant with attention to detail, though a number of things were disappointing.  There is a menu from which you select dishes you would like as part of a 7 course meal. If you are (hopefully) dining with another person, then you'll be able to try almost everything on the menu. There are 7 courses, but I was able to try nearly 14 different dishes (!):  - #1 Assorted Appetizers - I love variety and this ""platter"", if you will, had many distinct items - wagyu beef or pork belly, abalone, fish cakes, fried tofu, and jellyfish. The abalone was very tender and flavorful. Pork belly was unctuous. Fish cakes and tofu were surprisingly good -- great texture and flavor. Fantastic start!  - #2 Soup - a. Clear soup with egg cake b. Clear soup with steamed tomato Both nothing to write home about. More of palate cleanser, I suppose?  - #3 Sashimi - GORGEOUS presentation. Chef's selection was salmon from Japan (less oily than American), squid, and red snapper (?). The sashimi itself was nice, but not much more. I do very much appreciate the real, grated wasabi though.  - #4 Grilled Dish - a. Lobster tail with red miso - Pretty good b. Duck breast - Even better! They marinate this in a delicious sweet soy sauce and the tenderness is unreal. I'm glad they kept the skin on with its fat, because that added a lot to the flavor.  - #5 Steamed Dish - a. Marinated sweet fish with roe - Awful. The flavor was extremely heavy in terms of its sweetness and smokiness. It was like eating mushy tar. b. Steamed rock fish simmered in sweet broth - Overly sweet and salty, although quite nice  - #6 Sushi - Chef's selection: Crab leg, scallop, and Santa Barbara (!) uni I was expecting more. The crab leg and scallop didn't have much flavor and the uni was good, but I've had better.  - #7 Dessert - Both desserts came with a wedge of dried persimmon, which we were instructed to eat first a. Black sesame custard - Not very sweet, had plenty of black sesame flavor b. Green tea custard - Very nice, wish I had more than a few spoonfuls!  Overall, the good outweighed the bad -- I'd rate it more like 3.5 stars. The food was clearly conceived by a skilled kaiseki chef. Our server was pleasant, helpful, and attentive.  Unrelated to the food/service, but I thought the interior design was strange. It was very Japanese in that it was simple with natural tones, but with Denny's-style hanging lamps over the tables, and an almost anachronous chandelier and ceiling-mounted A/C unit.  For $100, it's a reasonable price for a 7-course meal. Just make sure you don't pick some of the items I mentioned above and you'll have a lovely experience!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I usually don't put reviews but this is a must. Put in an online order. 2 burgers and fries. Should have been ready by the time I go in to pick it up. Waited 10 minutes and everyone has been helped and there's no line. I go up and ask about my online order and they didn't even start it. Apparently their printer was not feeding back to the kitchen. When I paid for it if they were having problems all day they should have verified my order was being worked on. I probably would have my food by now if I would have just ordered to go normally.

"I love ramen. But usually, I feel kinda stupid getting ramen at a restaurant when I can usually make comparable ramen at home at 1/10th of the price. I did NOT regret coming here and wished I had time to visit them again before I left Tuscon. It was THAT good  I got the extra spicy pork ramen which was absolutely delicious, rich, creamy, spicy, aromatic. The broth was out of this world. The best part? The dish was around 9 dollars with tax. I could have been satisfied with just this dish but I also opted to try some of the sushi. Admittedly I was a little skeptical about the quality of raw fish in Tuscon and while the sushi served here is absolutely Americanized (with avocado, imitation crab, and other ingredients not found in traditional sushi) it doesn't mean it wasn't delicious. I got the Ikkyu rolls which had tuna, imitation crab, avocado in an uramaki style presentation.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quick, affordable and delicious meal with the caveat that it caters to more Americanized tastes (especially the sushi). If I worked nearby I would go here for lunch everyday.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Extremely disappointed in the service we received. The place wasn't busy and the food was decent...  But the service was the main issue. We were promptly seated and the waiter took our order in a timely manner. Drinks were served in a timely manner as well. Food took what felt like forever. After the waiter bringing over an edamame appetizer (which we did not order), I figured it was complimentary since the food was taking so long (which he had complimented that it would be out soon, somewhat acknowledging that it was taking a while). Food finally arrived and was placed on the table...  I ordered two items for my dinner and only received one when the food was placed. We asked for ketchup and the waiter told us he would be right back with it... I figured at the time he brought the ketchup, he would also bring the second part of my meal. It never happened. I got up, on my own, and walked across the restaurant to grab ketchup. Our waiter never came back. He never refilled our drinks. He never checked on us. He never came back until we were finished. I politely asked to speak to the manager. After a few minutes she came out and I explained how horrible the service was. She explained to me that she had two new servers that night and she was wondering how the night would go. I also mentioned never getting the second part of my meal and her response was simply that the order never came back to the kitchen. She asked if there was anything else she could do for us and I told her no... That we were finished. At this point, I'm expecting at least some sort of compensation for the crappy service. Maybe comp my glass of wine?  Dessert on the house?  Nothing. Absolutely nothing. And when the bill came to the table, we had actually been charged for the edamame appetizer. I explained to the waiter that we had not ordered that. He removed it from the bill and returned to the table with the final bill. No apology at all from him. I left a small tip and will never be back. At this rate, this place will not last much longer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I have to give them props for the service. Our server was so quirky and hilarious. He was really trying to give us a stellar/friendly/entertaining experience and he did. At first I was like ""is this guy for real"" then I realized that I am like that with my customers at my job and they seem to not judge me, so I should just go with it. And go with it I did.  The food was expensivooooo but pretty good. We go there in the late afternoon- by the time we left, place was PACKED with kids running around and smashing things. Not my scene at the moment, but I feel very welcomed here if I had kids of my own.  Side note, the booth I sat in was ripped and the bathroom floor was falling apart. A small renovation would do them justice. But then again, maybe it's the whole kid thing?  A nice alternative to Bay Street and great service.

"Anticipated the opening ever since harvest closed.  Tried going the other night but it was too crowded.  Went back tonight and probably won't be returning.  Took about 10 minutes for our server to visit our table.  We gave her our full order to save time.  I ordered breakfast and was told that the toaster might not be working she would have to check.  She returned with drinks except for my coffee but I didn't say anything thinking she would be bringing it next.  Next she brought soup and salad for my parents.  I reminded her about my coffee and got a cold response that she knew about it.  About 10 minutes later one of the managers visited the table and asked if everything was good.  I told him I was still waiting for my coffee and he said he would take care of it.  I watched as he said something to our server and she looked not so thrilled that I brought it to his attention.  She brought the coffee a few minutes later and just slid it onto the table.  No apology for forgetting it or the wait.  Kind for grumpy too.  Food finally came out.  Other than than the cold toast, my food was fine.  Can't say the same for my dad's open face sandwich with luke-warm gravy or mom's spaghetti dinner without bread.  Overall, our server was rather rude.  Poor communication skills and probably not enough training.  The place didn't seem like it was staffed appropriately to be open.  Kind of shocked that the same ownership group as Sage would  be this unprepared.  Maybe it will improve but in the mean time I won't be returning.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"This is an OK stop if you happen to be really hungry for Chinese and don't want to drive very far. It's clean enough and the customer service is decent. Their home made plum sauce is good as in their home made mustard.  They are not bad but they are not that good either. You can get better versions of their foods in other restaurants. We ordered Mongolion beef (My go-to dish to test how a Chinese restaurant cooks). It's a simple, very basic dish that, if done well, can be amazing. But if done wrong, it can be horrible. Theirs was simply, ok. While the portion for 10.50 was large, it was, in all honesty, mostly onions. The meat was good but there wasn't 3 ounces of meat in the entire meal.  We also got an order of Crab Rangoons. That's The Girly's pick for testing out a Chinese restaurant. Now we both know neither of those things are truly Chinese dishes, but they are great ways to test the food. These were sweet and had no crab flavor at all. They were not terrible, just not great.  I'd rather head over  to China Gate or Hong Minh (Especially Hong Minh) unless I'm just starving.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I was told it was 1/2 a chicken;it was really 2 tiny pieces, with a whole onion and tomato cut to fill out the container.  What a rip off.  Second time, I just wanted 2 Garlic Naans. It took 20 minutes! The girl behind the counter apologized, but it didn't make me feel any better. good thing I didnt order any actual food.Naan was good and hot at least.  While the food is just ok, it's places like this that give Indian food a bad name.

"Not the usual amazing level of attentive service during our birthday brunch celebration. Our server seemed overwhelmed, maybe more staff would help? Having chosen Not Your Average Joe's based on my past experiences, I was disappointed this time. It took 20 minutes for my bloody mary to arrive from the bar we were sitting right by. The server never asked about allergies, poorly explained the menu, forgot the small brunch menu, had to be reminded to bring the other drinks ordered from the bar as well. He never refilled out waters, and didn't really check back to see how we were doing during the meal.  We were celebrating so it wasn't a big deal to sit for longer than the usual times to receive our food. The breakfast potatoes were so over salted, I mean gross!

The food was good. The service was pretty bad. I'm not sure if it is because of covid but the hostess and waiter both seemed very impatient and rushed. After the waiter took our order we were waiting for about 20 minutes and then he brought the check out before we even received our food. And he scurried off before we could ask about it. That was the last we ever heard from him for the rest of our visit. We waited about 10 more minutes and asked the waitress at the table next to us about our food.

"This is an interesting predicament with this place. Read the other reviews and notice how all the Yelpers are from different parts of the country. Whether you're a native to the gulf, or passed through this restaurant on vacation, it's clear that people either loved it or hated it. I  personally didn't care for it. Does that mean you'll hate it? Maybe, maybe not. I think the place has some good things going for it. Chill has good ambiance, an appetizing menu selection, and a friendly staff. My visit was a bit unsatisfying though. .  Sunday brunch- starving. We voted nay to Waffle House, and couldn't find an iHop. We thanked god in heaven when we found this place. ---I ordered a skillet breakfast but didn't like it after a couple bites. Waitress was nice and quick to get me something else. ---Bathroom was absolutely disgusting. I went in just to wash my hands. It was horrific. I can guarantee that sink hasn't seen any bleach in at least a month. Unacceptable ---They fresh squeeze their orange juice. Definitely awesome. But when I asked for a second glass, waitress said they had ran out. Sad face  I think the owner of Chill is trying, but then again might be missing the bigger issue because most of these people are just passing through.

"The reviews on Yelp have led me astray. When I went online and looked up breakfast places and saw the amazing cinnamon roll pancakes at Baja, I really wanted to go. And it seemed like it would be a great place since it received a 4.5 star on Yelp. When we got there early Saturday morning around 10, there was about a 30-40 minute wait. The waiter we had was super attentive and filled up my coffee really quickly. It was one of the best parts of the place. I ordered my cinnamon roll pancake with a side of eggs over easy, hash browns, and sausage patties. My boyfriend ordered the smoked brisket machaca huevos rancheros. My cinnamon roll pancake came out quite quickly and almost burnt looking. It was an interesting taste and I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. It just didn't taste anything like a cinnamon roll. I wished it was softer and more melt in your mouth as opposed to caramelized and crunchy. My eggs, hash browns, and sausages were average and reminded me of something I would get at a chain diner like Denny's or IHOP. The hash browns were a bit greasy and the sausages weren't tasty or noteworthy. My boyfriend was incredibly disappointed with his dish, too. The corn tortillas were soggy and flaky; it was hard to eat the meal without them falling apart. The smoked brisket was overly smoky and had no other flavor. It was like I was tasting just liquid smoke. We definitely thought the wait and price wasn't worth our meal.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I looked at the Yelp photos & many of them are a year to 3 years old.  My dinner companion decided to share everything we chose.  We ordered two rounds of their specialty cocktails (Fair Verona & Just Be Simple) they were mixed extremely well & delicious.  Next, we decided on something lighter to start, the grilled carrots; a bit small in both portion & actual size of the carrots.  I would categorize this appetizer as mini grilled carrots.  We also ordered the arugula salad; love arugula, the dressing was refreshing, but not enough pickled apples or blue cheese.  For the entrees, we chose trofie pasta with braised rabbit and the tenderloin with risotto, both were tasty, cooked perfectly, and each bite was mouth watering.

It's fine. I ordered take out from here instead of my normal thai place. The prices were quite a bit higher for the same portions. We ordered the pad thai and green curry. The green curry was fine however it did taste much sweeter than I was used to. The only reason I gave three stars instead of four is because of the pad thai. For the pad thai I was given a container of spices to add myself. Which I guess makes sense? They didn't ask for spice level for take out so I guess they assume you'll figure it out. The only issue is I don't make thai food and have no clue the ratios of spice to food. So it's quite a gamble to risk an already expensive dish? I'd rather they just ask the spice level instead of leaving it up to the customer to finish making their own food.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

No big deal it was obviously lunch rush.  I went into the bathroom to get some paper towels and soap to wash a table myself.  There was no paper towels or soap.. I was even okay with that and used water and napkins.  It wasn't until I saw TWO employees go in and use that restroom and come right back out and start serving people again that I became thoroughly disgusted.  Neither employee went back in to refill soap or paper towels and neither employee came out with their hands dripping wet so I knew they didn't even use water. Gross .. Never again.

Good selection of beers, but would love to see more sours on the menu. As a table we shared pretzel balls, bruschetta, and pizza rolls and all of these were great!  As the night went on beer service started to slow down assuming due to the bar getting busier.  Entrees were just okay.  Burgers were overcooked and nothing special.  Fries were good though.  Server ended up having a lot of trouble splitting the checks for the three parties at the table to the point of us having to note on each of the checks who had what and on the third attempt to get them split correctly she finally gave up and had the manager attempt to fix them.

"The only thing that helped our visit was the fact that earlier that week they were running a special of Buy One Get One Gift Certificates. We purchased $150.00 worth of gift certificates and received $300.00. Thought this would be plenty for a party of 4.  Everyone had 2 drinks and the four of us split 2 desserts. Bill was OVER $400.00. That was crazy insane as we experienced lack luster service, just OK food and wait times of nearly 45 minutes for appetizers and nearly 30 minutes for entrees.  Service was OK. Just OK. She was an OK server. However, we were not eating at the Olive Garden, so I thought the service would be on point, helpful, gracious and genuine. Nope, I was wrong.  Food was OK and some was sub par. When my baked potato tastes better than my $37 entree, there is a problem.  Drinks were OK.   And to set the entire tone of the evening, dessert was just OK. We didn't finish the mushy bread pudding or the tasteless donuts.  And yes, we constantly asked about the wait times, very nicely I would like to add. We asked about the entrees that were rather boring. We asked about our appetizers that tasted freezer burnt.   We continue to receive half ass answers from people that simply didn't know any difference.  Very Disappointed. Very Over Priced.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I got the Hoosier tenderloin sandwich. The problem is that I had Popeye's Chicken sandwich like a week ago and I clearly remember it well. I know its pork vs chicken but they are both breaded, fried and have similar textures. The Popeye's chicken sandwich is also like half the price. The pork is pounded down so it looks larger than it actually is. I enjoyed it but I couldn't help but think about Popeye's. I got a side of corn with butter and it was exactly what I expected.  My wife got the beef and noodles. Think of noodles with gravy sauce and beef chunks. The rest of the sides of coleslaw and mashed potatoes and roll were very average.

"Plain Jane...  So...in Tampa on convention this past week and hear about the place from a few people during my travels...so last night I decide to take the Trolly from the Marriot.  I had one lady tell me that her brother was from NY (my town) and he ONLY ate sushi at this place when he was in town and he swore it was better than any place in NY.  (that should have been my BEST reason not to go...what was I thinking?)  I really don't have much of a detailed Yelp so to speak because, well, quite frankly there was almost nothing to Yelp about.  The food was not bad, it just was average.  I had a hard time finding even ONE original sounding roll, they were all very plain, and also had many of the same stuff over, and over, and over.....you get the picture.  Also, a peeve of mine is rice...there was SO much rice on these rolls it was actually bloating and took from the flavor of what little fish was actually in the roll...and trust me, I pulled the rice off a few pieces just to see at first how much, or little fish there was.    Food was very fresh though, sashimi was excellent, no complaints on quality which is the only reason they even are getting Three stars.  This places challenge lies in its creativity, and other than the high ceiling which drew my attention (which by the way is because the building is an old Theatre), there was nothing worthy of a return trip for this place.  Read other reviews of mine for Tampa as I went to quite a few places in the Tampa/Ybor city area this past week if you are interested.  I was in Downtown Tampa.

"I love the feel of this place.  It's going to be one of my winter getaways.  It has great window seating all around the perimeter of the building, lots of light, you can see your food being cooked, and the seating is comfortable!  The menu is just the right size for pizza toppings and other food options.  All ingredients seem extremely fresh and the service was great.  We had the artichoke dip and the spinach cheese etc seemed fresh not frozen.  If it was they certainly fooled me.  The pita chips that it came with were not crunchy.  The server apologized for this.  Apparently they make it in house and he chef didn't let it rise enough or something.  I don't know, but being bread lovers, we still loved it.  Personally I do like it better with tortilla chips so a crispy pita chip might have been better.  Regardless we loved it.     We had the The Blues and Magherita pizza.  We are traditionalist when it comes to pizza.  If the sausage is great and the cheese is heavy we are in heaven.  No pepperoni lovers in this family!  So when we saw the sausage was homemade, we were on it.   I was reading Yelp in making my decision for our second pizza hence the Blues choice.  I was heavily persuaded by Garret to get the honey wheat crust.  I was so against it.  I even warned him I will be mad if I didn't like it.  So you're thinking oh no high maintenance?  Yes I am and wow we loved the crust so much we'll get it on all of our future pizzas!  I must admit all the food was good but I didn't rave over the Blues when it was fresh.  However, I loved it left over.  The flavors melted well together.  I will definitely try the Wolf on my next visit and request extra cheese because I like a lot of it.    The pizzas are big enough to be shared so if you buy 2 for 2 people, be prepared to take some home.  They have great to go containers and unlike other specialty pizza places they do to go orders.  Thank you!  I believe our waiters name was Garret and he's great and being cute doesn't hurt either.  This is a place I definitely will return to before a ball game, the art museum, The Fox etc.  The food comes out fresh and in just the right amount of time.

"Let's talk about Grace Meat + Three...Wow! Absolutely incredible.  I grew up in southern Missouri where fried catfish, chicken, and about anything else you can drop into boiling grease are staples so when it comes to fried fish I can be pretty particular.  This was seriously some of the best catfish I have ever had.  I've been twice now and the first time I had their catfish Nashville Hot style (think buffalo style but with fish).  Life-changing!  I had never had fish prepared like a hot wing and it was incredible.  Pretty hot so if you don't like spicy I would just get the regular. I split a pound of this with a full Grace Waldorf salad (which features apples, buttermilk lime dressing, and candied nuts on top) and it was way more food than the two of us could eat but it was so good.  Next time I'll go for half a pound. On my second visit I had Chicken biscuit with hot honey and a side of cornbread.  The chicken biscuit was really good, I'm glad I got it.  The hot honey was a nice compliment to the chicken making it a pretty savory dish.  I love cornbread and got that as a side, but I have to say it was a little disappointing for me.  I am more of a sweet corn bread type of person and it was not prepared that way.  That being said, everything else I've had or have had friends get looked and tasted exceptional.

Cannot express how much I love the simple freshness of the food. You can make a wrap (gluten free of course) or a bowl. You get a lot of choices for protein and toppings all of which are crisp and flavorful. You also get 2 sauces and they are all very different. I went the traditional route and did:  Falafel - baked & gluten free!  Black rice - cooked to perfection Cucumber salad - traditional nothing special Beets-  that we a little bit sweet (made the whole dish to cut the acidity of sauce and cuc salad) Feta - sharp with salty notes Mmm Tahini sauce Traditional Tzatziki Sauce - it was a little thick for my taste but was mellow.

"The best part about eating at Milkfish is you are right across the street from Angelo Brocato gelati, where you can indulge and forget your sorrows from an exceptionally bad meal. I say exceptional because after eating out at a new place with my dining partner, virtually every week since we met about 8 months ago, Milkfish takes the gold medal at the wrong end of the spectrum.   We began with the appetizer sampler. It was an array of fried foods and a chicken skewer was thrown in there for good measure. The first bite of spring roll went down quickly and satisfactorily because we waited 30-40 minutes before the appetizer arrived. Not even the mediocre cocktail would keep us adequately distracted for that long. There were chunks of pork belly that were first roasted and then deep-fried to theoretically make them crispy. Perhaps if it had been properly roasted first, to the point that the connective tissue had broken down and enough of the excess fat had rendered out, then the method of flash-frying would have worked the way they wanted. Nope! Since they didn't, we contended with blocks of gooey, gristley, un-crispy (despite the characterization on the menu) fatty pork belly--fat in more of a gelatin consistency than melt-in-your-mouth. Add that we weren't supplied knives, and we wrestled to eat these chewy chunks that were twice the size of a sushi roll.   Believe it or not, the pork bell was NOT the most inedible item on the appetizer platter. The crispy pork tail, a mélange of jiggly fat and spine-like vertebrae with little bits of dry, flavorless meat stuck inside. I felt like I was trying to harvest the meat out of the legs of a lobster, except in that case, I would have also had a tail and claws that were full of meat. Add to this that the platter, presumably to be shared, came with only one of these undesirable culinary ""frustrators,"" and it was an $18 platter. Because of the unlikelihood that a restaurant will fail so miserably at preparing some items, but excel at others, I will spare you discussion of the rest of the platter items.  Milkfish continued its trend of serving inedible food items with the entrees. My dining partner astutely described the ""Pancit Malabon"" as a less-flavorful Pad Thai, and that was too kind. The dish came garnished with a fried fish head and tail. The body, containing all of the meat, was mysteriously absent. As I searched through the head, I found morsels of parched meat next to the shriveled eye, sunken into its socket. I felt more like a tenant of a dungeon than a patron paying $20 for this dish.  I ordered the mix of pork face meat and sautéed chicken livers, topped with a sunny-side up egg, and served with garlic fried rice. My first reaction was the portion was too small. After the first bite, I realized it would be more than enough. The pork was likely belly again, as it was pieces with layers of meat, then fat, and of course, the fat was undesirably jiggly. Do you know what happens when you overcook chicken livers, or any liver for that matter? Aside from becoming generally disgusting, they get tough, the texture turns gritty, and they taste like they were marinated alongside rusty metal. I suppose the sunny-side up egg could act as a moistening binder, aww, but beside the yolk was a pool of undercooked egg white. Undercooked egg whites are reminiscent of two things, the ""better"" of which is colorless phlegm. On to the rice...If you describe rice as ""fried,"" there should be some evidence that it was, in fact, fried. This rice was neither fried, nor garlic-flavored.   I was starving when I went to Milkfish, but I left about 95% of my entrée on the plate. It was an instance in which I could not physically stomach the food served to me. After tax and tip, we were $70 deep. Milkfish twisted the knife it didn't serve us with our food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Next as I'm waiting for someone to come take my order, holding a menu that I only think was the correct one another employee walks up to me and says hi. I say hi back and ask if I have the correct menu, he responds with ""we are actually all closed up. I tell him the woman I just spoke to stated that I could place a Togo order. He goes ""oh a Togo order"" with attitude at this point I was fed up with their laziness. I told him never mind and I left. As I sit in the parking lot writing this review it became clear to me as to why he had such an attitude as he left for the day about 4 minutes after I walked out. I have never had the opportunity to try this place and today I was in the area . after hearing  so many good reviews l was excited to try their sushi. I will never get to try this place because of this experience and honestly after seeing this place from the outside and in it is not visually appealing either.

"Love the crust, the price, the speed of orders and the fact that one may choose as many toppings as one wants for the same price!  The only criticism I have is the acoustics in there.  Because of the high ceilings and all of the noise, it is extremely difficult to hear what the pizza makers are saying.   They must think we are all deaf because everyone keeps asking them to repeat what they said!  Also, when they call the name for the orders that are complete, it's hard to hear what they are calling.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I cannot conceive how anyone who's had delicious Thai in their lifetime could possibly rate this take out joint better than two stars.   That's right, take out joint because during my entire dining experience there were more walk in take orders than there were actual dining customers.  I ordered some dish called crazy noodles that looked more like pappardelle. I chose this dish because of the colorful array of vegetables that were supposed to be on my plate, that was chipped, by the way! Yes yelp, my food was brought to me on a chipped plate! I had about two pieces of broccoli and a few strips of peppers. My food was cold as well.  We chose to eat indoors, however we should have eaten outside where I'm certain there would have been less flies. Thai happens to be one of my favorite cuisines and this experience just left a bad taste in my mouth.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"When we first learned about Five Guys burgers we were driving to West End in Nashville to get them. We're so glad that Five Guys is finally nearby! The burgers are always fresh and made-to-order and delicious. So delicious that we considered getting rid of our grill. Then we remembered that we also grill chicken and steak on occasion:/  Not too many things are more satisfying on a Friday night after a long work week than a big brown bag of their burgers and fries. And we love their fries. No matter how you you like your burger topped there are over 250,000 possible combinations (and that's according to them). You should find something you like. If not, then you shouldn't be eating a burger.  They have hotdogs but we've never tried them. I'm sure there equally yummy.  Fun fact...The French fries must be shaken 15 times exactly, and onion and bacon go below the patty while pickles and tomato go above.  Great food and great service. They're a proven chain that hasn't dropped their commitment to making our bellies happy! Thanks for coming to Hendersonville!!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I love Thai food and have had it all over the country, dine in, to go and often delivered and this was by far the worst ever. Not one single thing was edible. The ""fresh"" rolls were sweaty and smelled horrible. The peanut sauce was some watery sweet and sour sauce with some mushy crushed peanuts thrown in and just as bad as the rolls. The Tom Yum Hed was super salty and I actually ordered Yum Goong which sounded really good but after the experience with shrimp fresh rolls maybe it was just as well. The sticky rice was so hard it was completely inedible. Truly one of the worst dining experiences ever.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"We were happy to try Hi-Pointe Drive-In on it's opening day and were surprisingly able to get delivery with no problem (we're in their ~3 mile delivery radius). The food arrived relatively quickly, too, which was awesome. We're huge fans of Sugarfire Smoke House's location in Olivette and order delivery from there quite often, so having another local delivery option with the genius of Mike Johnson. I'm really interested to see how often (if at all) they'll rotate their menu options, as I adore checking Sugarfire's Facebook for the latest, daily specials.  Anyway, I had the Roast Beef Sandwich, which features ""chimichurri, brie and charred onion."" I wasn't sure what to expect; typically a ""roast beef"" sandwich is just sliced meat and call it a day but this was big, sexy chunks of beef that were perfectly cooked and positively delicious. The chimichurri was out of control delicious (I love capers) and while I didn't taste the brie very much I'm sure it was still there. I ended up adding a sauce to the sandwich because despite the toppings it still felt a little dry (except for the meat, which was juicy as hell). The bread it was served on was absolutely delicious, as well. I'm going to order one again today - I've been thinking about it every day.  My boyfriend got a burger (not sure which one, just one of the ""normal"" ones) that honestly didn't look very good - that isn't to say it didn't taste good, just that it was very smooshed and sad-looking. The bun wasn't very special. He said it tasted pretty good although did note that it was definitely overcooked. He said he's going to go with the Taco Burger next time, which I've noticed is getting a lot of positive attention.  We ordered fries, mac and cheese and brussels sprouts as sides. The fries were pretty good, as expected, and I really enjoyed the mac and cheese. I have a personal agenda for getting Sugarfire Smoke House to sell mac and cheese every day so I was really happy to see it as a static side here. It reminded me of ""cafeteria"" mac and cheese and it was totally delicious. We didn't get around to actually eating the brussels sprouts unfortunately; my partner noted that they smelled weird (we eat brussels sprouts regularly) so that was likely from the seasoning. Not sure if we'll order them again, but they're probably pretty good.  The only real let-down of the order was the milkshake. I ordered the Strange Donuts collab gooey butter shake and he ordered a butterscotch shake (he loves butterscotch and was really excited to see it as an option). I've had shakes delivered from both Sugarfire and Fozzie's Sandwich Emporium (regularly) so I'm generally familiar with how much the texture will change just due to transit. It is pretty cold outside, so I had a feeling they didn't really melt much at all. The problem was just the texture in general - the shake was VERY thin and ice-y. My partner said his tasted more like iced skim milk, and mine was probably an even bigger disappointment because the donut hole that was mixed up in it just gave the whole thing a very mealy, unpleasant mouthfeel. It was generally extremely lacking in flavor and I ended up throwing it out.  We're huge ice cream snobs, so my executive snobby opinion is that they either they're using lower quality ice cream with very high overrun (which shouldn't be the case; I think Sugarfire uses Ronnie's which isn't super-super premium but still a good option) or the ice cream wasn't stored properly and excessive ice crystals had formed. Alternately, they could actually be adding ice to the blend which would be daffy as heck but who knows. I'll definitely stop in to try a shake in-house so that there's no potential compromise to the structural integrity or whatever, but for this specific order they were a total bust.  I'm sure we'll be ordering quite a bit in the future so I'll look forward to bumping it up to a 5-star experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"This sounds stupid but I was so hyped to try Chik-fil-A because we never had one in my area growing up. AND I FINALLY TRIED IT YESTERDAY!!!  I shared with a friend some nuggets, chicken strips, waffle fries, and a strawberry milkshake. I was pretty disappointed at how small the pieces were. However they had actual chicken texture and it was pretty good. Everyone goes wild for the Chick-fil-A sauce but I thought it was OK. I liked the Srircha and ranch sauces.   I got the medium waffle fries and it was so good. I heard they are a classic. It was a lot of fries. I loved it. And also the strawberry milkshake was dank.

"As we were heading west towards Jasper from Edmonton, we were in search of a nice vegan option for breakfast/lunch on our way out of town and discovered this great little place. Cute little place in a residential neighbourhood, all-vegan, run by a friendly woman. I phoned in our order (curry tofu wrap and tofu scramble wrap) and came to pick it up half an hour later -- the woman sure was persistent over the phone about upselling me add-ons to our order. ;-)   When we arrived, the wraps were ready, and we got some spanikopitas and coffees for the road. Both our wraps were very tasty and certainly filling. When it came time for our afternoon snacks, the spanikopitas turned out to be amazing. I never really liked spanikopitas before I went vegan, but this vegan rendition was amazing -- the tofu/spinach filling was delicious, the pastry was delectable but rather oily, and the dip it came with was the perfect accompaniment.

It's really embarrassing! Even if the person you hyped it up to is your husband, that doesn't help. I can't have my taste buds being doubted...  The sushi and dessert areas were always lacking.

"Excited that this opened up right near my house! Pizza was actually REALLY good - love the chewy thin crust! I agree with another yelper's comment about the large cherry tomatoes though. When reheating this pizza, the huge tomatoes get way too hot. And if you wait for them to cool off enough so that you can eat them, the rest of the pizza is cold. Thin slices would be better. My main complaint was with the service (although I know they are new, so hoping it will get better). Their brochure says ""Don't worry if our line is long, we move fast!"" But it was one of the slowest moving lines I had stood in for a while. I waited in line for over 30 minutes. Long enough that I decided I was going to call in my order.

It's refreshing and it has guacamole in it that perfectly mixes with the fish.The chips that come with the salmon tartar is so good! You need to try it! I believe they fry the chips in the house.  One of the few things that I like about this place is that they get their ingredients locally and change their menu according to what is in season and available. My personal favorite right now is their shrimp with grits. I'm usually not a fan of grits but the waiter convinced me to get the dish since it was his favorite dish. I was glad I got it because the grits went really well with the shrimp in this tomato based sauce. The shrimp was tender and juicy. I can't wait to try new dishes in the next season!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Their menu is huge, so there is no doubt you will find something you like. However, the service leaves A LOT to be desired. A LOT. They take 20 minutes to even bring your drink out, and will bring apps with your meal. Terrible service and rude wait staff, however, on 50% off night, I'll gladly deal with a bitchy waitress and a 20 minutes to serve diet coke. Can't beat a meal for two for ~$15.

"My last visit here was the one and only time I did not leave a tip for a server, which says a lot because I've worked for tips before and know how much it sucks to get stiffed. We went for breakfast and were seated immediately and our waitress came over immediately, handed is menus and said she would right back to take our drink order. 15 minutes later we were standing up to leave after waiting so long watching our waitress make multiple visits to other tables. Another waitress noticed and apologized for the wait and took our drink and food order. About two minutes later our Original waitress came over and asked if we were ready to order with a bit of an attitude. We informed her that the other waitress had already taken our order. Over a half hour goes by, our food still hasn't come and I'm getting ready to just leave, again. The first waitress comes over and says they were out of wheat bread and asked if white toast was fine, I said sure. A few minutes later she comes out with out food which was all cold except the toast, so it was apparent to me our food was waiting on her to ask about the toast. We eat and wait for the check, watching the waitress make repeated visits to other tables I finally asked another server for our check, paid and left. Start to finish we were in the diner for about an hour and a half and our waitress only stopped at our table twice, with other servers taking our order and bringing our check",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"This bar Louie is located in the financial district in Nashville. Yes! Nashville has a financial district. There are more upscale condos in the area and shopping.  I have been to a few bar Louie locations across the country PA,DC. Usually it's a bar /sport bar type atmosphere. I came on a Thursday night. Around 10pm the place was packed. They have indoor and outdoor seating. This location also had lounge areas for people lounge in like a club. The music here was very loud like a club.   Most of the people inside were 20-35 yr old. The girls were beautiful. But hey. It's the south. Sooo it doesn't surprise me! This bar Louie was fun. I never thought I would say that. No one was dancing. But if they had a dance floor I'm sure everyone would be dancing.   Out waiter was very nice and the manager came over 2 times to check on us. The manager even escorted us out opened the door and said have a great night.   Our food was hot when it got to the table. I ordered a chicken sandwich. It was really good.

"Here's the thing, I am not a big fan of corner store Chinese food at all, when it comes to Chinese or Asian food in general I can be very picky, with Pei Wei being my go to, but not in my neighborhood, in my neighborhood Superhouse is the go to.  Food is always good, a nice amount of food is given with your entree.  I usually get the chicken and broccoli, which so good and so are their chicken wings.  I highly suggest this place for Chinese food.  Best in West Philly hands down.  Here's a tip: Call ahead because it is ALWAYS crowded.  However, on the other hand sometimes you call and they won't put your food on until you get there, it all depends on who you get, just be very nice when you call and know what you want, and you'll have a better chance.  They also have funny hours.  I only notice the are open really late for dinner I guess.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
What a great little spot in the middle of a nice neighborhood. We got there just as they opened and had a drink and played some pool. They have a great beer selection and full bar.

"My ""Yelping style"" is to always try and remain objective when writing a review; even reviews for businesses I feel have room to improve or I don't particularly care for. This is the case for Salt N Pepper.  Working nearby, I decided to give them a try on a recent Saturday afternoon.  Salt N Pepper is an Indian / Pakistani / Halal restaurant that features a lot of traditional sounding dishes, to include several offerings of goat.  I opted for a to go order of a beef kabob plate with basmati rice.  Even though the restaurant was empty, I was told that it would be 15 minutes for my order.  So I think, ok, this is going to be prepared fresh from scratch.  I come back 15 minutes later and I see by Styrofoam container of basmati rice coming out of the microwave oven, which is not what I expected.  My plate of beef came out a minute later and I took my food back to my office.  There was a very sparse salad of lettuce, tomatoes and onions, along with some type of salad dressing I had never tasted before.  The beef was pretty good, but it was entirely too spicy.  I'm talking ""get a handkerchief for your runny nose"" spicy.  I was disappointed that I did not get any type of bread (pita or tortilla) with my meal.  The salad was not appealing and the microwaved rice, although quite edible, was a little bit of a turn-off.  The $13.00 price tag was pretty steep considering alternative lunch choices in the French Quarter.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very dated and could use a face lift, and I'm glad I got my meal to go.  In summary, Salt N Pepper needs to spruce up the dining room and perhaps reconsider some of their food prep techniques, especially that microwave oven.  So I stand by my 2 star review.  This is not a bad restaurant, but as the rating states, I've experienced better.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"First time in Philly, from Boston, and my family wanted Dim Sum. I asked a street vendor which dim sum in the Chinatown area is best. She pointed out to Ocean Harbor, so that's where we went. Coming in, we were seated right away (guessing we were lucky to come in before 10am). It gets extremely crowded with a line out the door by 10:45am.  -1* Service was lackluster, slow and did not meet my expectations. Maybe I'm just used to a quick and satisfying service dim sum in Boston. I noticed there -1* weren't any Tabasco sauce on the table, therefore I asked, and to my surprise, they did not have any.  -1* The food was oily, especially the vegetable green stalks. Turnip cakes were dense and mushy, shiu mai (apologies for any butchering) was oily and totally meat mystery worthy.  Two stars for their bathroom cleanliness; not amazing but good enough being in Chinatown. The other star for their open seating space.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"For some reason whenever I come here there is an issue. I believe I'm going to stop giving this place a chance because it's not worth the time, money, or brain power. Today I went in after trying to order online (which for some reason never seems to work). My order wasn't done yet so I sat and waited. After waiting I was called up and during my transaction I reached for a toothpick on the counter. The container holding them wasn't secure at all on the counter and toppled down, spilling toothpicks. The lady at the counter finished my transaction after her and I picked up the toothpicks on the counter. As I stated, there is always an issue when I come here so when I left and got to my car, I noticed food was missing from my order. So I had to turn around and come back in. There was about a 7 minute time lapse in between. When I returned to retrieve the rest of my order, the toothpicks were still on the floor. No one had made an effort to pick them up which I believe is a hazard. I'm making this post to alert people of the possible hazards in this restaurant as they are negligent on the regular basis.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

I've never experienced such terrible pizza.  From pulling up to the dingy restaurant...which looks like a trailer that somebody slid off of the back of a dumptruck....to the dark and dreary interior which looks like anyone over 4 feet tall would have trouble standing.  The two pizzas I got were about $50.00 and I wound up having to throw them out for the possums and raccoons to eat.  The sausage tasted like pepto-bismol.  The texture of the crust was something I never want to taste again.  A horrible experience all around.  Will never eat anything from this hole in the wall dump.  And to think they actually send out coupons....but are careful not to list prices of items.  Prices must fluctuate on the availability of meth in the nearby area....which is a ghetto.

My husband does not like spicy food and asked the waiter if the po-boy is spicy and she informed him no. Maybe she was new or forgot to mention the sauce is spicy but he was very upset due to how long we had waited to get in and get our food that he just ate off of my plate.

They were out of the beer that his cousin wanted. This was a Tuesday night for GOD SAKE! Who's is doing the ordering??? Then to top off our evening the appetizers and entrees came out cold. The crabcake appetizer would have been good if it was served hot!!! The salmon I had was like rubber. We spent a nice amount of money in there and really came out with total disappointment.

"Alright. Before I start this review, I'd like to state: I DID NOT EAT HERE. The reasons that I gave this place one star I are: 1. I have no choice and 2. The drink that I had (which I did not finish) was mediocre so I guess one star is suitable. My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place out. I mean, who doesn't love pizza?! So, we go to the bar and order a drink each. He had a bottled beer which is pretty hard to fuck up and I had a vodka whatever. It was super strong. I love my vodka, but I don't like my drink to be so strong that I become flammable after one sip. ANYWAY, before ordering food, I decide to go to the bathroom. I did my thing and proceeded to TRY to wash my hands. However I ran into two disturbing issues: 1. No sign saying ""employees must wash hands"" (now, I don't usually pay attention to this sign until I DON'T SEE IT. Then I start to get a little worried about the cleanliness of the establishment/food/employees) 2. There is NO SOAP in the softsoap brand dispenser. In fact, the top was off and thrown to the side. I decided to see if I could salvage some soap that might be at the bottom of the container (some soap is better than none). But alas! There is no soap at the bottom of the container and it was bone dry which told me that it has probably been like that for a while. At this point, I am contaminated with who knows what and drunk off of one sip of my vodka based drink. I got back to the bar and all that I can think of is the bartenders possible pee/poop particle ridden hands making my drink. I proceeded to throw up in my mouth and we booked it out of there.  I'm sure my life was spared by my decision to not eat the pizza.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I will never, ever, in my whole life, understand why people love this restaurant so much.  I walk by often and  see a lots of NJ plates using the valet service -so It's gotta be the tourists (AND my co-workers that live in the suburbs - they like Ralph's, but you should see what they eat for lunch every day if you know what I mean.)    I suspect that  the suburban folks are at a disadvantage by only having an Olive Garden to compare ""authentic"" Italian food to so Ralph's probably seems like some freaky cheese covered upgrade.  Anyway, back to Ralph's, sure, it's been there for over a hundred years, the decor is cute on the first floor, reminding one of the ""olden days"".  Sure, the service is cheeky if not just a little snarky, but the food is downright terrible.   Okay. it's edible, but not edible in a good way.   The last time I was there was for a wedding rehearsal dinner and no one finished their entrees & when asked by the waitress if anyone wanted it wrapped up to take home - it was a unanimous, ""No.""  This was from roughly around, oh, 100 people.

"I just attempted to have a meal at The Little Greek Deli. It was my first attempt and certainly my last. I think this dialogue between me and the owner/employee represents my experience quite accurately.   ""Excuse me."" I said as the guy who had taken our orders walked into the room. ""Does this salad cost more than his gyro?"" I pointed across the table to my boyfriend's plate. On it was a gyro and a fresh side salad.  ""No, the salad is $7.75 and the gyro is $8.50."" He responded, grinning awkwardly.  ""This salad is only slightly larger than the side salad that came with his gyro. How can...""  ""I don't make the prices, my step mom does."" He said, still grinning.   ""I don't understand how this salad can cost as much as his entire plate."" I said, inquisitively.  ""Well, I don't know what to tell ya."" He retorted flippantly.  ""Okay,"" I said, realizing he wasn't willing to help me find a solution. ""Can I return this then?"" ""Yeah. I'll get these out of your way."" He said bitterly, snatching up my salad and my boyfriend's plate, off of which he was still eating.   Unexpectedly finding ourselves seated around a bare table top, my boyfriend and I look at each other, kind of shocked. He was planning to eat and pay for his gyro of which he had only taken a couple bites. We stand up and walk out. A shrill voice chases us across the lawn, ""Don't ever come back here,"" she screams. I'm assuming this voice belongs to the ""step mom"" that the presumed step son had mentioned earlier. ""There are starving children all over the world, you bitch."" She shouts, making sure her anger reaches us as we hop in our van.   Good-bye Reno. I bet that will be the last time we pull off the highway to ""find a good place to eat in Reno.""

"Anthony's is one of those places where I know what I'm going to order when I walk in.  Once, I strayed from my tried and true favorite, and I was disappointed.   Two of us split the salad (cold iceberg and romaine, topped with chickpeas, onions, olives, a hard-boiled egg, and red wine vinaigrette) and the traditional pizza. It's delicious. I love the crust -- it's thin but not too thin, and perfectly crisp. The cheese is bubbly and browned, and the sauce is just perfect. They have signs up, and it's part of their brand that the pizza is ""well-done"", and on my first visit, I was a little too well-done. As in, burned. They brought it to us and promised a second pizza before we even asked. We snacked on the less-burned side of the overcooked pizza and ended up taking most of the other one home.   Once, for lunch, I tried the cauliflower pizza. It was too intriguing to pass up, but it was also too heavy and oily to enjoy. So, I stick to my favorite. If I'm ever feeling brave enough, I may try the eggplant pizza or white pizza. But I'd rather go someplace else for toppings and stick with the plain cheese here.   They have drink specials (Peroni on Mondays and Tuesdays, and martinis on Wednesday) and tons of televisions on every wall.

Outside of those two things I always end up leaving with a belly full of good food and I'm not a breakfast water. And I always end up leaving a few sweet treats too.   Update: I docked a star because today (6/25) there weren't that many people in and all of the waitresses were huddled around the hostess stand. That resulted in a 10 minute wait.

It's like having two professional degrees....you end up being mediocre at both.    The food:  Overpriced for what it is.  The rice is sticky and mealy, which makes eating raw fish on top of it unpleasant.  They did have fast service which is a minor plus.  The quality of the fish was so-so.  My unagi was nice (but I think I've never had bad eel at any sushi restaurant), but my spicy tuna roll was just plain gross.

"After eating here several times now I can confirm it's probably my favorite Mexican eatery in Santa Barbara. The first time I was completely unimpressed because all I ordered was the Gordita de Frijol.   But most of the dishes are really good. The handmade tortillas and queso are must-tries. My favorites are #7 tri tip and #16 marinated pork with pasilla pepper and cheese. And if you see a tamalito on the specials board, it is one of the best dishes I've eaten in town. It's this adorable and tender tamale-like gift full of chicken and spices that work.  Horchata is good and the salsas including pico de gallo are not bad, though I find the dishes usually so flavorful they are hardly needed.   It's true the restaurant is not the most clean but I haven't expected that of this type of establishment. Also I think for what you get, quality made-to-order dishes, the prices are fair. Tacos for $2.50 each and larger plates for $6.50 with three handmade tortillas isn't extreme in Santa Barbara.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

The menu is pretty massive, offering a wide variety of Chinese and Japanese items including stuff like Edamame, Maki Rolls, Teriyaki, etc. The food has been superior and the girls that run the place are very nice and work fast.   Many good veggie options including vegetarian spring rolls, dumplings, maki and other tasties (as well as what you'd expect with meat like General Tso, Sushi, Sweet & Sour Chicken, etc.).  There are about a half-dozen tables but the decor is austere to say the least - better to order take-out.  -----Update 5/7/08-----  I haven't been thrilled with my last few orders of maki rolls as they've been generally sloppy and not well put together. Not sure why. We have stopped ordering the rolls for this reason but are still very happy with the Chinese entrees, dumplings, edamame, etc. The girls have apparently noticed and now ask ""no rolls tonight?"" when we come in but the rolls were not good for probably 3 orders before we gave up on them.

"My wonderful boyfriend posted a review that has been since removed by Yelp about his experience at this Cecil Whittakers (and pretty much all Cecil Whittakers, for that matter) that was essentially a copy and paste of his Imo's review, which served as a literary illustration of the one-noted-ness (a word!) of these two St. Louis-style pizza chains. I thought this was hilarious, but Yelp removed the review for not being original. As such, since I have not provided a review for Cecil Whittaker's yet agree with each and every word of the review based upon a lifetime of being forced to eat Cecil Whittaker's because my family loves it, here goes:  ""St. Louis does a lot of things right.  Like donuts!  Pizza, however, is not one of them.  This stuff is a disgusting abomination that I'm sure is served on Hell's Buffet.  ""Honey, look, they have PIZZA!  This won't be so bad after all!"" ""Oh, know...what's that?  Oh my goodness, it's provel!"" ""Ah, St. Louis style pizza!  My God, why have thou forsaken me!""  There's a reason provel cheese and St. Louis style pizza do not exist outside of the metro area, and that is because both are awful Frankensteinian creations.  Maybe St. Louis just decided it needed its own type of pizza and the locals feel like they're betraying the motherland by speaking truthfully, but the stuff is just not good.  I'm not even sure I can call it pizza.""  The only redeeming quality of Cecil Whittaker's is decent salad (although Imo's dressing is soooo much better).

"I've been itching to try this place out for a while now, and I'm so excited that I was finally able to! A few friends and I came here last weekend to enjoy a bottle of wine and desert.   The Vibes: This restaurant is tucked away in Old Boise in the same location where the original District Coffee House was located before it moved to 10th and Bannock. The interior has a charming, romantic, and rustic feel to it. There are petit stringed lights lining all of the windows, exposed stone walls, granite tables, and simple decor. Classy, slightly swanky, and the perfect place to go on a date or split a bottle of wine with your friends.  The Food: We split a bottle of Columbia Valley Cabernet. This bottle was lovely--dry, bold, and just a little bit fruity. Along with this, we ordered a Creme Brulee. This dessert was fabulous--creamy, rich, sweet, and the top of it has an ever-so-thin layer of crystalized caramel heaven. We also were treated to a potato croquette appetizer, and this was delicious! The croquettes were crispy on the outside while providing that soft ""sink your teeth into it"" center, and came with a lovely dipping sauce.   The Service: We had a wonderful server. Josh took care of us and went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and enjoying ourselves. He was fun to talk to, but also very knowledgeable about the menu, wines, and restaurant as a whole.  Overall: Rad atmosphere, rockin' service, good wine, and tasty food. 5/5, highly recommend! I will be back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I emailed corporate about a month ago in regards to the level of dust, dirt and filth visible to the customers.  I even offered to share some photos that I took. I felt somewhat brushed off when they weren't even interested in them.  They stated that my concerns would be directed to the appropriate person to get things corrected. This morning we decided to stop and give this location another chance.  It's been about a month and Sadly all the same issues were still visible and not cleaned up at all.

"We visited this Vietnamese restaurant for a couple time now. The first time we walked in here, an older Asian waiter was by the door, we told him we needed a table for two. He grabbed some menu from the counter, then walked away without saying anything to us. We thought that was kind of rude. We ordered a couple bowls of noodle, thought they were okay. A lady came by while we were having our noodles to check if things were fine, she was nice.   We came back again for lunch today. The same older Asian guy was by the door, I told him how many people we had. He grabbed the menu, walked away from us. So we followed him assuming that he was going to take us to our table. But no! He took us to walk one round of the restaurant then walked into the kitchen without saying anything to us. That's beyond rude!!! Then a younger waiter saw us and seated us instead. But the whole experience has ruined our appetite. The noodle my husband ordered was undercooked and broth was watery and flavorless, and the beef in my noodle was fatty and grisly, I didn't eat any of them.   As long as that rude waiter is working there, we will not ever step foot into this restaurant again. I will give my business to the next door Taiwanese restaurant which has much better food and definitely better service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Lets start out with the pros - The sake was excellent! I feel like more Thai restaurants should take their lead and serve hot sake.  The cons - We ordered the calamari (which was just meh... all the breading would fall off if you looked at it the wrong way) The sweet and spicy sauce was nice. I ordered the crunchy chicken pad thai and all the sauce was on the bottom and the meat tasted like it was reheated from the night before.  I guess I am just spoiled from the freshness that Sukho Thai consistently delivers time and time again.  Second there were no fresh bean sprouts or lime so kinda disappointing there.

"I rarely eat Chinese food. It's not that I don't like it, I just don't crave it. On a whim one Thursday night, I was in the mood for egg drop soup and some stir fried veggies. I called in the order and was pleased to see a full lot and others waiting for pick-up.   It's hard to say that they knocked it out of the park because in my opinion, unless you are in Chinatown in NYC or San Fran, Chinese food is just basically the same-ish and mediocre-ish.   I had the mixed veggies with tofu. I should have specified that I prefer my tofu steamed and not fried, as it gets rubbery. The soup was fine. My friend's hot and sour soup looked better. He also had some dumplings that he said were good (I'm not a fan, so I skipped them).  I'm not sure if they offer chopsticks because I forgot to ask. I do know that they do not add complimentary fortune cookies....which left me empty inside because I needed to read a corny saying about ""love hard and laugh often""....I'll return when the mood for Chinese food strikes again, and I'll be sure to ask for both sticks and a cookie.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"We had dinner at Parc recently, and the experience was like many others I've had there - incredibly delightful! We shared everything - we had two appetizers, two main courses (Parc offered to split the fish dish for sharing), and two desserts - all were exceptional. Our meal began with the Crab and Avocado - I lived in Maryland for over 30 years and am very discerning when it comes to crab - this crab rillette was succulent, with a fresh delicious taste. The next appetizer was the Roasted Beet and Carrot salad - layered with a goat cheese mousse, avocado and walnuts....I savored the taste with my eyes closed. Yes, it was that good.  The main dishes we shared were the Mediterranean Sea Bass and Ricotta Ravioli (the ravioli was listed under salads, but was an exemplary side dish with the fish). The fish was so moist with a mouth watering tapenade, roasted peppers and beans. The raviolis were light, with a creamy ricotta filling, smothered in a marinara sauce. I didn't think the meal could get any better - but it did - the desserts were extraordinary. I'll be dreaming about the Profiteroles for several weeks - with the flakiest pastry, richest vanilla bean ice cream and decadent bittersweet chocolate drizzle, they were some of the finest I've had. The Apple Tart, a luscious pastry filled with caramelized apples and topped with ice cream, was a great ending to a very memorable dining experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"this place is warm, cozy, welcoming...all that good stuff.  i was in town for six months for work and, as i sit in my sweltering echo park summer sublet, i'm feeling nostalgic for cold, rainy february nights at the upperline.    as i was leaving town back in the beginning of june, word just got out that the chef, ken smith, was retiring his apron at the end of july and joining the seminary.  as of today it seems a replacement has yet to be found.    knowing that, most of the reviews up now may be out-of-date very soon.  but pretending the titanic is just pulling in to port for a brief retool, i've been around the menu a bit and the stand outs for me were:  oysters st. claude - plump ones fried up with a garlic sauce topper (last time i was here was in may '10...they were p&j oysters.  p&j is no more, thanks to the gulf oil spill.  is this review now more ""memorium"" than recommendations for future visits?  god, i hope not...)  the roast duck with garlic port sauce (served with the best mashed sweet potatoes i've ever eaten - topped with candied pecans).  the most tender, moist, flavorful duck i've ever had too while we're on the hyperbole tip.  true, i don't order duck everywhere i go, but i've ordered this duck several times now and never had a regret about it.  honey-pecan bread pudding with toffee sauce (holy hell, what else is there to say about that?!)  have a glass of port while you're at it.  you've earned it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"After hearing so much about this place, we just had to stop in during our recent trip to Nashville. On a Wednesday morning around 11am, the wait was close to 30 minutes. We didn't mind since we were expecting pancake greatness.  We ordered banana nut cakes and eggs/toast with a side order of chocolate chip pancakes. Overall, the pancakes were fine, but nothing to write home about. The banana nut came with about 5 pancakes through they were quite small and thin and not very filling. The chocolate chip just had a few mini chips on top, but none inside. The waitress had to return back to the table twice after me asking to order a Diet Coke because she kept forgetting my drink order. When I got it, it tasted a little funny.

"Major disappointment. If it were not for #CareyKStrong, I would have given them a 2 Star rating.   I came for breakfast want to show my support for the #CareyKStrong movement in my new neighborhood. In my opinion, breakfast is one of the hardest meals to screw-up, but Joe K's managed to do it.  I love a hearty breakfast. Having a big breakfast, I can usually skip lunch and have an early dinner. The morning of my visit, I ordered the, Hungry Man Breakfast . I had my choice of meats, I choose, bacon. It came with two eggs, I had mine fried hard with the yolks broken. For my potatoes, I requested my Hash Browns be done extra crispy and instead of toast, I paid the uncharge for $ sized pancakes.   Positives of the entree; the pancakes were full sized, not what a city man would call $ sized and they were fluffy and good flavor. My eggs were also done as I requested and none of the food was overly seasoned with salt or pepper. Also, the coffee was very good and the servers made sure my cup was always full.   The negatives are, cold, chewy and twisted bacon. I mean, ice cold. I know a lot of diners prepare bacon in advance to make things easier and faster, but this bacon tasted as if it were from the day before. My Hash Browns were not extra crispy, they were not even semi crisp. They too, were cold like the potatoes you'd get on a buffet line.   The service was attentive and they were all wearing masking. The tables were spaced for social distancing, but they did not skip booths, so those dining in a booth were right next to each other.   I'll give them another try, because I've heard the lunches are very good. I not only want to support a local diner, but I want to support the #CareyKStrong fundraiser as well.

"I was happy to see a restaurant open in the 101 Bridge street location. The promise of upscale Mexican made me think of my experiences at Frontera Grill and Topolobampo in Chicago. Unfortunately, what was delivered this Friday night was closer to Taco Bell with a liquor license.  When I called to make a reservation, I inquired about corkage. They said no and we offer margaritas - eerr OK - that should have been the first clue.  When our party of 5 friends was seated in the dining room past the crowded bar, the first thing that we were asked is how many pitchers of margaritas we would like. That should have been clue #2. We ordered a pitcher at $50, which came with an up-sell for triple with the promise of a smooth yet powerful margarita. I was thinking I would get to enjoy a high quality margarita like the one at Distrito but what was delivered was a watered down margarita made from a ready-made mix.  We ordered some appetizers which were not bad and the guacamole actually seemed freshly made. The cactus salad was not bad either.   Our entrees were Bistek which was OK, Pulpo (octopus) was well cooked but served in a huge pile of bell peppers as were the shrimp, which were tiny and overcooked.   The most disappointing dish was the mole poblano, which lacked the characteristic complexity and deep layers of flavors. Unfortunately, this version had monotone flavors and was sweet and almost reminded us of nutella (which I like, but not as a mole negro).  Service is friendly but slow and they really need to stop with the up-sell on the margaritas as it just gives the wrong impression,   By the end of the night, we had $100 in watered down margaritas and food which was disappointing at any price. At this point I prefer their other taqueria in Norristown which serves some great tacos including a barbacoa.  Hope they can get their act together soon as we can really use a nice restaurant in Phoenixville.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"It all starts at the door... The experience that is. Which is where this review of Kayne Prime begins. We arrived a little behind the reservation which was conveyed to wait staff 30 min before our arrival we were told it was not an issue . Once we arrived to Kayne Prime we were forced to valet our car which is never a good thing, the customer should have a choice. To add to it, the valet company clealry states they have no responsibility for anything which is unnerving considering you have no choice.      Upon entering Kayne Prime we noticed that it was fairly busy for a tuesday, the wait staff explained our table would be ready soon and to wait at the bar which was clearly full. We opted to wait by the host stand until our table was ready. In the ten minutes it took for our table to be ready we noticed the red chandelier was fairly dusty, enough to have cobb webs and the entry rugs had a soured smell to them. Quite noticeable to someone invested in the service industry. Once finally seated we were greeted by the server assistant Jason approximately 5 minutes after being seated. He only took the water order and said Joel our sever would be around soon. 10 minutes and a drink order later Joel arrived to begin the pacing of the meal. He explained specials and drinks and then took our app order.       We ordered the popcorn buttered lobster. Sounded pretty good. It took close to 40 min to recieve our lobster app after being seated for 15 minutes. The app itself was mediocre.. The lobster was good and prepared well but was confused and masked by the popcorn (gimmick much like the cotton candy on bacon, what is this a carnival ?) The butter that was drizzled was broken and too salty. Needed something else. Dish was lacking overall, not to mention hardly enough for 2.      Next was the Caesar salad. From ordering to table it took 30 min. When we recieved it, it was room temp, plate was not cold at all. There was about a half a head of romaine in full stock on plate. The dressing was sweet and lacked that anchovy or parmesan punch expected from a caesar salad. The crouton had a nice crunch but was bland. Parmesan was good yet not shredded. Carmelized Olives? were pretty good addition. Overall not worth $14.      1 hour and 30 minutes later and still no entree. I used this opportunity to visit mens room. Was slightly messy, had hand towels on floor in stall and by sink. There is also a room for private parties right by the restroom which clearly needed sweeping as it is in clear view of every guest passing by to reach the bathroom.       I returned to the table and we waited another 15 min for food entrees to arrive, during which I finished my beer and Jason swooped by and grabbed my glass but didnt  ask if I needed another, which I did... I was starving! 3 minutes later he returned and obliged my request.      Finally about another 20 min after returning to table the food arrived. The 6oz wygu filet was ordered medium but came out mid well, borderline well done. The guest did not complain due to being hungry and not wanting to wait. Steak was room temp and had good texture and flavor. It was a wonderful cut and was tender. Too bad it wasnt hot at all.        10oz wagyu filet was also ordered medium but came out room temp and rare. Was good cut of meat, had good flavor and texture. Unfortunately the $60 piece of meat was sent back to be cooked up. Unforgiveable in a high end steakhouse. This is your flagship. It represents your brand. Cookups are NO GOOD.       We ordered two sides. Potato Aligot and Cream Corn brulee. Potato Aligot had good flavor but was a mess. So runny it could be soup, a stringy glue consistency. Aligot is Mashed Potatoes blended with cheese and some garlic. This was soup. Not impressed. Texture made eating it unpleasurable which is a shame as the flavor is there.      Creme Corn Brulee also had good flavor but was watery, lacked creme and the heat from jalapeno. Left much to be desired. The carmelized sugar topping was a little too much as it was so sweet. If there was a creamier corn and more heat it might have worked.      Although we sent a 10oz wagyu filet back we did not see a manager at all. They never approached the table at all until we were done 2hrs later. She asked how server Joel did to which we replied he did good, we tipped him 20%. Im not blaming the server because he is stuck between the kitchen, the guest, and the overpriced meal. All of which ties the servers hands. What could they tell the guest to make them feel better? Nothing, other than ""the manager will be by shortly!"". Thats the managers job! The manager just said have a goodnight and left. She never acknowledged the issues with the meal, the long wait for said meal, nor did she even introduce herself. Strange considering steakhouses far under this place in price and caliber would offer the decency of introducing themselves, especially a manager! Bill was $215.17 and the tip was $40.

Not good. The Hercules bowl was a very small portion sized and didn't taste good. There were some random spinach leaves and grape tomatoes thrown on the side with no dressing that didn't work with the rest of the bowl. The fruit on the side was again too small of a portion and didn't taste ripe.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I have wanted to try this place since it opened as I am always searching for new ""Burger"" places that are a little on the gourmet side.  I wasnt too concerned about the price, as more of the quality.  My wife had the regular burger with fries and I had the Cowboy with onion rings.  We ordered lemonade to wash it all down and while being hot, I sucked mine down rather quickly.  Waitress walked by 5 times and several of those, as she walked by, she looked at the table and i was in hopes of getting a refill. NOPE.  I had to ask another server for a refill which she quickly brought.  Food arrived and looked appetizing, and was ready to dig in.  3 onions rings where the batter which would literally fall apart when you took a bite.  the spicy ranch cup was only about 1"" round to dip a 3"" onion ring, lame.  Burger was decent but lacked seasoning and hardly any ""maybe a dollop"" of BBQ sauce when this is a ""Cowboy"" burger, nothing else but meat, cheese, onion straws and some bacon, rather dry and flavorless.  Wife couldnt even eat her burger as tasted like eating air.  Fries tasted old and like they had freezer burn.  On the other hand, decor was nice, good selection of beer and whiskey and manager did a lot of walking around not checking on the guests to see if ""everything"" was ok.  First and last time, was really hoping for a new spot to eat downtown.  I'm not a food, but if I am going to spend $30 for two burgers and a fountain drink, I expect more.  Chubbies is less than half the price and twice as good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Not a big deal until my most recent visit. The young girl waiting tonight seemed a bit awkward, maybe she was new. Had to ask for a fork since im no good with chopsticks. Then i sat and waited five minutes or more for the fork to be delivered. Near the end of my meal another waitress showed up and the two girls started gossiping about someone else who worked there. Again, i found myself waiting for a box, the check and the check and my card to be returned. The girl waiting on me was far too focused on gossiping than she was in waiting on the customer.

We always enjoyed our Breakfast and I was excited when last week I finally had enough points on my Brunchies card to get a free breakfast,($10.00).

Today I advised the same male cashier,(two other female waitresses were at the register) that I should get my discount. I was advised I did not have the receipt needed and there was nothing they can do. My husband and I felt like , ""we just needed to pay,and leave"".

"This used to be my fav spot to get a super quick pho bo or delicious grilled pork chop on rice. We used to eat there at least once every few months and ordered a ton of foods to go. It was fast service, affordable, and just the right 4-star rating.   Recently, the ownership must have changed hands or the chefs changed, the whole vibe was different when we came in last Sunday. The service took 20 mins to get our pho (which is pretty much unacceptable in Vietnamese restaurant for foods to come out. Especially pho since everything already cooked/sliced, just a matter of assembling it on a bowl).  We ordered our usual beef pho dac biet and grilled pork chop on broken rice and the grilled meat came out sliced and not on the bone. Pho was watered down. They didn't have bean sprouts with our pho, and the soup spoon was also out. Everything about a solid vietnamese experience was not there, not fast and not delicious, and the reason why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because it's still cheap.

"Great environment and great food. What more can you want? 5 Star Burgers has a range of gourmet-style burgers that is sure to appease the palate of almost every customer. (I apologize beforehand if you somehow prove to be the exception :)) Ranging from the more traditional to a little bit different (bison anyone?), this place really knows how to play with different flavors and find things that you wouldn't normally think go together but somehow magically work. I haven't tried everything on their menu (unfortunately), but the Green Chile Chicken Breast was pretty amazing in flavor and absolutely moist, something that other places have a tendency to mess up.   If you want to try more of a variety of foods or are in need of a midday snack (or just kinda poor, like me), come during Happy Hour where they serve a variety of sliders for pretty discounted prices. Granted, I don't think the quality of foods served during this time is as good as their food served during normal hours, but it's still satisfying and enjoyable.   Absolutely try this place out.

"We went to Husk in Nashville last night for a special dinner with friends while on vacation. We had been to the original in Charleston a few years back  when it was new and fresh.   This one while in a gorgeous old home seemed like they were trying way too hard to be a bit too pretentious.   We got there early for a 7:45 dinner and were told that the small bar downstairs was filled and we would have to wait on the front porch. As it turned out the bar was very large with many seats available- they just didn't offer them to us. We had a drink on the porch and the sassy girl at the front desk said they were holding the bar seats for ""other reserved customers "". I guess her snotty demeanor turned me off from the very start.   The food is well prepared and tasty. I had the meat () and my husband the chic which he loved. We all had starters and shared one dessert  and  2 bottles of house priced wine. The best part for me was the chocolate cake. The service is attentive- so much information is given on the food preparation it makes your head spin. If you are a new foodie with deep pockets this is the place for you.  Our bill ended up being well over 400.$ for 4 people. It was a lovely experience- minus the uppity girl up front,but I certainly wouldn't return.

At around 10:00-10:30, the restaurant was not crowded at all. This restaurant is a part of a larger plaza so the parking was super fantastic.  The moment I stepped into the IHOP, I was met with bright smiles and warm greetings. The overall atmosphere and attitude of the waiter and waitresses here are so pleasant, but maybe a little too pleasant. At times, the waitress was a bit too over bearing, but her friendliness allowed me to over look this small factor. The people in the restaurant were definitely nice, but the actual restaurant and infrastructure could have used more work.  Now for the nasty critiquing part....

It then took a while for the burger to come out...and they even forgot about my order/giving it to me. I had to ask after 20 minutes if it was even cooking.

Honestly, if my friend and I hadn't been SO HUNGRY, I doubt we would have liked it at all.

Service was outstanding a bit pricey for Italian. If not for the price and selection probably 4 stars but for what they offer very good Italian food.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"First, my husband and I are both from border towns (El Paso and Nogales) so we are pretty picky about our Mexican food. We moved to Vail about 2 months ago and have been trying out the food in the area.  We decided to try Rancho Rustico and we are so happy we did! First, the chips and salsa was pretty good. Salsa was a little bit on the sweet side for me but the chips were awesome. My husband always orders Chile Colorado or Chile con Carne where ever we go and he loooved it here! It had tender meat and a rich, flavorful red sauce. Delish! Plus, everyone knows the true measure of a good Mexican restaurant is their beans and rice and this place does not disappoint. Beans and rice were on point! I ordered the 2 entree meal with a Chile relleno and an enchilada. The Chile relleno was really good. The sauce on the enchilada wasn't that great but that's OK.  So, if you live in the area this place is a must try!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
Tried Corkys again last night.  There were two customers in the restaurant and it still took forever to get a Pig Pen Salad and a barbecue sandwich.  The portions were smaller and with two drinks the total was $34.  The value is just not there.  I do not plan to go back. There are many other better values and choices.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I ordered a Thom Kha Hot Pot for take-out, which is the large size of the soup and is supposed to serve 4 people. I also ordered a side of sticky rice. For $24 before tip I got a small container of soup, maybe 24 oz and the tiniest packet of sticky rice. So they upcharged me to $20 for a large soup and I can only assume gave me the same portion that they would give someone who paid $14 for a regular size. I wanted to like this place because it's nearby, and the soup is good. It tastes like you would expect a Thom Kha to taste. But I feel disappointed and ripped off.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Her attitude is disgusting at its finest. Once she handed us our food, she never comes back to check on us.

I ended up getting a chocolate donut while my friends got two. They cashier ended up giving us free donuts as the store was closing, so we only paid for half if the donuts we actually bought.

"I saw this place on the Diners, Drive-in's and Dives page of the FN website and wanted to see for myself.  I have to say, I was dissapointed.  The rolls brought to the table before the meal were cold and seemed like they've seen better days.  I ordered roast chicken which came with stuffing, and cranberry sauce and gravy and got mashed potatoes on the side.  The stuffing, potatoes, gravy and cranberry sauce, I'm convinced, all came from either a box or a can.  The chicken, I'll admit, was cooked pretty nicely, though it was a bit bland.  For dessert, I tried the ""Justly Famous"" Jewish Apple Cake.  I'm thinking the only thing famous about it might be the name on the box that it also seems to have come from.  I wasn't a fan (in case you couldn't tell).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
Coldcuts are cut fresh for the sandwich and the sandwiches are made VERY well. I ordered a standard ham sandwich and it was as good as any I have had in NJ  The store itself is the weakest part of this deli. It is randomly put together and has an off-putting atmosphere. It is in a nice strip mall and has a lot if potential but there is just random stuff all over the place including a weak attempt at a seating area.   I do want to reiterate that the food was excellent and probably would get 4.5 stars if they improved the atmosphere.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"If I came here for the oysters and bourbon only I might have blindly given this place 5 stars.  We made a dinner reservation and did not wait long to be seated. The ambiance and decor wish to exude high class dining. I felt a little undressed, but I'm a tourist here. The oysters with caviar are excellent. I should have made that my meal. The trio of baked oysters: Rockefeller, Bienville, Fonseca were not for me. There was a lot of breading and additives that didn't help the taste. I scraped off as much as I could.  The oyster shooters were clever. I also enjoyed a house salad and the ribeye which sat on a bed of fries that got soggy. I did like that the food server was very knowledgeable and excited to describe how the menu items were prepared. It is odd for the separation of duties of the drink and food servers. Maybe this is a method to expedite service, but I felt that we still waited a long time for our food.  Overall the food is good but not exceptional.

"We have been looking for a special breakfast restaurant to go to in Palm Harbor for some time now. Well, unfortunately, after eating at Tiffany's Family Restaurant,  the search continues.   The restaurant has a nice feel and homey decor when you walk in the door but it's all downhill from there. We ordered the Traditional Eggs Benedict and Blackstone Benedict plus an order of French Toast to split between us. The poached eggs were undercooked and runny. They were pretty skimpy with the hollandaise which was pretty thin. The homefries were not hot and had no flavor. Worst of all was the French Toast which had barely been dipped in egg and on pretty thin bread for $7.00 an order!!  We sent the French Toast back (much to thr dismay of our server.  There was no way I was paying 7 bucks for that!! The service was average. She  never came back to check on us after bringing our food. I had to ask her for an extra plate 3 times. By the way, it wasn't very busy either. We didn't get any apologies for the french toast or any inquires as to how to make it better. Just a frown. Her mood lightened up slightly as she handed us the check.I'm sure in order to get a halfway decent tip. (We tipped 20%).

"Tacoson Authentic Mexican Grill is one of my favorite no frills authentic Mexican restaurants by the Hard Rock Casino in East Tampa! Although the interior decor is pretty plain and nothing fancy, there is lots of Mexican wall art and great Mexican food to make up for it!   You have to place your order at the register and the staff brings the food to your table! Tacoson has tacos, burritos, Quesadillas, ceviche, Mexican sandwiches, tostadas, flautas, chimichangas, nachos, and taco salad with your choice of steak, chicken, shredded beef, grilled pork, shredded pork, pork rinds in green salsa, beef tongue, and Mexican style zucchini God the vegetarians.   The Panzon Burrito with pulled pork came with black beans, sour cream, rice, sour cream Monterrey jack cheese, and tons of veggies. Combined with 4 house made dark green, light green, dark red, and light red hot sauces, the flavor was amazing! The Burrito is a pretty big size but the burritos at Taco Bus and Moe's are bigger than this burrito but the ingredients of this Burrito makes up for it! 9/10   The Bistec Ranchero, is the special of the day on Fridays, and comes with grilled steak, onions, peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, rice, beans, and tortillas. The steak was tender, we'll Marinated, not chewy, and not overcooked. The specials of the day ate the best value and give you a ton of food if you're hungry! This dish is very tasty and will leave you totally full or is enough for 2 modest meals if you're trying not to eat too much. 9/10   If you're in the East Tampa area, near the Hard Rock Casino, and in the mood for some good authentic no frills Mexican food, I highly recommend you visit Tacoson Authentic Mexican Grill!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I've been wanting to check out this place for a while. Walking in it is very peculiarly decorated, it is adorably cute. the best way I can describe it is a quaint coffee shop with a menu for lunch and dinner and an array of desserts. I got the Portobello hash with added grill chicken. It was a mix of fried potatoes, onions, portobello mushrooms and chicken, with two eggs over easy and a side salad. The eggs were good, they were perfectly cooked. However I feel as though the food could have used a little bit more of seasoning. It was kind of bland and blah. My dessert  became the savior- I got the peanut butter brownie cookie. The peanut butter was a nice creamy consistency, not overbearing or oversweet.

"We're from out of town and always look for a more local place to eat. Hampton Station had good reviews so thought we'd give it a shot for some pizza. Had read somewhere that kids weren't allowed but when we called for more info, we were told it wouldn't be a problem to bring our 13 year old. The restaurant/bar appears to be in an old gas station with patio and indoor seating. Two tables were filled outside and I was hearing quite a bit of language from both before I'd really even gotten all the way out of the car. We decided to check inside and initially found it better but then the language picked up there as well. We moved to a table outside away from the others and it was ok so we placed an order.   The menu is somewhat limited... Pizza, calzones, and wings. If you don't want alcohol, you're limited to cans of Coke, Diet Coke, or Sprite... No teas.  Bartender/waitress was very friendly but admitted to having an off day. Our pizza came out wrong and she apologized and put in another order for the part of the pizza we were missing. In the meantime, we waited another 10-15 minutes for the correction and heard even more colorful language playing through the speakers. We were very thankful our daughter was engrossed in her phone and had earbuds in or we would have left before the rest of the order was finished.   Gave 2 stars for friendly waitress and good pizza. However, it's not a place I would go back to due to environment and limited menu and drink options.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"My wife and I have been trying to like this place since the first week that it opened with results I would call 2 or 3 star at best.  Tonight, the night before Thanksgiving we had some choices and thought lets give it one more try.  Well thank you Social Gastro Pub for making our future decision simple.  We will not return!  Here it the recap:  We arrive to a 3/4 empty dinning room at approximately 6:45 PM with only three servers on staff (see day before Thanksgiving!).   Our server was nice enough to let us know he would be right with us which is great, we understand the industry.  This turned bad when he didn't return for 10 minutes.  However their was a glimmer of hope that this was just a momentary glitch when the host stopped by to see if we had been greeted.  We explained the situation and she happily took our drink order.  Then prior to the drinks being delivered our server finally returned to take our drink order and we shared with him that the host had taken it so all was good.  He immediately jumped to asking if we were ready to order our dinner and while we declined to order our entree prior to our adult beverages we did opt for the Bleu Chips.  They took 20 plus minutes to get to the table but were worth the wait, delicious.  When our server delivered the appetizer he again asked about our ordering of entrees.  My wife ordered the Stuffed Peppers ($13.50) and I ordered the Andria's Filet Med Rare ($32).  Unfortunately this is when bad went to worse. Our entrees took 45 to 50 minutes to reach the table.  Let's cover the Stuffed Pepper first.  It was slightly undercooked and a little charred on one of the ends.  My wife has had it several times in the past and it has never been the same so not the end of the world.  The stuffing was good, pepper undercooked.  Now the reason for 1 Star for service and the Andria's Filet.    I was surprised/disappointed to find the Filet was bacon wrapped, which for anyone that knows anything about butchering, it bacon wrapped for a reason and I would not have ordered it.  However I peeled off the bacon and gave it a shot.  My first taste was that of something burnt.  I figured this was from the bacon and gave it another shot and boom, more burnt!  I flipped the steak and guess what?  The cook burnt the steak and tried to hide it.  Sorry, you can hide the look of a burnt steak but not the taste.  About this time the server came back and to inquire into how we were enjoying our meal.  I showed him the burnt steak which he strangely tried to evaluate whether I was correct in my assessment by looking at it from different angles.  After a moment he offered to take it back to the Sous Chef that shared had just arrived.  I'm not sure what time they close but a Sous Chef arriving for his shift after 7:00 PM seems a little strange but I digress.  Anyway, back to the point, after several minutes, enough for me to get through some of the sides, he offered to take my plate away and that the steak would be taken off my bill.  Fare enough.  Own up to the failure and all is good, mistakes happen and they were obviously not prepared so we will move on, right?  Unfortunately the management of the of Social Gastro Pub's operational philosophy lacks even the basic levels of hospitality. The server comes back to the table to share with me that the Sous Chef wanted to explain to me that steaks are cooked on an open flame and can char.  No kidding, an open flame can char a steak, news flash!  Nothing like a server trying to educate a guest as to why they were wrong in not liking there meal.  That is the kind of arrogance that just makes you want to give them your money, right!  They, the icing on the preverbal cake.  The manager (who was quick to make sure that we knew she was the owners ""significant other"" when I asked for his contact information) brings the check with a 50% discount for the steak!  She, with a straight face mind you, explains that I had eaten half of the steak and most of the sides.  I'm not making this up folks.  I had three bad bites of a burnt filet, some green beans and some mash potatoes for $16!  Insult to injury! I want to be clear, it is not about the money.  My wife and I are fortunate.  What motivates this review is the blatant lack of hospitality and the insulting continuous attempt to educate a dissatisfied guest why they should not be.  I have never spoken to the owner, I'm sure he is a sound businessman.  However, I would offer this bit of advise from someone that wanted to be a fan, who has spent allot of money in your establishment and will never again.  I encourage your to require all of your employees to read Danny Meyers book, ""Setting the Table"" and learn something about hospitality.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

The grilled chicken was good but not excellent. The lobster ravioli was awful. It had little tiny shrimp scattered through the vodka sauce that tasted like strong fish.

"Atmosphere is nice and happy hour wines are $4.50 & $5.50 - decent price (4p-6p).  In my opinion, happy hour food is not a good deal.  Flatbreads are $4, but they are half the size of the regular, $8 ones. No savings there.  I asked the bartender which HH food was a good deal, and she acted like that was a stupid question, like ""It's happy hour, so portions will be small, duh.""  Arancini was a good size, $5 for 2.  But again, $7 for 3 on the regular menu so not much savings.  We ordered the fried artichokes from the regular menu, and for $8 got 7-8 artichoke hearts.  Meh.  $1 a piece? At Barcelona you get a full basket with Romanesco sauce for $7. The steak bites were good - it was a strip steak sliced with lemony mushroom sauce.  Yum.  The dinner rolls were doughy and not very good, a disappointment considering the bakeries available on The Hill.  My friend ordered take out for her husband and I watched the person in the kitchen swing her bag out to us at the bar, food containers tipped on their side.  That bothered me.

Even though it was hot, the deck had a nice breeze.  Our waitress Amy L. came over as soon as we were seated with water. It was Happy Hour.  The Happy Hour drink menu had several beers and wines and lots of specialty cocktails. I tried the Lemon Drop  and the Whiskey Sour. The waitress explained that the drinks were made with fresh juice. The Whiskey Sour uses a homemade sour mix. It was expertly made! My husband had a Mojito, also good. They were happy to make it with Sprite instead of seltzer.  The Happy Hour Menu was also extensive. We had the Kobe Beef sliders-$7 for 3! They were a good size and cooked perfectly. The crab cake sliders (2/$5) were also good.

Our food came out fairly quickly and was hot and delicious. Our drinks never went empty and she checked on us regularly. I will definetely be back to this location.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
Way better than outback!  * Hostess brings warm rolls and cinnamon butter when she seats you. * Peanuts to shell waiting on your table * Pick your steak out of a chilled deli case * Steaks so good you don't need to hide the flavor with Outback seasoning. * Better tasting sides.  A great place to go for a mid-priced steak!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"The camera eats first at this cute bakery. If you're looking for an instagram worthy spot this is it! It has cute decor and the food is pleasantly displayed. The service was fast and the staff was kind. The food tastes just as good as it looks. I enjoyed some of their macaroons, my favorite one is the Cookies and Cream. I've had macaroons on the streets of Paris and I promise you, you can't tell the difference! They have some flavors that are popular in France like Passion fruit and Caramel Fleur Del Sel. It's a 5 minute vacation worth having. If you're by the university it's definitely a spot I would recommend.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Pi Pizza in Central West End is an interesting place.  It's a great restaurant, but upon stepping through those red-and-glass doors, you can't help but get the sense that the restaurant's just a little too good for you.  It's how I envision the typical CWE restaurant-- well-oiled, tasty, but the tiniest bit haughty.  I like it.  But unlike some of the other restaurants along Euclid, which definitely appeal to certain age demographics, Pi is an ageless place.  Everybody belongs, but, paradoxically, nobody does.  Pi pizza is definitely of the 4-star sort.  It's good, absolutely good, but not something you crave.  When I was here last, we ordered the basic deep dish: the South Side Classico, featuring mozzarella, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and onions.  It really is delicious, and, contrary to what you might expect, heats up wonderfully in the oven or microwave-- so don't hesitate to get that large.  Prices, though, are probably my biggest gripe here.  I won't say that you don't get what you pay for, but they're definitely pushing the envelope of acceptability.  A large deep dish, probably good for no more than three people, will run around $22.  Waitstaff all seems gorgeous and friendly.  Suited up in all black, waiters are knowledgeable about the menu, are there when you want them to be, and can't be found when that's exactly what you want.  The outdoor seating area is pleasant, too, with the prime view of the Euclid-Macpherson intersection.  You can watch the Gold line buses drive through, peep on diners at Llywellyn's next door, and watch the eclectic crowd that funnels into and out of Left Bank Books.  Pi is definitely a solid choice for any occasion: a date, a Friday lunch break, late-night drinks, and apparently even coffee until 11:00am, as the billboard in front advertises.  Swing by and give it a shot, but remember: Pi is only better than you if you let it be.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

From yelp reviews I decided to try this place for another option for cheesesteaks! They had a special for a cheesesteak and fries for 15$ so my friend and I got that to split + 2 waters. It took awhile for the cheesesteak to come out but it came super hot! We got a lot of fries with our order which was great but def. Needed some salt and pepper. Luckily they give you ketchup packets to go with the fries. Cheesesteak was okay. Really like the hoagie bread it came on. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The meat was thinly sliced steak and we got provolone cheese melted inside with onions. The steak was a bit bland even though the quality of the meat was pretty good. Overall it's just an okay sandwich. Still on the quest for the best cheesesteak in Philly !,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Pizza was good but the service was awful.  I live down the street and they wanted to charge like $4 for delivery.  So I went and picked it up.  They didn't have change.  Offered quarters instead of singles or to pay by card.  I opted the card route.  They didn't tell me there was a CC convenience charge until after I ran my card.  When I got home the pizza was good.  However, my taco pie the lettuce was old, barely shred, and there was about 2 oz of ground beef on the entire thing.  I will not be going back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"If I'm being honest it was just kind of a weird dining experience.  Was seating for a large group just fine but ordering food was extremely difficult and we kept having to chase down the waiter because we waited for 30+ min to order without then showing up.  We had to do the same thing when we were wanting the check at the end.  Meanwhile our water cups never got refilled and some of our food orders got mixed up.  The food was delicious (besides the chicken wings which had no flavoring besides the dipping sauce which had a strong balsamic-like flavor that wasn't very appealing).    The Thai chicken basil dish I ordered as my mai course was delicious which flavorful chicken with a good mix of basil and vegetables.    Overall, next time Id just order take out and spare the hassle of chasing the waiter down so I could more easily enjoy the good food!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"For whatever reason reviews are good on this place. This restaurant is a tiny place on the middle of an industrial area. The dishes really cater to non-spicy palates with several dishes that are way too sweet and too runny (i.e.. Both the green and the red curries are very soup-y, non spicy and almost sugary). The place also caters to more Western taste with a number of dishes that are neither thai nor fusion (i.e. Stake and ribs).  I ended up here with family on a celebration. I made reservation at 8 not knowing that their kitchen closes around 8:15-8:30 (this wasn't mentioned anywhere on OpenTable and reservations are allowed up until 15 minutes before the kitchen closes!). While we were there, we ordered our mains and the waitress didn't indicate the kitchen was closing so we couldn't make further orders for dessert or anything past 8:30. By 9 we were already out. The bill came to $120 for three dishes and an appetizer and without alcohol.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Macaroons are such a weird dessert. I've had them in the past but they were never ""oh my god"" worthy. They always just left me feeling meh, not worth the sugar intake for feeling like I was just eating air. Side note, one can judge how much I enjoy a food dish by the amount of times I say ""oh my god"". Now back to the story, The Gallery Pastry Shop left me saying ""oh my god"" after eating their macaroons. By far the best I've ever tasted and oh so beautiful too. They come in a variety of flavors but the dark chocolate left me wanting 27 more in my mouth in that moment. So Wednesday I'll be heading back to buy 27 more macaroons when they are only $1 a pop. Yes, Wednesday is the day to go and get them cheap! You are welcome. Now I can't wait to check out their Sunday brunch.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This is the only Japanese restaurant I've been able to try out while staying in the Nashville area but I was really impressed! The atmosphere and the service was really great. Both the host and waitress were super nice and friendly; the waitress was really interested in learning more about Canada after I mentioned that was where I was from and it was really pleasant talking to her. The restaurant itself was also very pretty and very clean.  The food itself was very cheap and it was pretty good. The miso soup and the gyoza were perfect and they had a huge selection of sushi to try from. We ordered a bunch of different rolls and they were all tasty. My only complaint is that the ebi nigiri was a little dry when it was served to us and while I did eat it, I wasn't super impressed with it. I have a feeling that maki is more of their specialty than nigiri or sashimi.  I'm definitely looking forward to going back if I get the chance, especially to try some of their other selections. Maybe I'll try to go for Happy Hour, where they have a lot of rolls and appetizers available for lower prices.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I normally just get fuel here or maybe a drink and a snack, but they also have the sandwich shop inside ready to make you a hot sub in a flash. The window washer containers are always full of nice blue soapy window cleaning fluid, which is one of the reasons I like this place so much. Many other gas stations have plain or dirty water in their washer bins, but at Wawa you know you will be able to actually clean your car windows.

"My kids like this place, but it's been about 2 years since we came here. We were out and about, they got hungry, so I decided to take them out today as a 'treat.' It's not a treat for me to come here, believe me. The food is consistently terrible, and the place is filthy. Well, today's trip really took a turn after we finished eating. I have three kids, so I'm collecting myself and I barely got up from my seat when our waitress (a term that hardly applies, since it's a buffet, and we only had water), got in my face and said, ""The service was good?"" with like this aggressive air. I was taken aback, and then after a second or two, I realized she probably thought I was going to stiff her on the tip. I backed away from her, because she was basically an inch away from my face, and I said, ""I thought I put it (the tip) on my card at the front?"" I honestly couldn't remember how it was done, because you pay when you sit down, and I thought they'd have to run my card again for the tip. Then another waitress comes over to shake me down. Meanwhile, I have my toddler son pulling at me, and there's like two hundred people in this fucking hellhole, and I'm just trying to make sure he doesn't run off. Basically the two of them block me and they said, write it (the tip) on your receipt. OK. So I put my son back in the high chair, fish through my wallet for the receipt. I said, you know what, I'll just do it at the front. Oh no. Miss Waitress pulls out a pen. I said, oh no, if that's how it's going to be, I have a fucking pen. I sit down, and this bitch *is now looking over my shoulder to see what I write down.* I was hot now. I am not proud to say I threw the receipt on the table, but I was so embarrassed and frustrated, that I did. But it wasn't over. Even though it is a customer receipt and there is no signature line, she says, you sign it. I said, there's nowhere to sign it! You already have my card. Then the second waitress comes back. I sign the receipt and walk out. Halfway to my car, I marched back in with all of my kids and did complain. I'm sure it didn't make one hell of a difference but at least I showed my children that you shouldn't allow anyone to treat you like a fucking animal.

"Before I say anything negative, I have to say that a grocery store in this area was much needed. Provides mostly fresh fruits and veggies to that area of Philadelphia versus the local corner store. So thumbs up for that.   BUT I would rather go somewhere else.  1. lines were long... and even if there were 3 of us in line it took forever 2. cashier was inept (kept asking me ""what is this?"" and i would say things like ""lettuce"" or ""corn"" etc... i mean, I know I'm not your FIRST customer, I've been in line this whole time) 3. NO PAPER BAGS i.e. killing me with the ridiculous amounts of plastic bags. I like to rely on the paperbags from the grocery store because we do all our recycling those bags. So that sucked. Makes me hate them kinda. 4. Couldn't bring our cart to the car because it had those metal upsidedown U shaped barriers to prevent shoppers from stealing the carts. So we had to pull the car up front and it was just a lot of unnecessary traffic in front of the store because of that. Poor planning. 5. My peaches went bad in 2 days. Riddle me that.  6.

"It was one of the best experiences at an airport restaurant(or stand), I have ever had. Usually I don't expect much walking into a restaurant at an airport, much less up to a hotdog stand. But I ordered the creole dog with relish and onions. It was absolutely delicious. It had a good spiciness, was cooked the perfect way for a hotdog stand hotdog, and the relish was nice and sweet to match the spiciness of the dog. I'd almost compare it to a chaurice hotdog. Absolutely delicious.  The service though was mediocre at best. They were in the middle of shift change, but I would expect better.

"I am determined to try every John Besh restaurant, and my friend who was visiting, thinks Aaron Sanchez is her favorite FoodNetwork star, so it made sense to come to JohnnySanchez for her last night in town.  Plus we love guacamole.  We had a reservation for 7:30 on a Monday but got there almost an hour early and were seated with no problem.  We both ordered Mango Jalapeno margaritas, mine didn't have jalapeno's floating in it, I'm a heat-wimp.  They were great, and I'm usually not a salted rim margarita fan, but the chili powder salt brought the drink to a whole new level.  The plantain and tortilla chips are made in house along with the salsa and salsa verde, which were all excellent.  We probably could have made a meal out of that and the guacamole we ordered as a starter.  I've never had salsa verde that good.  Our server was Ana and she was new but you wouldn't know it from her service.  We were in no rush but she still made sure to check on us often and answer all the questions we had, such as ""how often do Aaron and John come in?"" haha.  For entrees, I got the Bistec A La Parilla, and my friend got the lamb enchiladas.  My skirt steak came with what tasted like an avocado-lime butter on top, side of Covey Rise sautéed vegetables, fresh, bright tasting pickled carrots and onions, and corn tortillas.  Everything was delicious.  My friends lamb enchiladas were good but the mole sauce was lacking, we couldn't detect any stand-out flavors.    The restaurant is fairly small with extremely high ceilings and a mish-mash of different lighting fixtures.  One side of the restaurant has calm, neutral wall designs and the other side has a distinctive Latin flair, in the form of blown-up versions of Aaron Sanchez's tattoos that take up the whole wall.   We really liked this restaurant but I could detect no Besh influence in the dishes.  Not a real issue.  Bummed me out a little bit that the tvs above the bar are viewable from everywhere in the restaurant.. Sometimes I just want to eat dinner out without a tv present.

It is nice because in addition to Hertz additional toppings they give you an extra sauce and as many toppings as you want they have a little bar that you can choose your toppings from. I really liked it because they had greek olives, feta cheese and a delicious tomato, cucumber, and onion salad mixture to put on top of your gyro. This is the first time that I've been somewhere that gives you a choice of toppings and unlimited ones at that.  Although we didn't try them, their desserts looked good as well.  The decor was nice however the one bad thing about this place was that they had benches there were incredibly uncomfortable to sit on. They need to put some cushions on the bench or something.

After awkwardly standing for several more min (in a near empty diner), I ask another server who tells me to wait longer (looking annoyed that we would ask). I ask if we can just grab a seat at the counter, she rolls her eyes and says we can. At least five min after sitting, the crabby older walks over with a terrible attitude and asks ""is this to go?""

"I used a Groupon on my visit to the restaurant. I know when  some people hear that you can get unlimited toppings alarm sirens start going off like the Kool-Aid man saying "" OH YEAH"" lol  Please remember that this cracker crust thin pizza ;so there is only so much the crust will hold.  Plus having too many toppings could be an overkill on total taste.  I will admit thin crust is not my thing but since they had a Groupon, I was willing to give it a try. If you are looking for a place to have a nice not to heavy lunch but somewhat filling, this is the place to go. It will hold you down till dinner time.  I got 2 pizzas with the  Groupon: 1  with Chicken with house sauce, black olives, and pesto sauce on side. The other with chicken with house sauce, black olives, pesto sauce on side. Both were equally tasty and filling. 3/5  I would highly suggest not getting the pesto sauce as a sauce for the whole pizza. It's extremely seasoned and salty. Having it on the whole pizza will totally ruin the whole pizza experience. I would suggest getting the sauce on the  pesto sauce like I did.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This gem of a restaurant is definitely worth a visit when in NOLA. We did not have a reservation, but took our chance and was able to be seated within 5 minutes. The restaurant is small and well set up for dining; cozy without feeling cramped.   We started with cocktails beautifully crafted by Tyler, the talented mixologist. When it came time to order our food, it was difficult to decide which selection to make as all sounded so good.  Started with a bibb lettuce salad with apples and blue cheese topped with quinoa. Delicious and light. I ordered the special entree for the night, a red fish with Brussels sprouts and mustard spaetzle. Wow. Fantastic! My husband ordered the halibut and vegetables spiced with dukkah. Another excellent choice. My son ordered the braised short ribs. Phenomenal.  The atmosphere is lively, filled with happy customers and staff. Zasu deserves the many accolades it consistently receives. I highly recommend this restaurant to foodies and non-foodies alike.

"I thoroughly enjoyed dinner with my family at binkleys the other night, they have a great menu that has lots of options and everyone will find something that they would like to eat. They have pizza, burgers, sandwiches, entrées, seafood all priced very well! We had fried mushrooms and fried pickles for appetizers and they were both delicious and perfectly fried. For my meal I opted for a 10"" ""Wild Mushroom"" pizza: (pesto/mushrooms/roasted red peppers/red and green onion) $14.  It was a perfect size for one person, and I had some leftovers. I also got to taste the chicken pesto tortellini which was very good.    Binkley's Kitchen is a great choice if you are not sure what type of food you want or if you have a large group, there are plenty of options to please everyone!

"Even after hearing all the bad reviews from my friends at work, my wife and I decided to stop in.  We had gone to Mad4Mex but it was way to crowded. We noticed upon our arrival that Zocalo is a little pricey.  Having been craving tex-mex we ventured in anyway.  When we went inside no one was there to meet us. We waited for a while in the bar area but no one showed up for a couple of minutes.  The waitress showed us outside into the outdoor seating area.  I ordered a margarita and my wife ordered a water. I love margaritas, but this one had so much lime in it that it was nearly undrinkable. It was so sour that I forced myself to drink it.   We asked if the meal came with chips and salsa or anything, but were told that you had to pay for it....which is fine with us....It's just not typical for a restaurant that has such expensive entrees.  We ordered the guacamole which was listed as coming with chips and salsa. When it arrived the guacamole was topped with a tablespoon of pico de gallo, but that was the extent of the salsa. The amount of chips were meager for the size of the guacamole, which was presented in a really cool pestle.  We then ordered a separate order of salsa to get our fix.  The guacamole was decent, not the best I have ever had, but not the worst either. The salsa was thin, but good.  We were not given extra chips with our salsa, but instead were supposed to use the ones that already came with the guacamole.  As a result, we had to wait 15 minutes for another basked of chips when the first ran out.  The waitstaff was VERY slow. There appeared to only be 2 waitress on staff and they were also serving as hostess, bartenders and the cleaning crew.  The 15 minutes we waited for the chips, our waitress was inside cleaning dust off of tables.   We each ordered a salad. Mine was a spicy Caesar salad and my wife's had cooked mushrooms and onions. Both of our salads were decent, but nothing spectacular.   All-in-all. The food here wasn't great and it wasn't bad. Every step of the way (side of dressing, extra chips, happy-hour only at the bar...which had no bartender, etc...) we felt nickled and dimed. The place didn't have very many people and almost no atmosphere. The waitstaff was slow as %^&*, because they were either cleaning, chatting or trying to do 3 jobs at once.   I wont be back to Zocalo, which is a shame because it is so close to my work.  The food, drink....and more importantly the waitstaff and prices are better elsewhere.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I wanted to like this restaurant, I really did. The decor was awesome and the hostess greeted us so friendly. Pricing was reasonable for lunch. Had an appetizer, a sandwich and a lemonade.  The appetizer: I ordered the lobster & shrimp bisque and I have had better. I prefer Pappadeaux's lobster bisque and if you have ever had it you know it is rich, creamy and chunky (you can definitely see the lobster chunks before grabbing your spoon and stirring the bisque). However, this was NOT the case with the lobster bisque I had at Sullivan's. It seemed like they skimped out on the lobster and shrimp bisque. When it was served, it looked like a creamy soup with nothing in it. The taste was good and the black pepper that I had the waitress top it off with enhanced the flavor.  The sandwich: I ordered the Southern Fried chicken sandwich as recommended by the waitress. I wish I had ordered the hamburger instead or better yet I wish I didn't have the pickle sauce as the spread. The flavors of the fried chicken and the pickle sauce on the brioche bun didn't mesh well. I didn't even finish the entire sandwich because the pickle sauce was overwhelming. I ended up opening the sandwich and only eating the fried chicken patty. (I have had better chicken fried chicken at Texas Roadhouse and Applebee's).  I ordered the strawberry lemonade and it definitely was NOT homemade. Perhaps the strawberry juice was homemade especially since real strawberries are added to the drink but the lemonade itself tasted like a Country Time lemonade mix.   For my appetizer, sandwich entree and strawberry lemonade drink I paid, $27 before tip.  My friend ordered the $18.50 mixer. She liked the lobster and shrimp bisque (but she noted that she too has had better). She did not care for the salmon. She said it was dry and there was no crispy well seasoned skin at the bottom of the salmon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"We last visited the Phily Diner and Sports Bar in September and I left a review on Facebook (with no comment from the site). We wanted to leave it here on Yelp as well.  I haven't eaten here in a while but we were craving some club sandwiches for lunch and decided to order to pick-up. What an absolute waste of money. Neither sandwich was made the way I asked (neither had the addition I'd asked for when I placed the order), the bread tasted day-old, the meat was dry, and the sandwiches had no flavor. I know I ordered to pick-up, but there's no way I can fathom that the fries we were served were fresh. By the way - if you throw hot fries on top of a cold sandwich and then seal them in a take-out container, you end doing something akin to steaming your sandwiches. The second time I walked in (because I came back in for something from the bakery) I was greeted by a girl with a smug attitude and had to witness a customer berating the girl trying to check people out (no manager in site, no one to hep her). The only reason I'm giving two-stars here on Yelp is because the cheesecake was good. I used to really like going here, but it seems like some of the quality got lost in the shuffle during the transition to glitz and glamour.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I mentally bookmarked this place when a co-worker told me they had homemade baklava ice cream. A few months later, we finally got an opportunity to go. It was around 8 pm on Thurs night and the place was completely packed. I figured there would just be a few people, but I was wrong. After waiting a little bit, our table was cleared and we sat down.   The one thing I liked about their menu was they offered a lot of sampler choices so you could try a little everything especially if you're not familiar with Greek food.  We started with their sample dip appetizer which included Tzatziki, hummus, and another dip I'm not sure what it was. This was perfect since Jeff got this Tzatziki and I got my hummus.  I ordered the moussaka (eggplant, potato, cheese casserole) and it was good. it was definitely not as heavy as other moussaka's I've had before. Jeff ordered  the chicken with prosciutto in Vodka sauce.  He says, ""The chicken was flavorful, but the prosciutto was a little too thick for my liking.  The sauce was delicious.""  The baklava ice cream was seriously cinnamonized (yes, I made that word up). At one point, it felt like we were eating cinnamon altoids ice cream. My co-worker said that's not how it usually tastes though.  It was a bit far for us to go back to, but if it's in your neighborhood, check it out.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

So, my family decided to get food delivered to our hotel room since it has been a very long day.

I ordered online at 9:30 pm and received my order at 10:15 pm. What fantastic service! The food was still piping hot! The Milano pizza was perfect! I also ordered the jumbo garlic parm chicken wings and they sure are jumbo! I would have given this place 5 stars but the chicken was lacking flavor. However, my 10 year old son begs to differ. He loved it and he thought it had the right amount of flavor but he was also dunking it in ranch dressing. I would also recommend the Naples pizza.

"God, where to start? Well, how about we start with the service? It is awful. I went to the Trolley Car Diner on a Sunday afternoon with some friends for breakfast. Our waitress couldn't manage to crack a smile once the entire time we were there. In fact, she was frowning every time I looked at her. I'm okay with a waitress that is less than enthusiastic (I can't stand those wackos at places like TGIFridays), but this woman was treating us like she just saw us dead-leg her grandmother down the steps of the Art Museum. For instance, she didn't say anything to us when we were ordering. Instead, she just scowled at each one of until we came to realize that this was her way of asking us what we wanted. After we had all placed our orders, she just turned and walked off without saying anything. Additionally, she never asked us (through words or otherwise) if we wanted refills on our drinks. The only time she checked up on us was when we had already finished eating.   And now for the food: it tasted worse than the service would if it were possible to eat service. Seriously, I have made better french toast drunk at three in the morning without washing my hands after smoking Marlboros and scratching my nuts all day. I think they should have labeled it as ""grilled toast"" on the menu because it had almost no egg on it. No amount of maple syrup could save this abomination. It was dry, unpleasant, and extremely un-eggy (plus they used wheat bread). I also had a side order of eggs, which was ironically less eggy than expected. I think they might use egg substitute or something because they were kind of watery and tasted like someone had farted on them.  The ONLY reason why I am giving this place two stars is because of the sandwiches at the deli. I had one a while ago (don't remember what I got), but it must have been alright because it didn't make me want to punch a midget hooker in the mouth with a roll of quarters (like the french toast did). Oh yeah, they have bottled beer at the deli and you can ""make your own six pack"". The concept is cool, but the beers are waaaaay overpriced.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Tandoori chicken raw on the inside but what gets me the most irate is the seasoning. That's the whole reasoning behind spending $70 on takeout. I want to taste all those delicious Indian spices and just this past weekend, the food was cooked but had absolutely no flavor, like someone forgot to Season it.

"We were visiting Boise and really wanted a great steak. After reading reviews on multiple restaurants, we decided on Stagecoach. They were super busy for a Monday night, but they got our party of two in quickly. We took that as a great sign! I ordered a pineapple press cocktail and all I could taste was lemon. I only drank half so I was a bit disappointed since it was a $10 cocktail. I was also really looking forward to an appetizer before dinner, I love a good app! But sadly, they had NOT one appetizer that didn't contain fish, I can't eat fish :(.  Anyway, the salad and bread before dinner was delicious! We each ordered the bacon wrapped filet, medium. I could tell before I even cut my steak that it was very much a medium rare, border-lining on rare. They threw it back on the grill, but had they been better trained, they wouldn't have had to. The steak was also very bland and not seasoned at all. Will a good amount of salt added, it was ok. It definitely wasn't the super delicious steak I was hoping for and my baked potato was super dry, even after drowning it in butter. So half the meal was amazing, and half was meh. The one thing I would go back for?? The turtle cheese cake. It was the most delicious turtle cheesecake I've ever eaten, and I'm not a skinny girl!! LOL.

I would come back again, however, customer service needs to improve. The lady who served me came seemed very uninterested that I was there. I understand that it may just be cultural differences. However saying thank you for coming or have a nice day wouldn't hurt.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"The Oceanaire Seafood Room means to be Philadelphia's swanky new seafood restaurant with a dramatic dining experience reminiscent of a grand old 1930's ocean liner.  I'd have to say they pulled it all off quite nicely.  When you walk into the Oceanaire you find yourself greeted by a huge space with very high ceilings, beautiful art deco theme, a grand staircase and of course some of that 1930's big band music.  The bars (alcohol and oyster) are also near the entrance, opulent and beautifully lit, this place definitely gets an A+ for its execution of ambiance and interior design. Now if only the food was as interesting as the venue itself.    Oceanaire's menu is pretty large, although by far not the largest I've seen for a fresh seafood restaurant.  They have a decent selection of fish flown in that morning and a smaller selection of ""specialties"" which may also vary from day to day.  Most of the sides and appetizer dished are ""family"" sized portions, although between myself and the two other people I dined with I felt that the dishes were stretched kinf of thin, especially the salad which I really think I could have finished by myself. Unfortunately, while the fish was admittedly very fresh and tasty, the various dishes along with their presentation were a little on the bland side.  All of the food was certainly passable, definitely good, but nothing really piqued my interest as exceptional.  The Boston salad was good, with grapes, sherry vinaigrette and a hint of anise --- thankfully just a hint, as I feel that any more anise would have made for a rather unpleasant salad.  The appetizer of lump crab cake was quite delicious --- probably my favorite item of the evening.  The server claimed that their crab cakes are made of about 95% crab and I'd say that that sounded about right!  The crab was sweet, succulent, fresh and when paired with the mustard mayonnaise sauce which they sided with the cakes the flavors were really top notch. I ordered an entre of ""Black & Bleu"" Mako Shark with sweet onion confit and bleu cheese.  Sadly this dish was so boring I really couldn't eat it.  The onion confit was just not that great and had a weird kind of tangy bite to it that just wasn't pleasant to me, the blue cheese tasted rather weak and the mako itself was simply very plain.  I wish I would have ordered the flounder stuffed with crab, shrimp & brie.  I also tried their mahi-mahi which was cooked with a chili sauce which was pretty tasty, better than my mako, in any case.   The side of potatoes gratin were good as long as you ate them as soon as possible after being set on your table. Once the dish began to cool, it became much less appetizing and turned into a tough and chewy mass of cubed potatoes.  The dessert selection was fairly wide, but I went with the crme brulee.  I know, so unexciting but I just love the stuff so much I can never turn it down.  Our portion of brulee was very large --- two brulee fanatics were unable to finish it --- topped with a small amount of fresh berries.  As far as crme brulee goes, I would say Oceanaire's was somewhat better than average. Service at Oceanaire is very pleasant and knowledgeable, the waiters weren't always hanging over the table, but they weren't M.I.A. either.  Its not that I won't ever return to The Oceanaire, but I don't see myself making much effort to come back any time soon either.  I say try it out and form your own opinion as the place really fell in a grey area for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Fun fun atmosphere and great food. We did Sunday lunch. The Irish coffee had a fantastic chilled and whipped foam on top of hot spiked coffee and it was memorable!  The Bloody Mary was fine. Just enough horseradish.  We shared three plates for 2 people and left full!  Cheddar biscuits with Uni butter was fantastic and perfect compliment to my Bloody Mary! The tuna Poke was a meal in itself. The large chunks of tuna and the crushed fried crispy wonton garnish was to die for. Only recommendation is for the kitchen to lighten up on the additional salt. The soy provides enough.  The avocado toast was huge. I loved all the salmon  and the addition of an egg yolk that dressed the whole thing in a silky smoothness. Only recommendation is for the kitchen to hold on the salt.  I will be back to try other items soon!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I've come to Aziatisch for a while now. They have great staff and amazing prepare Asian food.   First, their food is great. I love their tofu, chicken pad Thai, chicken kabobs and rice. They also have a nice variety of vegetables. However, they seem to try to sell so much that it feels a little stuffed. If you want your food heated up they have a microwave.  The staff here is very nice! They usually have either this one young woman or a man, who I believe is the owner working the cash register and getting your food. They are both very nice and polite.   This location is located in The Ardmore Farmer's Market so a line can form. Also, parking can be tough.   There is no direct seating at Aziatisch, but the Farmer's Market has both indoor and outdoor seating available.

"I really don't know why I don't think to eat here more often.  It's less than a 5 minute walk from my door.  I guess if I had to narrow it down to one main reason, I'd say it's really not spectacular.  I really get enough poboys at work, and if I'm home and want a sandwich, I just make my own.  It's kinda a little grocery store, with lots and lots of alcoholic beverages and energy drinks, cokes (I'm from the south.  Everything is coke), teas, etc. To top it off they even have four loco.  I could swear I heard they outlawed that stuff, but whatever, vodka/redbull, Irish Coffee, what's the difference except is super cheap an appears to come in many fruity flavors. Grape I notice is a popular choice. Not that I drink that crap...I'm just tired and rambling. The grocery store appears kinda clusterfunked and not pine-fresh scented to say the least.  Truthfully, I wouldn't be entirely surprised if a saw a 4 legged furry shoot past me as I stroll down the aisle.  But alas!  I have a brave heart and a strong stomach. And I'm sure they always use proper food safety procedures.  I eat in the quarter for crying out loud, my standards aren't that high.  The deli offers all kind of poboys, chicken tenders, fries.  Up till last week the only thing I ever got was the roast beef and gravy, dressed, add swiss. Never been disappointed.  I like that they sell a reasonable sized half a poboy for like tree-fiddy.  Add a bag of chips and a canned coke and you got lumch for around five bucks.  Its hard to beat that.  However, last time I was in there I was also feeding the kiddo.  I contemplated the safest choice for food safety.  I went with chicken fingers, fries and toast plate. I don't know if it was becase we came in at 2:30/3ish, but everything from that fryer tasted like funky old grease.  I know they close early, and perhaps they had fried a bunch of stuff that day, or if that's just typical.  If I were to venture out into the fried items, I would suggest inquiring as to when they changed the oil in the fryer last.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"As a DoorDash'er, I am very disappointed in this location. I have received many orders to pick up for customers, of whom I represent, who have already purchased food from them, and have chosen myself to pick their food up for them.  Every time I come inside, the workers here give me a dirty look. Every single one of them look me in the eye, and then turn away, like I wasn't even there. They just don't want to help me out. I notice this, and know it's because I'm a Dasher, because they do not do this with other customers coming into their restaurant. They also lie to DoorDash, and send them a message stating the order for the customer is ready, and then I show up, and they haven't even started making the order yet.   Very unprofessional, which is odd, because two other Filaberto's locations are awesome, and very courteous, but this location is really bad. Really bad attitudes at this location. My advice to them: just quit your job if you hate it so much, or just stop DoorDash orders altogether. Is Dashers haven't done anything to you, so why you treat us the way you do is uncalled for.

"Reno is arguably the bastion of all-you-can-eat sushi. It is ubiquitous, beloved, and infamous for producing a ""sushi coma"" of overindulgence. But--newest kid on the block--Cove Sushi has a different idea in mind.  The menu is presented as à la carte, but with a ""meal deal"" twist. All meals are available with an appetizer and dessert: a one roll meal ($13.99), two roll meal ($16.99), or three roll meal ($19.99). You can substitute the long rolls for either three hand rolls or eight pieces of nigiri, and substitute the appetizer and dessert as well. Mix and match combinations are welcome. It seems a little confusing at first, but it turned out to be fairly simple. My daughter and I ordered three long rolls, a hand roll, five orders of nigiri--two pieces each--and four appetizers, sans dessert.  We began with miso soup, yakiton, wakame, and baked mussels. The soup was hot, with plenty of tofu and scallion, and just the thing for a chilly evening. The deep-fried cheese and seafood egg rolls were my hungry college student's favorite, so I just had a bite and let her devour the rest. The seaweed salad comes with the optional inclusion of octopus or salmon skin, and my choice was a happy surprise. The salmon skin was crispy, with a fair amount of meat still attached. Easily one of the most enjoyable examples of this appetizer. Finally, the mussels were just damn perfect. Large, tender, and doused in a great sauce with a touch of heat.  For nigiri I chose sake (salmon), hamachi (yellowtail), hokkigai (surf clam), tai (snapper), tako (octopus), and unagi (freshwater eel). The fish-to-rice ratio was exceptionally good, with nice big cuts that were still bite-sized, at least for my ample maw. Very fresh, lots of flavor, and easily among the most tender surf clam and octopus in town. Both can tend to be chewy, but these folks know what they're doing.   My daughter's selection of long rolls began with the chameleon, a mix of crystal shrimp and spicy crab, topped with avocado and cooked scallop. Next the godzilla, a deep-fried tempura roll of salmon, yellowtail, and albacore, topped with sriracha. Last, the spider, with soft shell crab and cucumber, topped with avocado and tobiko. Though I'm not a tremendous fan of hot sushi rolls, the crunch of the godzilla was a nice textural counterpoint to the fresh fish flavors, spiked with a bit of spice. The spider was very good, with plenty of crunch and flavor from the crab, blended well with the fresh ingredients. Best of all, the chameleon won me over for taste and presentation. Each piece was crowned with a small cooked scallop, and our server mentioned that everything is cooked to order. I do appreciate attention to detail.  I ordered the spicy scallop hand roll as almost an afterthought, and I'm certainly glad I did. The little bay scallops really got their chance to shine, assisted by a fantastic spicy sauce, scallion, and other tasty bits I didn't pause to identify. The nori was softened a bit--making it a little tough to bite through--but that didn't slow me down. Probably the best thing I tasted during the meal, I'd definitely order two or three of them the next time around. Even with the couple extra items ordered, we still left satisfied for less than we'd have paid for a traditional Reno AYCE meal. Bonus.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"The only reason we went here was because it was recommended by a local on a tour, and a member of our tour was determined to try it.  As for me, I know that there is no reason ever to wait very long for anything in New Orleans.  If you have to wait at one place, there is sure to be another place of equal or better quality with a shorter wait, if there is a wait at all.  So, when we got there, and the wait was reported to be one hour and 15 minutes, I was ready to leave.  We didn't.  We stayed.  That just got us off on the wrong foot right there because Deanie's doesn't handle ""busy"" very well.  People were working their tails off, but it was still difficult to get a drink, difficult to find a place to wait, and difficult to imagine any food could be worth that wait.  They need better organization.  When we did sit down to eat, my wife and I both ordered Onion Rings.  The waitress asked me, ""Are you sure?""  Intimating that an order is large, and two might be too much.  I reaffirmed my order, but, when the order came, she only brought out one order because even though I just told her what I wanted twice, she was still certain she knew better than I what I wanted.  She did it again with my salad.  She could not believe I would order a salad without any dressing on it.  I told her I didn't want dressing, but, when she brought my salad out, she had to ask me again if I were sure.  Yeah, I'm sure.  I've been eating all my life, and I know how I like my food.  When our food came, it was good, but, I am sorry to report, it wasn't any better than any I've had at other places in the French Quarter, and certainly not worth waiting over an hour for.  But, of all these things, there was only one thing that truly angered me.  We were only in a group of four, and, yet, an ""automatic"" tip of 18% was added to our bill.    I did not tell our waitress that we usually tip at least 20%, but often our tip is 25 to 30%, and we have been known to tip as much as 50% for exceptional service.  This waitress was probably doing her best, but, to me, she was more insulting than helpful, and I probably would have tipped her 20 to 25%, but, since she just took it upon herself to reward herself for being so annoying and taking 18%, I left it at that.    Note to waitstaff -  I may look like an idiot to you, but I am not, so please don't treat me like one.  In all my years of life, I have come to know what I like to eat, the flavors I like, and the quantities I like.  I am certain that my knowledge of my own appetite is much better than our knowledge of my appetite.  Please, just do your job, and leave the food decisions to the guests unless they specifically ask for your help.  And, if those guests are in a small, easily manageable group, don't automatically ""assume"" a tip.  We are not the cheapskates.  That's your boss who doesn't pay you even minimum wage so that you have to ""steal"" money from customers just to make a living.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Odd for when there are only 6 tables, 12 tops, around 1/3 of the capacity.  - As I mentioned, food was good but half way through, I saw something odd in my soup, with a bar code on it. It was a label, presumable from the cilantro or other ingredient.   - The Evil Jungle Princess arrived with a good presentation, the noodles were hot and well spiced. I liked it a lot - until I had a piece of the chicken, which seemed cold and hard - a tell tale sign of being made in advance and just added to the dish at the last minute. I wish they would have cooked the chicken to order along with the rest of the dish.  - As the other patron and I were still enjoying our meal, a check appears on the table without inquiring about dessert. Since service had started out slow, it seemed as though it was being rushed at the wrong moment to make up for it.  I sincerely hope they can work out some of these issues and this restaurant has some potential.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This place...how have I never been here before?! Me and my boyfriend go to the Ambler car show every year and always look for somewhere to eat. HOW did we never find this place until this year?!? My boyfriend is a burger connoisseur and when we saw the menu it was kind of a no brainer where we were getting lunch.   The menu has such a variety of already built burgers and chicken sandwiches (amongst other options) AND a never ending list of customizable options for either sandwich! I loveeee having so many options especially ones you don't find everywhere such a fig jam, roasted onion cream cheese, espresso BBQ sauce.... the list is never ending!  And just when we thought it couldn't get any better we saw the mac and cheese section of the menu. GET OUTTA HERE! Mac and cheese AND burgers?! Exactly what dreams are made of! Well, at least what our dreams are made of!   My boyfriend made his own burger with a side of mac and cheese and I got the Huy Fong Honey Chicken Sandwich with the hand cut fries. When it came out I was in astonishment at just how freaking nice it looked! I had never seen such a glorious sandwich on such a beautiful shiney bun before! I cannot express how excited I was just on the appearance of this sandwich. It was just one awesome thing after another at this place! I took a bite out of the sandwich and it was just magical. A sandwich that tastes as amazing as it looked! I wasn't sure if this place was real or just a figment of our imaginations. It was a messy sandwich for me, but my gosh it was tasty.   I was so excited about how good this place was that I was texting all my friends about it and making future plans to return while I was still there.  Be sure not to miss this place , It is easy to miss walking by but absolutely a restaurant to try if you enjoy great food with a variety of options at a reasonable price.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"It looks like people are enjoying this place. I'm not sure what they're seeing that I am not. I even gave it two tries to see if my initial impression was wrong.  First of all, the seating is almost all high top tables. Personally I find these uncomfortable, so we chose the one larger regular table near the front.  While going through the line, the young lady in hipster glasses at the cash register acted like I was inconveniencing her just by placing my order.   Can someone explain this? If you don't like working with customers, why work in customer service? As a business owner, I always do my work with a smile and make sure the customer knows I am working for them, not the other way around. Seems so obvious, right?  Near our table, there were napkins and pieces of food on the ground. It felt dirty. The waitress brought us our burgers. Very attractive burgers I have to say, but again, this waitress acted though as if somehow I was really inconveniencing her.   The burgers and fries were tasty, but I still felt hungry after finishing them and felt like I deserved a little more. When you figure that you're paying in the thirty-something dollar range to get a burger with your friend, maybe people expect a little more? These burgers ain't made of gold, people.   Skip Grub. Great idea, poor execution.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I went here with friends and I was very impressed.  It's very deceiving from the look of the building out front but inside, it's very modern.   They offer two menus, one at regular prices, then the other at 50% off prices but almost the same menu options.  Both waiters couldn't really give us a good reason as to the difference but we said ""why not,  let's just do the 50% off"".    The quality of the food was very good and the steak and chicken were excellent.  It's BYOB which is great.  If it's really crowded, it can be somewhat noisy but the check was definitely reasonable.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"My new fav local place.  Met up with a group of friends Friday night. Skipped the table and we sat at the bar.  The service is SPOT ON. Our bartender Amanda was awesome. We also met Amy the manager and Lee, the owner. These people care about the diners and the attention shows. Even though our Lieutenant governor was also dining there with his family, our group received a lot of attention. It's part of their signature.  Free beer and wine until they get their liquor license .  But it always comes down to the food, doesn't it. And it didn't disappoint. The food is first rate.  Tried the mushroom risotto with blackened salmon. DAYMN!!!  And a few appetizers. This is NOT your average eat. This is a foodie restauranteur doing what he does best.  So!!! Nachos. Not my usual fav, but shared. Whew!!!   The lamb chops are an app. For real!!!  Where does that ever happen. And they're pure perfection.  I'll let the pics speak.  PS.

They're flat out annoying and need to work on situating their menu before they try getting buddy buddy with every customer. The food: breakfast was not good at all. Whoever is cooking in that back room needs to learn that food should be hot when served. The pre-made dishes.... They're okay, however I have had much better. Long story short I won't be returning and if you know what's good for yourself you will avoid this establishment.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"There are only 10 restaurants in all of Middle Tennessee that rank among the Top 20 on both Yelp and TripAdvisor simultaneously (as of today). Bakersfield is one of them, which is probably why I expected more.  You certainly won't be disappointed with your meal here, seemingly inspired by the cuisine of the Mexican state of Oaxaca. You can definitely count on quality ingredients and clever flavor combinations. Like most of Nashville's trendy new eateries, it's pricey, hip, noisy, and hard to access unless you live in the neighborhood and walk there. With so many of these popular restaurants opening in The Gulch, Germantown, and throughout downtown, you'll need a parking strategy before you go.  We now describe many of our downtown restaurants by the condominium they anchor. Located on the southwest corner of Demonbreun and 3rd Avenue at the base of the Encore building, Bakersfield lies within the same SoBro structure that contains Yelp's #1 spot Etch and the #3 spot The Farm House. Now that's one heckuva building!  Restaurateur Luke McKee had planned to open Fulton's Tavern in this space but that fell through. So Bakersfield took over, originating in Cincinnati in 2012 and spreading to Columbus and Indianapolis. Ironically, it is named for the Bakersfield era of country music, a gritty alternative backlash to the slick Nashville production in the 1950s and 60s. Merle Haggard, God rest his soul, was part of that movement. New Bakersfield locations have been added in Charlotte and Pittsburgh, all locations containing wide picnic tables and concrete islands.  The marquee says ""Tacos Tequila Whiskey"" and they're not kidding. There isn't much more on the menu than that. Their specialty is street tacos (open-faced, soft-shelled, and smaller than what you might be used to). They run $4 each, and at only a few inches wide they're much more expensive per square inch than the masterpieces at Mas Tacos, but they pack a lot of flavor in that small space. This is definitely gourmet Mexican.  My favorite was certainly the mole, recommended by the server, named after the dark flavorful sauce it contains and stuffed with chicken and cheese. I was hesitant about the pickled red onion, but it perfectly complemented this taco! The crispy mahi taco was also good with a tabasco lime sauce. I enjoyed the bistec taco, but the steak was a bit chewy. The description of the pollo rojo sounded great on paper, but the chicken was very dry, perhaps the reason it was the only taco not recommended by the waiter. The pork belly taco was also extremely dry!  Chips and queso are highly recommended! The chips are way too salty, but the cheese is heavenly. This is not the cheap ballpark orange nacho cheese, nor is it the liquid mystery served at Moe's Southwest (admittedly addictive but probably not real cheese). Instead, the queso at Bakersfield is probably the best cheese and chips you'll find in this city. It is absolutely real cheese, packed with a wonderful array of spices with a fried skin across the top, a perfect 5-star concoction!  All in all, you will enjoy your visit here and won't be disappointed, but for the best tacos in town at a much cheaper price, I would go to Mas Tacos instead.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I moved to Broad Ripple Apartments 5 years ago. I was so excited to be living this close to an authentic Mexican restaurant. For four years I ate here by myself, with friends, and out side on the weekends with my dog at their tables. The restaurant recently expanded, I believe that at the same time they changed ownership. And so that is when and where the trouble began. In my previous visits, I was well attended, they knew my name, they treated me like family, always asking how I was doing, how my dog was things like that. When I had cancer two years ago, one of the waitresses would BRING me my food when she found out I was ill. But now, all of that has gone away. Several weeks ago I went in with friends and I ordered a club soda, all of my other friends ordered tea or cola. When the bills came I was charged almost $5 for my drink and all my friends were $2.50. When I asked about this they told me it was because my soda water came from the bar. Seriously?!?! That was the first time I was disappointed in this place, but it certainly has not been the last. The next time I came in for dinner with a friend an I ordered the steak taco platter. The little charcoal briquettes I got that was supposed to be meat was inedible. I sent it back and what they replaced it with was not much better. The next time I came in for breakfast by myself, I ordered the eggs benedict special. It was special all right. The grayish gloppy manure like sauce that was on top of my meal was disgusting. I had already waited almost an hour for my food anyway so I scraped off as much of that nastiness as I could and ate the breakfast. This was the first time I really complained and when I discovered that the ownership seems to have changed. I gave them another opportunity two weekends ago and that visit went well. The waitress was kind and attentive, refilled my coffee several times and fawned over my dog as we sat outside. Today, it was back to what seems to have become the norm for Biscuits. I sat outside for almost ten minutes before anyone even came outside, and then only because I went upfront to let them know I was there. None of the tables outside had been set up with silverware or anything. When the guy FINALLY came out to get my order, he didn't bring a menu. He brought me coffee and a water though. Once I ordered, my food came out rather quickly and it was ok except for the hashbrowns, seemed like they had been fried in the deep fryer. As I ate my breakfast I watched the world go by on the Monon trail, and this is one of the best parts about eating here outside, the ""scenery"" that runs by is beautiful ;-) As I continued my meal, no one came to check on me, my coffee was never refilled, and I had to wait almost 20 additional minutes for my check. The ONLY reason I got my check was because someone else came out to sit down. The guy that was serving me even TOLD me he forgot that I was out there. So I am officially done with this place. It has gone so far downhill that I refuse to give my money to a place that does not appreciate me as 1) a regular, and 2) as a customer at all.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"When we visited Suegra Saturday night it was with much anticipation.  We had read all the articles hyping the upscale farm to table ""authentic"" Mexican fare created by a James Beard award winning chef.  Has to be fantastic, right?  Mind blowing even.  The reality.  Way underwhelming.  And at almost $150 for two with tip, way over priced for the execution of the food.  So many other places in Tampa Bay for great and creative Mexican for far less money.  Having said that the restaurant just opened last week so it may be working on getting things right.  I can tell you we will not be back until they receive a ton of credible, positive reviews.  The Interior:  The interior is nice enough.  Not surprising since the investment to convert the former Cityfish over to Suegra is evident.  This is intended to be a big impact place.  Unfortunately they have several things to fix to get it right.  First, they need to pay more attention to their reservation integration with Open Table.  We had the option of selecting an outdoor or indoor table and selected the outdoor option.  We were seated at an indoor table nonetheless.  And the entire section we were in had incredibly poor lighting, causing us to have to use our phones to illuminate the menus.  The waiter apologized and told us they were aware and going to fix the issue.  The Food:  Our meal started with a complimentary trio of dips served in what appeared to be small pewter pots, served with tortilla chips.  The bean dip was touted as the star and it was.  Sort of a dip version of frijoles, or refried beans. Along with this was a red salsa that came with a warning that it was spicy and a green dip that was vaguely familiar.  The red salsa was good but far from spicy, even for the more timid.  The green dip reminded me of a weird variation of a tomatillo based salsa verde.  More on the sweet side and not spicy at all.  Over all the three dips were good.  For our appetizer we ordered the red snapper ceviche.  Now let me mention I love ceviche, my favorite being the Peruvian versions.  I have also had Mexican, Puerto Rican, Colombian, Spanish, and many Americanized versions of the dish.  What I have not had was a deconstructed version of the dish, until now.  It kind of worked.  Kind of.  The fish was fresh and by itself had very little flavor having been only slight marinated.  Most ceviches have seafood marinated in citrus, garlic and or onions, chilies, cilantro, etc.   In this case the ingredients were all separated on the plate.  The fish in one area, grilled avocado in another, sliced citrus in another, some cilantro leaves on top, and a couple habanero slices and a whole pepper rounding out the plate.  In order to get the flavor profile of a traditional ceviche one has to take a slice of each ingredient on the same fork.  Individually the ingredients were far less than the sum of their whole.  Overall not bad, but definitely not going to sway me from a great finished ceviche.  For our entrees I ordered a filet accompanied by a chipotle sauce.and my girlfriend ordered the chicken fajitas.  The quality of my filet was readily apparent and the only win on my plate.  I ordered it medium-rare and it was, tender, juicy, and with a better preparation the potential for a knockout.  Unfortunately it was served over two uninspiring flour tortillas and drowned in an absolutely cold, overly sweet, and thoroughly uninspiring brown sauce.  It reminded me of the interpretation of a mole sauce by someone definitely not of Mexican heritage.  I love chipotle peppers and cook with chipotle en adobo frequently.  This was awful and I would have to see it made to be convinced there was any chipotle included in the preparation.   I'm definitely not a fajita fan, but my girlfriend felt like this was worth a try.  The biggest miss on the chicken fajitas was the clunky cut of grilled chicken.  Since the concept of a fajita is basically a wrap, the slices of chicken should be conducive to that.  In this case it consisted of huge strips of unwieldy, chicken finger sized strips.  Beyond that it just wasn't very interesting.  Since the idea here is semi-a-la-carte we ordered a couple of sides, the Mexican Street Corn and plantains.  I wish we had asked more questions.  If you Google ""Mexican street corn"" you will be directed to dozens of hits on elote, an amazing Mexican version of grilled corn on the cob with crema, white cheese, and chili.  What we received was what happens when an American takes something magical and tries to one-up it to a complete failure.  A bowl of corn and other ingredients that just wasn't inspiring.  Worse yet all the sides were cold.  The plantains were served in a weirdly sweet brown sauce, like a bad platanos maduros.  Another bad sign was the table next us returned their entrees, so this was not a one off that night.  The best part of the entire meal was the $15 Picante Margarita, which was delicious if pricey.  Overall, massive miss.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I went there twice in January 2012 while in New Orleans for a convention. The first time was for supper on a Saturday evening; I went there mainly because it was nearby my hotel (the Embassy Suites) on Julia Street. As I recall, I was seated immediately, but, seemingly since I was by myself, I was ignored for about ten minutes. That gave me enough time to notice that the establishment was not very clean. Eventually, a server attended to me, at which time I ordered a beer (a Red Stripe, I believe). After looking at the menu -- and noticing just how very expensive all the entrees were, mostly over $20 -- I settled for a bowl of gumbo for $13. After a fairly short wait, the gumbo was thrown in front of me. Having had gumbo prepared by native Cajuns before, I found this gumbo to be heavy on flavourless broth. I was not impressed. This ""meal,"" with the $7 beer (even for an import, VERY expensive for New Orleans!) and automatically added 20% gratuity, came to $22. A few days later, a couple of friends/colleagues and I returned there for lunch; they insisted that they wanted to try Mulate's, so I reluctantly acquiesced after warning them that it was not at all up to the hype. This time, a lunch menu was available, if I recall correctly, and the prices were still very high. Unfortunately, this time, I was quite hungry, so I had to bite the bullet and order the muffaletta lunch, which included the muffaletta sandwich and fries. I also ordered a Red Stripe again. Overall, the portion sizes were small, and the food was very bland in flavour. It was particularly unimpressive when the bill came to $27. There is a place in Illinois where I attended university (known to be a bit on the expensive side) that has this exact lunch for $12 total. I cannot recommend Mulate's. They may have Zydeco bands playing there at night, but that same scene can be found countless other places in the city, including in the nearby French Quarter. As for food, if you're near the convention centre, there are Cajun ""fast food"" joints on the riverwalk just a couple of blocks away that offer more flavourful food/drink, larger portion sizes, and much cheaper prices than Mulate's. Go there. Or walk or take the trolley to the French Quarter.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Sylvain is the kind of bar/resto you'd be happy to come across in any city. It's hip, yet charming and quaint all at the same time. It helps that the food and cocktails match those vibes. It's not easy to walk in here and get a table though. This place has definitely been discovered, not only by a tourist or two stumbling upon it, given its proximity to Jackson Sq (as we did). So, in this scenario, we very happily sat ourselves at the bar. When a tourist in town, this gives you ideal access to knowledgeable bartenders for more recommendations.   Can't go wrong here with their take on the sazerac. I still think about the food we ate here, which came with enthusiastic and genuine endorsements from quirky bartender (i'm still not sure he actually worked there). Field peas on toast with ricotta...sounds simple, truly refreshing. My sister and I shared the beef cheeks entree, which we were told is divine, and it was. The kitchen even prepared two separate plates for us since we were sharing (no, we didn't ask for that). Now that's the kind of service I like, attentive.

"My fiance and I dined there for dinner during restaurant week. Here are the low lights:      - Our waitress disappeared a lot,      - My steak, ordered medium, came out raw (it was purple, not even close),      - When my steak came back it was extremely seared (burnt on outside, still raw),      - My wine glass was dirty: food bits and particles on the outside      - The lobster bisque was really, really bland      - Crème brûlée wasn't caramelized on top  The mashed potatoes we had were really, really good. The suggested wine paring with my fiance's filet mignon was perfect. We dined on a Monday so it was quiet and more intimate.  I went with 2 stars because it wasn't awful, I was just really disappointed. If I had paid full price instead of the restaurant week prices I would be more upset.

"Love this place!!  I've been here a thousand times! Ok... Maybe more like 50... But I'll be back! I always do lunch, never tried them for dinner. I appreciate the fact that they have a really yummy skinny menu with calorie count.  The Ahi Tuna dishes are all fab. The smaller one is really small... Nothing to share. The tuna carpaccio is a bit bigger and the entree Ahi Tuna Salad is big! Sometimes they are a bit stingy on the avocado but I have always gotten some more upon request (I guess those extra calories are included too ha ha).  You get two kinds of baguettes to nibble on before food, they are both good.   If you like something bigger I would recommend their monster burrito, it could feed a small country. Really flavorful too!  The service is always really good (expect one time, but we got an excuse and a gift card to make up for it). They have a very nice lady managing/greeting you upfront, sorry don't have her name... But she's been working the last 4-5 times I have visited.

"Perhaps reviews were so bad that this location has been removed from Yelp. As stated in a previous review, the issues here do not start or end with the product, but all in its Management.   Now, this is my second negative review here. Based to a past unacceptable experience I was thoughtfully credited with a voucher for a large Pizza. Not living nearby, could not redeem to over a year later. On a slower Sunday night attempted to redeem the voucher only to realize that it expired. Explaining to the Manager that the last several trips were underwhelming and we lived 3.5hrs south he sternly stated it was too late to redeem and he would not honor.   Here's the deal, if someone is willing to come back, and the only reason was the pizza is good, you should work with them. That he didn't show changes have been made their legacy is now cemented .  So, since the overwhelming negative Yelp reviews are now deleted, here is what the past looked like:  When the GSR is busy, expect long waits up to and usually over an hour. Expect the premises to be unkempt, downright dirty, with many patrons bussing their own tables. Expect the Buffet to have undercooked Pizza and be out of most things. Expect the salad bar to look so sloppy you'll hesitate to put any of it on your plate. Expect the staff to use foul language just out of site from customers. Expect a lack of humility from their supervision, versus a tactic of confrontation which did not change with my last visit here. Expect that you will rather eat at Johnny Rockets because they at least have good service and are staffed accordingly. In my previous review I made it clear that these were not only my experiences, but witnessed feedback from many other patrons over all of the visits here. Even witnessed in 2016 a patron and a Supervisor yelling at each other to the point the patron was so angry he threatened to come back with help. Had the whole place staring in horror.   Here's the deal, if you have kids and must eat here, just call down and order it to go, show up when the pizza may be ready and be willing to still wait awhile. Then if you're lucky enough to find a clean table just sit down. Better yet, take it out to the remodeled pool area and do it right.   If you read this your best bet is order Pizza off property and either have it delivered or go pick it up. You'll save yourself a bunch of grief.   To the Round Table team who petitioned to have their reviews removed please keep something in mind, word of mouth is also a powerful tool that can affect business. Anybody I talk to I make sure to tell them to stay far away.

But that is not what makes this place the best hole in the wall place to eat in Edwardsville.    It's all about the belly bombs, or at least, what they used to call the belly bombs.  Three small burgers, the perfect meat to cheese ratio, an order of their uniquely seasoned fries, and of course the ice cream.  But if you are more hungry, there's the Okie Burger, the Pizza Burger, Charco Burgers, fried cauliflower, and so much more to fill your tummy!    I'm telling you, if in the Edwardsville area, this is a place you want to look up.  It is closed a few months every year for the cold weather, so make sure you head over before the winter months hit us.  I promise you, this is the best little secret in town!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Not a bad local Mexican joint, but wasn't a huge fan of the burrito. Flavors were a bit bland, chicken was dry, and prices were average.

A little indoor seating and their carry out service is pretty quick if that's your preference.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

There was like one friend flauta or something on the menu.  They also gave us a sonoran hot dog but without any of the special toppings.  It was a huge let down.

"I love BK Tacos! This location is always busy, but they have a good amount of seating and really keep things moving. The menu is a great mix of tacos, burros, sonoran dogs, quesadillas, and more - there's really something for everyone here, including combos that come with a side/drink. I always get a traditional sonoran dog here and absolutely love them - great bun, delicious layers of flavor, good price. I love the option of the salsa/toppings bar in the middle - you can load up on cheese, onions, salsas, etc. - all very fresh and super delicious for customizing your tacos/burros/dogs. Last time we visited, I enjoyed a super yummy piece of Tres Leches cake for my birthday - it was so creamy and delicious. Inside, you'll find a fun atmosphere with music videos (always fun and upbeat!) and lots of hungry patrons - kind of like a sports bar. A great option for a fun dinner with friends or a super casual date night. Totally recommend! Pro Tip: They make a fantastic margarita here, too!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I enjoyed the beer options and price points. The options for meat platters are expansive, which is a definite plus. I found the brisket to be fantastic, whereas my husband liked the ribs. Cornbread was tasty as were the sweet potato fries. Didn't care much for the collards- they arrived cold and were tasteless. The coleslaw was just alright/ maybe needed more acid? The best dish was a chicken sandwich which I shared with my hubby. It was excellently prepared, moist, and packed with flavor.   Didn't much care for the bathroom situation. It was far away- way downstairs and the door was difficult to lock. Also no mirror.  Either way, this place has a lot going for it- just needs some consistency with food delivery- temperature, and flavor as well as a more centrally located bathroom with fewer steps to get to.

"Terrible. I popped in this morning for a quick breakfast after working all night as a nurse. I ordered a breakfast sandwich to go, and then had to ask not once but twice for a glass of water. There was seating in the back so I sat myself while waiting. After about 5 minutes, the cashier delivered my sandwich that I was going to eat while in a rush. A couple of minutes later, another employee told me that this was for ""table service"" only. No sorry about that, just there is seating in the courtyard which if by that you mean the two rickety tables out front, sire. I also paid $7 for a burnt cruissant with no flavor.

This was the 2nd time i visited B.good and it was not a good experience.  Ordered a turkey burger on a gluten free bun (good option that they offer) and an order of sweet potato fries.  The fries were completely burnt and the turkey burger was very small and didn't fit the bun but it could be that the gluten free bun is bigger than a usual bun.  My 1st visit was much better.

"I wanted to love this place. I envisioned wonderful fluffy donuts. Real eggs great crispy bacon and cheddar all on a fluffy glazed donut. NOT!!  What I got instead was a flat grease logged cake donut with a pre fab egg round and three stringy half cooked pieces of cheap bacon and a greasy half on half off piece of American cheese. All dressed up in a very expensive looking box. Sorry to say but this place would get zero stars if that were possible. As far as cleanliness goes its new so the usual grease on fixtures hasn't had time to set in, but my feet were sticking to the floor and it was only 9am. The employees were all super nice and all were good looking kids just what the customer would expect. But their aprons were filthy, and that is being generous. The whole process of dipping 12 different donuts in 12different glazed different toppings etc seems like a disaster and an operational nightmare.

"A very paradoxical dinner experience: Over priced and under cooked. Go figure.   The market bar (something or other) starts off at 12.99 and escalates rapidly as you add a protein into the mix. I ended up paying $15 for a plate of highly spicy and overly salted entree--something I could have done on my own at home. The beef was extremely over done, while the veggies was drastically under cooked.   As for the service: the sauce selection area was not being refilled on the regular. I stood at there for about five minutes waiting for someone to come over so I can tell them about the almost empty sauce container. The First Lady I talk to walks away. The second man that I talk to asks me twice what I needed. He finally understands what I'm trying to say. He proceeds to take my sauce bowl, removes the ladle in the sauce container, and dumps the entire leftover contents into my sauce bowl. Mind you, I DIDN'T need that much sauce--and this caused for a very overly salted and spicy entree. I paid $15 for this dish, and at the very least I deserve to have freshly refilled sauce.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

After receiving a plate of lettuce with 3 small grilled chicken strips and a sprinkle of cheese, I inquired about the additional toppings. I was informed that they are out of everything else.

"I think this might be the best place I have been to in Reno. I heard about the place and decided to pick something up during my lunch hour. I got a philly sandwich and thought it might be worth a try. After tax and tip it was maybe $15, so not too bad. I get there and they were just a bit behind, so after maybe twenty seconds of sitting they came and gave me chicken noodle soup for free, and by the way it was fantastic. They give me this huge bag that I knew couldn't just be a sandwich. I open it up and it came with a free side and even a piece of cake. It was easily one of the best sandwiches I have had. I have now been there for breakfast twice now and each time is better than the last.

We had a waitress whom we have had before and as always, she was attentive but not overbearing. We weren't ready to order entrees off the bat because we weren't sure how full we would be until after we had finished the first course. She was totally fine with that and didn't rush us to make a decision. As per usual, the meatballs and polenta were the star of the evening. The beet salad was a close second favorite but everything we had was great. I with the garlic bread came with a bit more garlic, that last few times we've gotten it we have felt like its a lot of bread and not a lot of garlic (can you ever get enough roasted garlic in your life though?).

"The atmosphere at Resurrection is great, which makes me wish the food was better.  The beer list was also excellent.  The food, however, left something to be desired.  Mainly, it was way salty.  You can add salt, but you can't take it back, and both the appetizers and entrees had too much.  The pork in particular was drenched in salt.  The service was good, but not amazing, however there was one waitress working (I think) all of the tables on a relatively quiet night, so that didn't have a major bearing on my rating, as I understand having to work all those tables is tough.  Conclusion: the menu was only mildly impressive and the way over seasoned.  Since it's very close, I'll probably try Resurrection again, but given my grad school budget, I can't guarantee it, since if I'm going to for a slightly more ""upscale"" American meal, I want to really love it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This is by far the WORST customer service I have seen in years!!! Today was my sister's birthday, and I came early to get a good table. The waitress (an older Asian lady. I don't know her name) gave us a table next to the entrance. I asked for another one that was farther away and more private and she said no because that was for six people and we were four (there was hardly anyone there. It was 2:20pm in the afternoon). She insisted that we keep the table she recommended, which was next to the two other patrons eating. Ok, I gave in.   Then we ordered, and I got the Green Curry Thai with beef. Well it barely came with any beef at all. To their credit, my sister's dish came out with enough chicken instead. Well I asked that same waitress for  more meat, but she said that it would cost me an extra charge. I explained to her that I barely got any meat and was wondering if they could give me more. She said that she couldn't get more unless I paid an extra charge. The extra charge was not that much, but I became upset at her rudeness. In the end, I just wanted to pay and leave this place. However, I wasn't going to leave her a tip. Not after this kind of customer service.   Then the bill came and the old Asian waitress brought her ipad and she wanted me to fill out a form that asked to put in my gratuity. She stood right behind me the entire time, I guess to intimidate me into putting a generous tip. But I didn't! I did not leave a tip at all. Then she started yelling, in front of everyone, that I didn't leave her a tip since I paid $74 for everyone (by then there were new customers). And then she stared at us the entire time as we walked to the parking lot.  So what kind of a place is this??? What kind of customer service is this??? I get to pay $14 aprox for a dish that barely comes with any meat, then the waitress argues with me and refuses to accomodate me and then DEMANDS that I leave her a gratuity? I think by far this is the worst place I've been. Of all my reviews, this is by far the worst so far. Maybe its just the waitress? Are the others any better? I don't know as this was my first time coming to this place, and probably my last. My sister was not too happy with her dish as she said that the sauce was too watery and bland, unlike at other Thai places.

"I've lived in Holiday for 18 years and never tried this place. Now I know why...  Out shopping on a rainy Saturday with my wife and we were getting hungry. She suggested trying the Americana 50's Diner because we've never eaten there and because the parking lot seems to always be full (a good sign or so we thought).  Another reviewer said it perfectly. It starts with a parking lot that is full of potholes...large potholes that can't be seen in the rain. Should have been a clue but we went in anyway. The place was not clean at all. We noticed food on the blinds, broken tiles on the wall and dirty floors. Just a few of the many things we noticed. As the other reviewer said, the owner was wearing a dirty, food covered and stained polo shirt. The staff was friendly but slow and inattentive. The food took way to long to come out for what we ordered.  My wife ordered a bacon cheese burger...came with fries and soup. the soup (beef barley) came out immediately and I thought it was pretty good. My wife didn't like it. She  likes her bacon crispy but it was under cooked and floppy, also very greasy. She didn't specifically ask for crispy bacon so we'll let that one go. She stated the burger was just average tasting with that fake, processed yellow cheese on it. It came on a kaiser roll that was almost twice as big as the patty was. She did like the fries. Her review of the burger was 1 out of 5 stars. I ordered the Irish omelette with grits and wheat toast. The omelette was tasteless and barely warm. No amount of salt and pepper could help. The grits were dry and chunky, nothing like the wonderful creamy grits my wife makes. I will say that the wheat toast was good but I hope you like lots of butter like I do because it was almost swimming in it. 0 out of 5 stars.  Finally, when we left, the woman at the cash register (I'm guessing the owner's wife) didn't ask if we liked our meal or enjoyed our experience (another clue), she just stated, ""Have a nice day"".  All in all I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. It was one of the worst all around establishments that I've ever encountered.   As the other reviewer stated just go to Great Subs and More across the street. The food is MUCH better. I suggest their Great Steak sub all the way, and/or their gyro. Both are excellent!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I love the food and atmosphere here - my favorite dish is the chicken in phyllo - it's amazing, as are the beautiful carrots that accompany it.  What really prompted me to write a review is my latest experience. I'm currently on the HCG weight loss plan (through Tucson Medical Weight Loss - definitely worth a plug too!). I was heading downtown recently with some friends to see Roger Clyne at the Rialto, and they wanted to dine at 47 Scott - of course!  Being on a special diet, I called ahead to see what they could do, since the standard menu is pretty limited (not a complaint - a small number of wonderful dishes is much better than pages and pages of pedestrian stuff!).  I called in the afternoon and Travis, co-owner and chef, answered the phone himself -score! I explained my situation, and he very patiently discussed my limited choices with me, congratulated me for being on such a healthy diet, and got me set up for a wonderful meal. They made sure my special request was noted for the reservations that had already been made.  When I arrived, my server already knew I would be getting something special off menu. I felt like royalty! And so, even though I envied my friends who were drinking wine and eating mussels and 47 Scott's wonderful ciabatta bread with olive oil and fresh mozzarella, and wonderful French fries fried in peanut oil, my special meal arrived and I was ecstatic! Travis, who was also cooking that night, had fixed me a beautiful, hand trimmed New York strip steak, lightly seasoned with rosemary and other herbs and cooked with no oil (as is his usual way), plus some wonderfully seasoned and roasted asparagus (made special just for me!). I enjoyed every bite, and was able to take half my steak home to enjoy the next day with my lunch.  It was delicious and I didn't feel like the odd man out at all!  So, whether you have special diet needs or not, 47 Scott is the place to be downtown. If you do have special diet needs, please call ahead and ask to speak to Travis or one of the other chefs so they can accommodate you. I know Travis really appreciated my calling ahead instead of waiting until I arrived to make my special requests.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This is absolutely authentic Mexican... Not just the food. As soon as you walk in you are in Mexico. Complete with unfinished construction and chairs that were designed by someone who has never actually sat in one of them. Tons of seating. If you plan to stay and talk, lean forward in the chair to avoid back pain. The decor is not Mexican style, it is Mexican. I'm sure everything in here including the tile and the light fixtures actually came from Tijuana. I've been in 50 restaurants south of the border that are exactly like this. Same chairs. The food is quite good and the portions are monstrous. The salsa bar is limited. That's actually how they do it in Mexico too. They don't try to give you everything you could ever imagine, they just serve up the things they like.  In a town where there are so many fabulous options for Mexican flavor, it's hard to give this place more than a 3. But the food is really good and you won't be disappointed. Super friendly people. Good parking.  Still a little speck of the funk zone that hasn't been taken over by commercial money.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We found this restaurant via yelp (of course), and ate there 7/12/14 & 7/20/14.  The service was impeccable, the decor was cozy and charming. The owner, who was the cook, visited with us after our meal, and was quite aware of his yelp rating, and extremely proud of it. We liked this restaurant SO MUCH that on our way BACK home the following week we returned for lunch. Everything we had was excellent. Over the 2 meals we had chicken chimichangas,  Diablo burrito, the combination fajitas, the combo with taco, chili relleno,&  enchilada and then a new dish for us... the #13, Birria. Seriously, how have I missed Birria all my life?!?! I have since found a recipe and plan on making it. And also, HOW do you improve on a taco, which they did??  The portions weren't quite as large as some Mexican restaurants, but the quality was definitely some of the best I have ever had. I'd say it was on par with the Mexican restaurants I've eaten at in San Antonio and Galveston, and better than anywhere else.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"My wife (who is Lebanese) and I came here for lunch one day expecting some authentic Lebanese food, but as soon as we walked in we saw the Egyptian decor and then had a look at the menu and had already decided this restaurant had very little to do with Lebanese cuisine. Nonetheless we decided to give it a try and sat ourselves... We waited for a couple minutes before any server approached us, we literally watched about four of them huddled around the cash register deciding who was going to take our table (we were very casually dressed and probably passed for college students in their mind). Bad start...  For appetizers we ordered the Halloumi cheese plate which was a great starter... And we also ordered the feta cheese & olive plate (which to my wife's surprise was served without pita bread). When she asked if we could get some pita bread to eat the feta cheese and olives with, she was almost shunned by the server for asking such a thing, and she then seemed to reluctantly deliver. Strike two.   My wife ordered the lamb kabob plate which was highly recommended from my middle eastern friends, and I must say I can't imagine there is anything better on the menu it was fantastic! Definitely one of the few bright moments in our dining experience. I ordered the combination kabob plate which comes with chicken kabob, beef shish kabob, and lula kabob (ground lamb with herbs & spices). I asked the server if I could pay to substitute the Lula kabob with Lamb kabob, and she went in the back to ask the chef/owner and came back to tell me that they could not make that substitute (strike three)! I wasn't very impressed with the combination plate and wished I had just ordered the lamb kabob plate. However at least the salad and hummus were enjoyable.  By the time we were finished with our meal the restaurant had filled up quite a bit since our arrival... We kind of got the sense that this place does high volume with a low level of service. The entire time we could hear the chef in the kitchen barking orders in Arabic and yelling at employees in English. Overall, very disappointed with our experience. Perhaps the owner should consider renaming the restaurant Cairo's cafe... We will not be going back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Meh...was hoping this place would be as good as the First Watch in green hills. Love the grab n go concept, but it was much like airport grab n go. I ordered the chicken tortilla salad to go because the ones in the case had brown avocados. I also asked for no feta. Love cheese, but feta ain't my fav. When I opened my salad later, no avocado on mine.  I mean a $13 salad and just corn, beans lettuce and cold sliced chicken? Not cool. The dressing was too sweet and tangy for me. Chick fila has a better to go salad and half the price. Chunks of the base of the romaine head, too. Very disappointing.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I had the Voodoo juice which was so tasty but potent. I thought the price was pretty expensive ($19) for one drink, but it actually was pretty good.   Moving on to the food. The food was pretty bland. My group tried the crab dip which was cold and seemed to be unseasoned. Although crawfish season was done, I decided to try the crawfish po boy.

Several minutes after our orders were taken, our waitress LEFT - without a warning, and without having someone else assigned to our table. Then, we watched as others, who were seated after us, received their food. It was only after I complained that someone FINALLY brought us our food, which had been sitting for quite some time.

"This review is for BREAKFAST ONLY.  I have been here for lunch before (a few years ago), and it was good (though not especially memorable).  Went for breakfast on a lazy Saturday morning; it was not too crowded, we were one of only 4 or 5 tables.  We ordered one eggs benedict, a ham and cheese omelet and a pork roll benedict (pork roll instead of canadian bacon - genius!).  Unfortunately when the food came out, the omelet was not fluffy, rather rubbery, with too much ham and too little cheese.  Quite sad.  On both of the benedicts the poached eggs were cooked way beyond the point of having any yolk run out when pierced.  The hollandaise was just ok - it was a good consistency but didn't have that nice little tang that a great hollandaise does.  However, the breakfast potatoes were great!  Perfectly seasoned, perfectly sized little chunks of potato (the size is key so you get the right crispy exterior to potatoey interior ratio rather than having potatoes that are quartered or hash browns that are soggy).  Service was just fine, a little absentee for how not busy it was, but the place is very diner-like for breakfast, so what can you expect?  Nevertheless, I would still like to give dinner here a try sometime.  The menu was a little more well developed than when we had been here for lunch, and they have a few great beers tapped and bottled beer but you can also bring your own wine, which I find very interesting.  They also have a really nice outdoor seating section.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

No one was taking names, no one came over and said we will be with u in a few minutes, workers just kept walking by as if we were t even there.

Went back to my family who were still on line with not much to say.   Finally they sat two tables and we were next, at least I think we were.   Again we waited, no welcome, no we will be right with you and it was hot.

"Hit and miss. I've gone here for years, because it is a good burger. Sort of. They seem to have issues with matching the right bun size to the patty size. For a while, the 8oz burger would come on such a small bun that the patty had to be too thick to actually bite into.   I went recently for the first time in a while and got the 6oz burger. I was pleased to see a large bun, but then...I was blown away when I opened it up to see a nearly round patty, no more than 3 or 4 inches in diameter. Seriously, I could have trimmed 1 1/2 inches of bun all the way around the patty. WHY? Why make a patty so thick, and so small?   Service is always questionable.

The server was extremely friendly and welcoming. He was very attentive to our needs. Their menu is geared towards people that want pizza. They have some other things on their menu but it didn't seem like they focused on non pizza menu items. I just got a simple pepperoni pizza and my mom got a chicken and jalepeno pizza.

"Usually, I love IHOP, but this location is the worst!  I visited here yesterday, late-morning, on a whim with my aunt.  The last time we went to this location, which we'd both totally forgotten about until little instances began reminding us, my aunt had been served a stack of pancakes with a scoop of scrambled eggs on it instead of butter.  It wouldn't melt, obviously, and when my aunt went to try and spread it, we realized it was scrambled eggs.  The waitress kept trying to convince us otherwise and held tight to her belief that it was, in fact, butter....but promised to bring my aunt more!  It was ridiculous and frustrating.  Clearly, it was eggs and she wouldn't just admit it and apologize on behalf of the kitchen staff.  Yesterday's visit wasn't much better.  Upon arriving, I asked if a woman had just come in by herself asking for a table for two.  The young woman at the host stand responded, ""Two?!"", as she grabbed two menus and began looking for an open table.  I repeated my question and she pointed me to the only corner of the restaurant not visible from the door.  As I zig-zagged my way through the crowded seating area, I noticed that the table she was seated at didn't even appear to be clean.  As I sat down, I realized that it hadn't been wiped.  The server, who was delivering a glass of water to my aunt as I was approaching, asked for my drink order at time.  I ordered coffee and noticed that he was chewing on a broken toothpick.  Yuck!  He returned with a mug and the entire carafe of coffee, which he left there, I imagine to avoid having to return to check on us.  The table already had sweetener and creamer in a bowl, so this worked for me.  I also asked for a glass of water, which he brought as well.  The water, which I finished about halfway through our visit, never got refilled.  To be honest, the waiter seemed completely clueless.  Tables around us, who seemed to have a better rapport with the waiter, would speak to him while he was trying to help us and he would become very distracted.  My aunt ordered pancakes with sausage and hashbrowns along with a small glass of milk.  The server asked if 2% would be okay and she confirmed that it would.  I ordered a cup of loaded potato soup and a house salad, no tomato with ranch dressing.  I also asked to add shredded cheese.  When the order came out, my salad, which should've come with red onion, had huge chunks of raw, white onion on it.  When I told him that it was supposed to be red onion, he initially responded that they didn't have any.  Then, after seeing my facial expression, he revised his statement and began forming a circle by cupping his hands together.  He said, ""well, they do have it....it's just big.""  I believe he was trying to saying that it hadn't been sliced.  I asked him to request sliced red onion for my salad because I was not about to eat raw, white onion on mine.  The salad also had a ridiculous amount of shredded cheese atop it.  The proportion to the amount of salad greens was way off.  Once he returned with red onion (rather quickly, in fact) I chopped my salad and there was a ton of cheese layering the bottom of the bowl.  I tasted my soup, and since it was already lukewarm, I chose to eat it immediately.  After which, I decided to just take the salad home.    When the waiter returned with our bill, I asked for a box for my salad and a lid for my dressing cup.  My aunt asked for the milk that she never received.  He apologized, stating that we hadn't been charged for it and after offering us both other beverages to make up for it, my aunt stated that she just wanted the milk.  He returned with it and forgot the box.  It took another 10-15 minutes before I saw him again to request it a second time.  He didn't recall me having asked at all.  The level of service here is poor and the food is basic.  I will not return to this particular location.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

My next drink was the weekend warrior which was a sweet tea drink. It was a smooth drink but lacked the amount of alcohol I'd hoped. The bread was good and brought to our table.

"Whoa! What I thought was going to be a quick, informal meal turned into one of the best dining experiences I've had in New Orleans. First off, a shout out to Debayan, the best server EVER. Somehow he got the orders for six of us all right, making recommendations and answering our questions about unfamiliar food as we talked out of turn, changed our minds, and added items with abandon. And he did it all with a smile.  On to the food. We got corn fritters and empanadas for the table. They were delicious and I loved the light orange buttery spread that came with them. I ordered the Buenaventura arepa, filled with shrimp, chorizo, and grilled onions and peppers. The shrimp was so fresh I wondered if they have their own tiny bayou out back! I also got Maiz de la Ruida, grilled corn on the cob with seasoned butter, cotija cheese, and sauce that was so good I took somebody else's leftover home with the half I couldn't eat. We also split a piece of tres leches cake and flan. Tres leches is usually just cake to me, but this one was special.

"Gitto's on the Hill felt like a hustle from start to finish.  I didn't feel like any of the waitstaff (the overzealous water boy excluded - bless his heart) was interested in our comfort or enjoyment.    We were meeting another couple there and were invited to sit at the bar.  Great idea if you like to get bumped and knocked, as the Gitto's bar is more or less an extension of the maitre d stand.  The bartenders were rude and were pressuring us to pay the bill before we even had a sip of our drinks nor knew when the other couple was going to arrive.  One bartender even said ""I'm listening"" when we gave him his order when he was doing 19 other things and not even remotely looking in our direction.  The maitre D snapped at me for asking if he was aware that the other party had arrived.  Finally, the maitre D ""motioned"" that our table was ready. One member of our party was a senior and they acted like it would take a crane to get him to his table.  If we are not moving fast enough for them it's because of the rickety bar stools and the tight-squeeze bar arrangement.  When we were finally seated, the waiter did not seem to care about our initial complaint that the A/C was blowing right on us on a 61-degree day.  No offer to turn it down or to move us.  I had to go out to my car and get a wool shirt *and* a sport coat.  Great for the waiters to be cool when they're working ... horrible for the patrons who have to endure sub arctic conditions and woof down hot food that has A/C blowing on it as fast as possible.    They had Sunday specials which weren't all that cheap considering Sunday is a hard night for restaurants.  But the waiter dissed the Sunday specials ""soup Nazi style"" and made you feel chintzy for ordering them.  The waiter hustled one of our party for a second drink in the most-cheezy fashion.  If you don't order dessert they whisk the dessert menus out of your hand contemptuously.    The waiter put his arms around us in the most phony of fashions ""to tell us how happy he was we spent our special occasion"" with them.    I could tell tip-time was nearing!  We tipped 15% but not on the tax.  The waiter glared at us through the iron grates as we walked on the sidewalk back to our car.  The food was pretty good but this experience drove home the fact that the food can be wonderful but if the service makes you feel uncomfortable, you wont enjoy it.   And by the way, as far as classy is concerned, the hoosiers in St. Louis have gotten the message that Gittos is the place to wear your shorts,  tubetop dresses, sweatsuits, blue jeans and baseball caps.

"We loved Rasa Sayang!  On our way up the 95 from Baltimore we stopped by this weekend and it was so good we stopped back by on our way back down.    The food here is authentic and flavorful.  Not just one flavor, but a depth of flavors and that's just what we look for in our Malaysian food.  Both times we kicked it off with the Roti bread.  We've lived in India, so we know a good roti when we eat one... and this was tops!  Our 4 year old begged us for it the 2nd time before walking in the door.    The Mango Salad was delicious.  It was a in a slaw form similar to papaya salad but with mango, carrot, and onions. Sweet and tangy.  The salad was surrounded by glazed grilled chicken which was moist and flavorful.   The mango chicken was delishious with lots of fresh flavor.  The bonus was being served in the mango skin.  We asked for ""spicy.""  It had a nice kick without masking the flavors.  The pad thai was nice a moist.  Sweet, and full of meat.  The same for the pineapple fried rice.    The Chay Koay Teow (Malaysian Pasta) was authentic and just what you'd find walking through a food market in Malaysia.    The Sea Bass Green Curry was the piece de resistance.  The fish was perfectly cooked.  The depth of flavor to the green curry sauce was amazing.  I closed my eyes to enjoy the individual flavors of coconut, ginger, and basil harmonizing in my mouth.  I treat myself only once every few years to sea bass due to its scarcity and I'm sure glad this was the place I gave into my sea bass hunger.  Dessert wise we had the mango fusion and the fried ice cream.  The mango fusion was good.  It's mango sticky rice with extra coconut milk sauce all topped with mango sorbet.  It was nice and my husband liked it.  To me, I like my sticky rice hot so sorbet on top was not my thing.  The fried ice cream really was fried.  I've had it where it's rolled in corn flakes, but never actually fried.  Believe it or not, it was light and every bite left you wanting a little more.  The fried ice cream was served with a fried banana was perfectly fried that it held its flavor and shape.    As we left our 4 year old said ""my stomach as never felt like this before.""  Yep... that's the feeling of stuffing your tummy with yummy kiddo!  We've all agreed this will be a regular I-95 stop.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I had never been here before and I must say I was very excited to try a new restaurant, even though I know it's been here for a while! I tried this place for lunch the day I left for my trip and about half way through my trip I found myself craving it so it was the first meal I had when I came back! Hooray for delicious Mexican food in YEG! I love the atmosphere, it's fun and chill and they let you drink a beer or glass of sangria while waiting to place an order! It's almost like a cafeteria style but the food is brought to your table and is way better than any cafeteria! Both times I've had the fish tacos and I must say they are some of the best I've ever had, the only place that beats them is located in Hawaii, which is substantially closer to the ocean. The staff are extremely friendly and I find the food reasonably priced! The portions are pretty big, the boyfriend and I shared one order and just added an extra taco so that there were 2 for each of us and then ordered the chips and salsa. I didn't finish all of mine, thankfully the boyfriend was there to help out! I will definitely be back, I'm so excited they are opening another location on 104st and I'm stoked to try out their patio!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Green Eggs Café, thank you so much for not judging me when I walked straight into your doors after a long night on call, disheveled and in need of coffee and eggs.   Crème Brule Latte: Too sweet and almost too smoky, got this iced, I wonder if it would have been less overwhelming if had hot.   Chicken and Waffles Benedict: The waffle here was a-amazing. Fluffy and perfectly sweet. My issue was the chicken- the texture was fine but it had no flavor and no crunch. Combined with the eggs and hollandaise sauce, both of which were good, the dish was overall squishier than I was expecting.   Seems good for groups if you don't mind a wait.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

We went because someone gave us a gift certificate but will be happy to pay next time.  We got one vegetarian paella and one with meat.  Both were full of flavor though obviously in very different way.  We also ordered the Brussels sprouts (very good) and stuffed ourselves with bread (excellent) so we ended up taking food home with us. But doggie bags are a good thing in my book.

"Not really sure how to rate this place as the decor/ambience was nice but because we were in a bit of a rush, we were served something different than what we ordered which was disappointing. We didn't feel we had the time to wait for what we ordered to be served so we dealt with it. Plus it was served cold which certainly kills the anticipation of a fine meal. And to top things off, our dessert order got lost and had to be reordered by the server causing an additional 25 minute delay. The server did an excellent job and perhaps on another night it would have been a better experience for us.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"On our first visit to New Orleans we dined at Bayona based on a friend's recommendation who visits the city frequently, and a write-up in Southern Accents magazine. The weather was wonderful, so we asked to dine in the courtyard. We ordered a lovely bottle of wine only to find out 10 minutes later that they didn't have it in their cellar -- our substitute arrived after another 10 minutes. Our wine was poured and we placed our meal order -- only to be told that our first choice of starters and entrees were not available.  Finally, 10 minutes later the bread was placed on the table. Then,  20 minutes later our first course arrived which was delicious, so we decided to forgive the slow service. So much for forgiveness ... it took another 20 minutes for the second course to arrive. Again, absolutely delicious, but by then we were ""over"" the extremely slow service. Still, we thought we would try desert. We placed our desert order, and again, another 20 minutes. As with the other courses it was delicious. Unlike the service up to this point the bill arrived promptly, and with news that the desert would be complimentary due to ... the slowness of it's arrival (SURPRISE). We will definitely be back to New Orleans, just not sure if we'll dine at Bayona again. In total, our dinner experience was 2hrs + long at a slow dining time for the restaurant. I would hate to experience the service when it's busy. In summary, the food was superb, staff was friendly, but the kitchen too slow to warrant our return.

The decor inside is nice but the service can improve. Every time I try to sit at the bar, it's too full so I end up at a table. It's slow to get your sushi and then to get your server to come back, which is understandable when doing AYCE and sitting at a table. I do get to-go sushi quite a bit and the price goes up for that, which is also annoying. Other than that, it's a great restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I was originally trying to satisfy my craving for sushi. Somehow I had incorrect information, and found Nala instead. Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of Indian food, but I do like Thai, so I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the massaman curry with chicken and Thai ice tea to go. The gentleman who helped me was SO very nice and friendly. I shared with him how I don't like spicy at all, so he made sure my massaman was super mild. He told me it would be a 15 minute wait and offered me a seat at one of the tables, even if I wasn't dining in. He also asked if I wanted a water or any other drink while I wait. I didn't take the offer, but very considerate.  Satisfied with the service I received inside the restaurant, I was looking forward to try my food. Large portion of curry, includes a side of rice and some sort of pudding for dessert. Apparently they don't have to-go cups for drinks, though, because my Thai iced tea came in one of those plastic soup containers, but they did throw in a small coffee cup, lid, and straw. They must not do to-go very often or well because I also didn't have any utensils in the bag. Or napkins. Eh.  The food itself was good. Mild as promised, but still with taste. The pudding wasn't anything extraordinary, but it was good. The Thai tea, though... very disappointing! It had a really weird taste to it, as if the milk was spoiled. Yikes! Or maybe not spoiled, but whatever milk they used, I'm not a fan. At all.  So, great service. Average food. Not so good to-go abilities.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Key words: delivery, chicken tinga, fat bits, no green sauce.  We had our first meal delivered.  It was just okey to our standards.  I got the chicken Tinga burrito which was tasty but all of the chicken was at the bottom of the burrito.  My husband got the carnitas tostada and found chopped up bits of straight up fat which was unappetizing and unedible.   We also ordered green sauce but, unfortunately the entire order of sauce opened up and leaked into the plastic bag. Now, you would think that this is a one time thing but even the delivery guy said this happens often bc of the packaging.  He felt bad and gave us back $2 which is more than what we paid for that sauce.    Maybe if we had sauce, this would be a 4 star review but probably not.

"Atmosphere: Chain-like contemporary. All hard surfaces. Paper placemats with menus printed on them, for those of you who want to relive your days as a kid dining at your family's favorite place on the interstate. Slightly elevated bar to one side. The noise level is normal for a CBD venue.  Service: Excellent. The waiter explained dishes and was attentive throughout.  Food: The calamari app is actually a calamari steak, although the menu does not say this. You get a lot of squid on the plate, so be prepared. The sauce and fresh lemon were really nice.   The margherita pizza was a disaster, with no fresh mozzarella or tomatoes anywhere to be seen. Instead, a few swipes of sauce and some sort of cheese were painted onto the dry crust, producing a very strange dish. It was topped with the least amount of basil I have ever seen on a pizza. I was going to send it back, but I figured that it wouldn't get any better. The dish as served does not look anything like the picture on the Domenica website.  Chef Alon came out to say hello to a few tables, but not ours. This is probably good, as I was ready to explain to him just how bad the pizza was.  Update: After contacting the restaurant, we were invited back to give the place another try. This time, everything was excellent. The Quattro Formaggi Pizza and the other dishes were beautifully prepared and nicely served. The sous chef greeted us and invited me into the kitchen to see the wood-burning pizza oven.

"Not quite ready?  We had a quick lunch here last week and it was OK. We ran into some of the same issues as noted by others about the slow and very nonchalant service. Everything took longer than it should and none of the servers seemed to care. A group of servers stood near the front door chatting and one was sitting in the back on her cell phone. The food and drinks were OK, better than we expected for Mall Mexican, but management had better really get to work here or it's not going to make it. You won't get referrals with 2.5 star rating on Yelp. Plus, it's not well advertised at the mall nor online.. the actual signage at the mall (inside and out) was poor. In fact, when walking through the mall, people could not tell what it was and the little door from the mall itself was not welcoming.  The location at the Galleria and open space could do well (look at how great Canyon Cafe does), but they need some help based on what we saw.   Pros: Location. Salsa and drinks were good.

"J. Alexander's has been a hit or miss restaurant for me, but over time I've learned the secret of what not to order.  J. Alexander's is on Dale Mabry below I-275 and just south of the intersection with Cypress. They're in a small shopping center next door to the Florida Orthopedic Institute.  The restaurant and bar evoke an elegant gentleman's club feel with dark wood, subdued and dramatic lighting, and plush leather booths. There are windows along two of the walls in the dining room, but they normally draw the shades to cut down on the exterior light. Instead there is a tightly-focused spotlight over each table, while the rest of the restaurant is dark.  Today I had my favorite item on the menu, their Maryland-style crab cakes. The cakes are mostly lump crabmeat with very little filler, and toasted golden brown. For my side I ordered orzo & wild rice, which is a cold salad that combines the orzo pasta and wild rice with Craisins, currants, roasted corn and roasted diced red pepper, and then mixed in their champagne vinaigrette. It's nice and light and balances out the spicy topping they drizzle over the crab cakes.  I like their salads, their sandwiches, and their seafood, but I'm not a big fan of their steaks. I have found the exterior crusts to be over-done and the meat to be tough and chewy.  At one time this was one of the better business lunch and romantic dinner spots in town.

"WTH does anyone think this is decent barbecue????????????????  Bark on BBQ is supposed to only LOOK like bark; it should NOT actually taste like bark off of an oak tree!  The food was awful -- it seems that they don't dedicate a full 8+ hours for the less choice cuts of ribs (i.e.: spare ribs) and that they actually may boil their spare ribs and then smoke for 4-6 hours...It's evident that they do use smoke since the red rings and the bark is evident -- however, the meat is TOUGH & DRY -- NOT BBQ!  They try to cover this up by hoping that you'll just glop a vat-load of their BBQ sauce (which is decent -- a little too sweet for me and their devil's sauce is weak) which I don't like to do and a true BBQ place should be able to present their meat standalone from their sauce.  I only went here on a recommendation from a co-worker...I'm now NEVER EVER NEVER speaking to this co-worker again!  This place is horrible -- go to FAMOUS DAVE'S BBQ (yes, they're a chain but DAMN fine BBQ Diane!); Dr. Hogly Wogly's Tyler Texas BBQ in Van Nuys, CA; or the Bear Pit BBQ in San Fernando Valley, CA if you're actually looking for GOOD BBQ in CA.

I ordered a house salad with their homemade ranch dressing, which actually is thick enough to be a dipping sauce, and a slice of veggie pizza. They didn't have veggie pizza ready but informed me they could have it ready in about 5 minutes. The veggies on the pizza that I recall, are tomatoes, broccoli, yellow squash, onion, and mushrooms. I'm sure there are more. I never had broccoli on a pizza before. It's not really my thing but I would love to try some of the other pizza offerings they have because it wasn't terrible. I will give this place another shot. With tip my meal cost $12 and some change.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Evan's may be a pizza place, but pizza is definitely not one of their strengths. While I do enjoy a lot of their food, such as the burgers, pasta platters, and hoagies, I really can't even stomach their pizza. The sauce is bland and Chuck E. Cheese tasting, and the cheese is thick and oily, almost like something you'd heat up in a microwave. With that being said, let me get back to focusing on the positives. Their pasta platters are very affordable and very well portioned, and their hoagies are fantastic if you are in need of a cheap, filling, quick, and delicious meal on the go. Personally I think their burgers are some of the best I've had at a place like this, mostly because you can taste that they use fresh ground beef and not prepackaged frozen patties, plus the cheese is just the right combination of melted and stringy.  What really makes Evan's earn their third star though is their beer selection, and glorified mini bar. They have an extensive collection of craft beer six packs, as well as ""Tall Boys"", plus a pretty decent selection of single bottles as well. When you first walk in there is a little nook featuring a limited selection of wines and liquors (must be consumed on premises) that comes as a welcome surprise due to the fact that most every other place in this area to get liquor (with few exceptions) are kind of run down and trashy. The price is just right, the pour on the heavy side, and they are always willing to make whatever drink they can using the liquors and mixers they have.  All in all Evan's is not a bad restaurant, not by any means, however it is also not an amazing one neither. Give it a shot for yourself and let me know what you think, it can't hurt!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We settled in at around 2 PM on a fairly busy Saturday - nice and sunny during Christmas break. The wife ordered a Yuengling Amber Lager and had to wait while they changed the cask. I ordered the Pirate German Pilsner - it tasted off at first and positively skunky by the time I had half drunk it. (Wife's comment - how can you drink that?) I suggested to the waitress the bartender should taste what they were serving, and she came back saying it's supposed to taste like that. No beer should taste like that. Don't order the Pilsner, and if your beer is the least bit off at this restaurant say something right away. The food was fresh and tasty, but portions are very small. The grouper tacos come in a flour shell that isn't even warmed, with a sliver of fish for $5 each (comes with chips - give me more taco instead!).  The count on the seared scallops is now down to four for $12 (someone else complained about five at that price). There's too much ancho seasoning and a strip of mustardy sauce. Scallops should stand on their own! One other note - the emphasis is on outdoor seating, but smoking is permitted in this very crowded, semi enclosed area. Halfway through our meal someone came in and lit up right next to us - we had to relocate hastily to avoid an asthma attack. Service was just OK - our first waitress turned us over to the other servers (and they don't wear distinctive outfits). When the wife's water glass was empty and we got the fly-by greeting ""How are you?"", I didn't catch on immediately. So, another 5 minutes spent waiting for the refill. Service = noticing the patrons' needs. Bottom line: they need to do better, or you can do much better, even in popular Dunedin.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Had a coworker gathering of seven to rest up this week and thought this place would have a great atmosphere to enjoy the end of the week. Boy was I wrong.   By the time we arrived we were shuttled to our table like cattles. Our waiter,Jon, kept coming and going to our table saying he is packed and busy and got more tables to deal with. It was a bit too rushed and unprofessional of him to say he doesn't have time to answer all of our questions but make a quick glance to the beer list and just pick one when he returns. Away he went.   The beer list was alright but the rushing made the food unappealing. My coworkers didn't get all of their meals and the staff kept saying oh we can only order food four at a time!!!! What kind of timing of service is this??? I looked around and didn't see that busy of a night.   I had the Mac n cheese lobster angus burger and the diabolique beer. But the others were not as easily pleased with the food.   Drinks were just slammed on the table especially the water when we requested water and seems like the manager had to get the water for the waiter to deliver.   Even though the decor is amazing and the fire pit looks cool the food and service left us a negative feeling. Probably won't come back again with this type of service and demeanor. Probably a shortage of waiters that night but still should be at least greet people with a happy face.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

After a day of traveling and getting in at the Indianapolis airport, my friend and I heading to Mass Ave to get a well deserved meal. They were packed, but they were able to seat us at the bar immediately. The bartenders were both fast and friendly, and it didn't take long to have a burger, fries, and Triton IPA in front of me. First of all, they have EXCELLENT ketchup with subtlety and flavor, and I normally find ketchup to be an obnoxiously overrated dipping sauce. I got the Farmstead burger, which was awesome (big fan of Brussel sprouts), but the patty (medium rare of course) was so perfectly tender that I can guarantee all of their burgers would be great as well.

The first thing we asked for was a wine list, and our server couldn't find and produce it until our meals were delivered.   Service was slow, drink orders took forever to refill. Oysters were great, my lobster Mac and cheese was decent, the blackened catfish was bland and not at all blackened, and the fried chicken dish was misleading (it was breaded and baked as opposed to fried). Everything needed more seasoning.  They also offer a military discount, but insist on taking the ID and walking around with it until they find a manager to verify, as opposed to flagging down a manager to come to the table, which made me extremely uncomfortable, like they were photocopying it in the back or something.

The French Bread with beer/honey/orange butter.  I am sure I am getting these names wrong, but seriously...  How can you not order something that sounds like that?  It was amazing!!

"Seriously, what the heck was wrong with this place?  Came here for a late MONDAY dinner, around 7:30pm and there was still a 20 minute wait for a table. When we were seated, we got the after-hours menu....it was 8pm. Is that really after hours? And the after hours menu only had appetizers and the two entrees were a burrito and a taco salad. Decided to make the best of it, so we ordered their wings with chimichurri sauce which turned out to be the best thing we ordered. Then between 4 people, we ordered 2 burritos, a quesadilla and a taco salad. The food tasted fine but it was pretty much on par with Taco Bell. Service sucked. Here's the list of things that went wrong:  1) Our chips were super stale 2) Salsa bar had limited options, nothing special about their salsas, honestly just tasted like ketchup 3) We had to ask for utensils 3 times because they were not on the table as we sat down 4) Waitress did not clear our appetizer plates when we received our entrees  5) Thus, we barely had room on our table 6) Also had to repeatedly ask for chips refill...weird thing about the chips refill, they got stale the longer they sat on the table, what?! 7) Waitress did not remember our drink orders or our food orders... it was NOT that crowded, she should've remembered. 8) We had to get up and get our own napkins because we couldn't depend on the waitress to get them for us 9) Waitress delivered bill without clearing the table....how are we supposed to have room to pay?  I noticed there was a photo booth for customers to take pictures with the Cantina Senioritas.

They have a decent selection of wine and some bottle beers but if you're going alcohol free, the tea's are pretty good.  The layout of the store has recently changed. The older format was darker, smaller and more intimate. The new layout allows many more seats and is very bright and more family family.

"What's not to love about an Aimee Olexy and Stephen Starr collaboration? This new spot has all the ingredients for a match made in heaven.   Although it only opened in the Winter of 2018, I felt like eons had passed before my first visit in the middle of May 2018. Trust me, it had been number one on my list of places to try for a while.   So, my first visit was during lunch hours. I'm already jonsing to go back for dinner and explore that cocktail menu. In the meantime, it was love at first bite with everything I tried.   Our group started with the crudités and goddess dip for the table. I'm not really sure what was in the goddess dip, but it was green, creamy and had a pesto-like resemblance. Eaten in the privacy of my own home, there would have been plate licking going on. The veggies were a mix of radishes, carrots, peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, asparagus and beans. Veggie plates are usually boring; however, these were honestly the most fresh, crisp veggies I've had in my lifetime.   Debating between the ricotta ravioli with lump crab, carrot sauce, basil and fennel pollen and the Tuscan black kale risotto with meyer lemon, pecorino and crispy brussels, the server suggested the risotto as being the stronger of the dishes. Both dishes were ultimately ordered, but I would conquer that the risotto had that something special to it.   Don't skimp on the extras; our table split the chips and fondue, cucumber and feta salad and the cheese ball with lavender, pistachio, fig-honey and crips. At least for lunch, there isn't a true appetizers menu, but these sides can fill that void.  Although stuffed, we decided we had to try one dessert and went with the cast iron cake with rhubarb batter and ginger-honey ice cream. It came out piping hot in the cast iron but had refreshing qualities because of the ginger ice cream and fresh ingredients.  With any restaurant that you put on a pedestal before visiting, there's a chance for disappointment. The Love blew my expectations out of the water, and have left me already eager for a return visit.

"We used to get good pizza a year or more ago.  However in the past year not so.  We thought we'd give them another try a few days ago and ordered delivery for a supreme pizza, a 2Liter bottle soda and cheesesteak sandwich.  The pizza was unacceptable to us, they charged for but did not bring the 2L. soda $2.95 extra.  The cheesesteak was horrible to me because it tasted like old burnt oil or grill needed cleaned.  We called and talked with a girl and cook.  I explained to the cook of how things were and tasted old and grill possibly needing cleaned.  He did not agree and said everything is made fresh daily.  They were to come and pick up the pizza and sandwich and not charge our card as we did not want order replaced.  They did not come.  I called and girl answered and said guy would be here sometime to pick up and when I asked to speak with cook she said ""He went shopping.""   They never came to pick up and we called several times a day to take the charges off our credit card and they just keep hanging up on us.  so here we are today with inferior food and not even everything we were charged for.  Very poor customer service, charges for undelivered item and food was so poor quality to us that I even asked them were they going out of business.  Called again a few minutes ago and girl hung up on me again!  The charges for pizza and pop $22.26, $747 for sandwich delivery fee $2.00-$3.00 plus tip, it won't make us or break us but we won't order from here again.  I actually still have the pizza and sandwich here still.  Does anyone think I should take it all back to them since they won't talk to us or take back the charges?",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Finally some poor schmuck happened by and said ""you need more coffee?"" and I said, ""I needed more coffee 20 minutes ago.  Now I just need my bill."" I look up to see the waitress coming back from somewhere with a bag.  Apparently she needed to go shopping.  The helpful dude did bring me a coffee to go.  I left no tip.  Meanwhile, I should add, the manager=type person was serving folks at the bar area and seemed to be having a nice visit with them.  He should pay more attention to the rest of the room.

"I really, really, really want to like this place.  I used to work out here when it was Sports + Field.  I've been in three times and my thoughts on the place are this...  Beautiful facility.  Great Beer.  Very Very Expensive Food.  I will give you the good first.  I really enjoy the beer.  My favorite is the Brown and both IPAs are really good.  But criminy why is the food so damn expensive?  I ordered buffalo cauliflower...it was mediocre and small. I also ordered the pimento cheese dip which was incredible, well worth it.  My party of 7 each ordered a burger.  Why the hell are burgers $15?  What was I thinking?  Not worth it.  I ordered the 7 Oaks cooked medium.  It arrived well to very well done.  The beef was a good size burger definitely 1/2 pound but was unseasoned and lacked flavor.  The menu said...""1/2 lb grilled patty, beer and bacon jalapeño onion jam, pepper jack cheese, crispy onion strings, house-made guava BBQ sauce, and pulled mojo pork, on a toasted brioche bun.""  Should be packed full of flavor.  Was totally bland and dry as the Mojave desert.  I was starving so didn't send it back.  At $15 and that description... it should've knocked my socks off.  It didn't.  I asked my other guests and they described theirs as burnt.  Well done.  Two members of our party enjoy their burgers cooked like that and were fine with the result.  All in all the two apps, 7 burgers and ~6 beers totaled $169, with tip I was at $200.  Damn.  I will be back...as I said I really want to like this place.  I may even eat first and then go up there for a few beers.  I have no issue paying for a good experience.  The place is awesome, the staff is friendly, service was great.  It was NOT worth $200.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I found this little spot tucked away on Rt. 30 in Berwyn. I ordered the Laotian sausage,  Pad Thai and Thai wings. The sausage was delicious and had a little heat to them. The pad thai was also quite good. This being said, I was in the mood for a curry. So I ignored, at my own peril, the bad  reviews of the curry.  Here's how it went down....  I ordered the red curry (my favorite). It smelled like a good curry but it was watery. The portion was also smaller than some of the other curries that I had. However, the curry consisted of undercooked vegetables.  Mostly carrots and bamboo shoots. Rock hard and tasteless!

"The absolute worst McDonald's I've ever been in, without a doubt.  The establishment is disgusting and usually, generally unsafe (last winter, there was a thick sheet of ice on their parking lot that they refused to do anything about). The ice cream machine is usually down, and when I'd order a meal (usually a fish-o-filet), the fish would taste dry, the bun wouldn't be steamed, and the tarter sauce would sometimes be in the box, rather than on the sandwich. The fries would also taste hard and like they've been sitting.  Long story short, I've actually dubbed this McDonalds the ""Bad McDonalds"" when referring to ones I'd visit, and it's for good reasoning. They remodeled it earlier this year, and it STILL looks a mess. Only go there if you absolutely have to, but try not to.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Let me prelude this with the fact that this was not our first experience at LoRusso's, was at least the bakers dozen visit or so.  Please be ware of this restaurant if you are not a drinker, as in alcoholic beverages.  Of the thirteen plus times we have been at LoRusso's they have quickly gone down hill with the service, each time, getting progressively worse.  However, our return visits were because the food is phenomenal.  However, I will focus strictly on our visit last night for this review.  We make a reservation, get there early and are seated right away (it was 8 pm after all).  Good so far.  We are seated and told our server will be Jennifer.  Great, because the male wait staff suck.  So we were excited.  So then Vince pops over and takes our drink order, returns with the drinks and proceeds with the specials.  We decide that the risotto sounds good and tell him we will have that as an appetizer.  Vince leaves.  I take a drink of my tea, and it is stale, like sitting there all day stale.  So I look for Vince, who is at another table delivering food, I make eye contact.  He then goes to a new table where he tells them about the specials.  Then he disappears.  Meanwhile, our risotto shows up.  Keep in mind we have yet to order our entrees. We finish the mediocre risotto and still no fresh tea, no Vince.  Then our plates, the appetizer plates are cleared, no Vince.  I see him present a bottle of wine to both tables, and assure myself he will come apologize for the wait, etc.  Nope, my hubby and I waited 45 minutes to have an opportunity to place our entrée order.  So Vince finally gets to the table, and says ""So are you ready?""  that's it, no apology, no respect, nothing.  So since we were no longer as hungry, we got the check and left.  After visiting this restaurant for its wonderful food several times, this will be the last.  We are tired of being treated as second class, bottom of the barrel scum, because we are not wine drinkers.  So if you want some place that has wonderful food, go here.  Just be prepared for male waiters full of attitude, and a three hour dining experience, even later in the evening.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

We split the bruschetta, which was great, and I got a warm crab and radicchio salad which was unbelievable, the balsamic dressing was the perfect accompaniment to the heartiness of the salad. Then came the star of the night, the pasta. I got the pesto gnocchi which is a must if you're going to a place called pesto. They did not disappoint!

Maybe it is the wood fired brick oven, or the fresh made tomato sauce, or the flakey crust or the real deal Italian ingredients,  but once you try one of Dolce Vita's pizzas you will never eat an American Dominos style pizza again.We ordered the Pepperoni and Sola Carne.Both were great.  The house salad had a garlic dressing that was incredible, too. The only reason that I gave this restaurant a 4 star instead of a 5 star is that the interior is in desperate need of some kind of style to give it some type of ambiance.

"I really wanted to like this place. I even tried two different pizzas on two different occasions: but each time I'm just left with less money and dissatisfied. The pizzas aren't horrible here- they just aren't great. They are super bland- even the dough for some reason tastes bland with a slight bleach taste. I tried the Margherita pizza first: and while I know the sauce on a Margherita pizza is usually simple, I've had quite a bit of these types of pizzas and none have ever tasted so boring and bland. It was like they crushed the Marzano tomatoes but then didn't add any other spices to enhance the flavor. The next pizza I tried was a potato pizza with rosemary, bacon and Alfredo sauce. Honestly I couldn't even taste the Alfredo sauce. It was just ok. Nothing I would try again and wasn't good enough for me to even finish my small pizza. The price was almost $15 for a small pizza: at that price I want to be wowed or at least enjoy it enough to want to finish the entire meal.

"Our favorite meal of the trip, our favorite dinner that is.  Love the ambiance and decor in this restaurant, sort of masculine with a great palette of materials and textures.  Wait staff are friendly, I like the tag team approach.  So many delicious items to choose from on the menu.  We started with the burrata and tomato salad and the upside down cornbread.  Cornbread was light and moist and perfectly dense.  The finely diced bacon and pineapple on the bottom flipped and topped with green onion was delicious and concentrated Smokey sweet flavor.  The burrata and tomato was my favorite.  Creamy burrata with olive oil and balsamic with fresh diced cucumbers, beats, cherry tomatoes and pistachios.  It was light and refreshing with a touch of sweet and creamy.  For our mains I got the special pork larb and hubby got the grilled drum with creole meunière, roast potatoes and green beans.  We devoured both our mains.  Mine was fresh, spicy, herby, with notes of toasted rice and Thai chili's.  The pork could have been a little more flavorful, felt it was a little light on seasoning on the pork itself, but it was still excellent with the freshly steamed jasmine rice.  Hubbys fish was incredible.  Grilled perfectly, mild and moist with crispy skin.  The sauce made the dish, the creole slices and creamy texture with the fish was amazing.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked, creamy inside and slightly blistered green beans.  If we come back to NOLA, we will definitely eat here again!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I was a little skeptical of another gourmet burger joint opening but reLISH impressed me. I chose the burger ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" and my boyfriend chose ""The  Nordique"". We were immediately taken to flavor country!!  The chef who dreamed of such complex and quality ingredients for these burgers deserves to own a successful franchise.  The staff at this location were very friendly, and we were even entertained by their quirky approach to hollering hello when you walk in. We got a good laugh out of the 5 people behind the counter each yelling our name when the food was ready.   The onion rings were crispy and the best deep fried type you could want. I nibbled on my boyfriend's fries but they didn't particularly amaze me - but I know he appreciated that they had the potato skin on the ends.   We enjoyed sitting on the couch, and found parking out front with out a problem.   I tend to prefer thick, juicy patties but because of the complexity of ingredients with this burger- the thinner and dryer patty didn't bother me at all.

"I like pizza.  I really do.  It's been a part of my diet since I can remember.  But I have never had St. Louis style pizza before.  So, for my last night in the STL, I decided to take myself to a place that served some ""local"" fare.    Apparently, St. Louis style pizza is a really, really, really thin crust pizza.  We're talking cracker thin.  And this means that the balance of sauce and cheese (I didn't get any toppings) has to be just right: not too much sauce or the pizza will get soggy, not too much cheese (or too little sauce) or the pizza is cheese on a cracker, and not too little cheese or it's like munching on tomato paste.    CWP gave me an okay introduction to the St. Louis style pizza, as okay as a chain can get.  My crust was not soggy (good).  But it went a little overboard with the cheese because, at times, I barely tasted sauce--a very dry pizza (bad).  In some bites, though, there were tomato chunks, and that balanced the cheese out quite nicely (good).  The atmosphere is jovial and friendly (good), though I would definitely not want to eat my pizza there since it's pretty small and more of a take out atmosphere (bad if you want your pizza piping hot).  It's cheap, though (good), and they have a 2-for-1 deal on their largest size (also good).  Lastly, they make individual sized pizzas, which are great for one person or if you want to share a snack (good).    Bottom line:  I think there's got to be better out there.  However, if you're staying in the Central West End, it's definitely the most convenient place to find some St. Louis style pizza.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

On a typical visit here, we order tacos and mulas and we typically stick with al pastor and suadero. These are our two favorites here and on this visit, they did not disappoint!  I had tacos de suadero (which is a beef) and an al pastor (spicy pork) mula made with a corn tortilla. The suadero was perfectly tender and the al pastor was not overly crispy nor undercooked, it was just right! I recommend having the mula with a corn tortilla because it's such a better combination.  While the meat was cooked just right, I have to be really picky because I know what I like and what I ordered. I asked for no cilantro yet my mula was full of it. My daughter had tacos de al pastor and only 2 of the 3 had the guacamole salsa.

"When I'm in a bind about where to go eat, I most always turn to Yelp for a good suggestion. Tonight was not one of those times. I happened to be at a neighboring business and decided to give this place a go. Not terrible,  but I have certainly had better.   The menu was expansive and the pricing was comparable to the competition. Right off the bat, I could tell that this was a true locals' spot - and those are the types of places I tend to gravitate toward. There were a few tables on the front porch area, and a number of tables and booths inside. One of the waitstaff was cleaning the tables when I was there. The place wasn't spotless but I felt that they did a good job at keeping it tidy.   I ordered the Super Nachos plate with carne asada. The cashier was a little flustered from the (very slow to pay) prior customer, but my transaction with her was smooth enough.   I was brought out a small basket of chips and salsa prior to the meal being served. The chips appeared store-bought but were warm, and the chip salsa was very flavorful.  It wasn't long before my hot plate of nachos arrived. The portion was tremendous and piled high with toppings. Right off the bat, though, I could tell that the meat wasn't fresh. It tasted as though it was cooked on a prior day and possibly reheated via microwave. It was dry, chewy, and lacked seasoning. As a whole, the dish lacked flavor. I poured the remainder of my chip salsa on the dish to give it a little extra taste.   The gentleman sitting next to me ordered a shrimp cocktail and it looked very good.

"I love the food.  It is pure perfection and extremely good. Great quality and presentation.  The service could be a five star if they just paid closer attention to detail.  1) at least 5 servers behind the counter on a day with empty tables....our $9.50 cocktails were served AFTER we received our food. strange. 2) server's shoes (originally white) could have been cleaned...I know that this is a strange observation, but just sticks out when the china and crystal are so perfect.   3) BOX UP OUR FOOD.  again, with such a wonderful setting and extravagant feeling, they hand the customer the box.  just wrong. Take the $13 piece of cake (carrot cake was the best I've had) and box it up for me.  Takes a few minutes.   4) Servers - act like you are at least faking happiness.  I sensed grumpiness as the server was clearing tables.  Pretend. Work is a four letter word but tips here have got to be wonderful. 5) If we are splitting a meal, bring an extra plate.  Just common sense.  Made us feel awful to ask but honestly, with the serving size, it is just wasteful to order too much.  (we saved space for everyone getting a dessert).  This was a Thursday at noon and again  - empty tables.  Spoil me for my $35 lunch.    thanks.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

They told me to just pick a cake already made or I could wait for the next day (the day after the party) to pick it up.

Our server seemed either new or just not interested in a tip, another server chose to vacuum the dining room while we tried to have our dinner. My Veal Oscar had canned crab meat ""bits"" on top and not leg meat. The asparagus appeared to be chopped canned and not fresh.

"I am a local who LOVES this place and comes here to get away from Belleair. Their scallop strawberry wrap is amazing!!!  Great staff most always! The laid back atmosphere is why I have come back here time after time and year after year!!  THE REASON FOR MY LOW STAR REVIEW IS FOR THESE REASONS BELOW....Staff and owner get 4/5's.....  This is one of my absolute favorite places! That being said, I have two major complaints that they will most likely do nothing about...  First and foremost - I find it POSITIVELY DISGUSTING beyond words that they allow dogs in the same area you eat!!! I like dogs but find it incredibly distasteful to have them shaking their hair, slobbering, smelling of wet dog after rain and blocking the walkways of this already cramped fish shack! I am very put off by eating food where dogs are allowed; plus I am allergic and think it should be outlawed to have dogs in the same area you eat! Extremely disgusting!  Second: Being a fish shack and market they should ABSOLUTELY know to remove the bloodline (dark grey or brownish vein) that runs through the fish - as it makes it incredibly bitter! I had two types of fish taco, the cod ( 2 for $7 great special), and the grouper (1 for $6), and BOTH had that bitter blood vein (dark grey meat) running through it!  All being said, I am a local and I love, love, love this place! That is one of the reasons I purposely have not reviewed it - I don't want the damn tourists to ruin it or over~run it!!! However, I hope they consider all dog lovers do NOT want stinky, hair flying, dogs in the place they eat and cut out the bitter blood vein out of fish! Any fisherman/woman knows that.  PS- Server Melanie is the sweetest! Owner is fun and knows beer, which they have a great selection of craft beers on tap!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Okay so let say we have been to this Outback many times. It is a rare occasion to get both good food and customer service. We will not be going back all the food was cold and under cooked stakes. They did not even come back right away to make sure stakes were cooked right! Manager was rude. I don't want anything free or discounted. How about just do it right! Oh that's right 50% capacity and still serve cold under cooked food. I will not be going back! I would rather spend my money at a mom and pop shop that was hit hard by Covid!

"I've got a new itch for some Chicken Scratch! Whose says you can't enjoy brunch for dinner? What a party for my taste buds. Ordered some for pickup tonight and let me tell you this Chicken and Waffle tray is the real deal! Order yours with the Signature Honey Hot sauce if you really want to experience something savory, spicy, and sweet!   The chicken wings are huge with a perfect breaded crisp and crunch! Dip them in the sauce provided and it takes these wings to the next level. My lips tingled and my nose opened a little bit more with this mild heat but that's part of what makes these Hot Wings!   (Spicy level = one  pepper worth) Totally tolerable for a spice wimp like myself. I can't tolerate much so trust me it's the perfect amount.  The waffles are so good. Can totally enjoy those all by themselves. They come with a dusting of powdered sugar, and they are just the right amount of toast and fluffy goodness. My food brought a comfort to my soul and a smile to my face. A warm meal for the chilly weather we are having.   I enjoyed three wings and two waffle wedges from this tray and I am more than satisfied with this. It's enough to share between two adults so plan to have some yummy leftovers and take your take-out dinner out again for breakfast in the AM! All of this for under $18 including tax.  Support this spot-on Black Owned Restaurant!   You won't be disappointed.   The only challenge was my pickup order time took longer than estimated but that's easily forgiven. I know they are working hard in the kitchen but this is where my four stars  was decided if being fully transparent.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The fresh pasta was great, though my wife's dinner was served room temp. The server was reluctant to return the pasta to be heated up, she had a bit of an attitude. She questioned whether or not the dish needed to be reheated, unacceptable in my eyes.  Others had a very small portion of fish and over cooked pork.  Word to the wise, go for the fresh pasta.

"The ambience of this restaurant is beautiful but it is definitely suffering from the amount of competition there is in Philadelphia.  On a Saturday night, it was pretty empty.   It used to be great but the food quality is not up to par and it is very expensive for what you get.  When we ordered salads, no fresh ground pepper was offered, the crab in the salad tasted old.  The bread was warm on the outside but cold on the inside.  The wine list is very limited and the wine per glass, despite being pricey, tasted off, as if it had not been stored well.  I tried two types of wine and both were not underwhelming for $16 per glass and very small pours.  The entrees for $30 dollars or more, only include one piece of meat and no sides such as vegetables, roast potatoes etc.  When your son says that the Veal Parmigiano tastes better at home than at the restaurant and that there is no point to go out, you know there is a problem.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I have been to this Red Robin many times since it has opened. I have been seated in the bar area, the dining area, I have been with a family and just with friends, during lunch and dinner, and have gotten curbside to go - twice. I have had my fair share of burger experiences. My biggest problem is - this location is small. The waiting area is cramped and if you go on a weekend at dinner you're going to be waiting awhile. The staff is always nice, out of all the times I've been here I've never had a problem with a waiter/waitress only one time the waiter was just ehh - more like lack of personality. But usually they're all super nice, and helpful! Especially when it comes to using the machine at the table to pay. I usually come once a year with my friend during our birthday months and trying to figure out how to pay separately with two reward cards is confusing, it's either that or splitting with my mom and her birthday rewards (the curse of a popular birthday month). I've never been disappointed with the quality of the food but once - fried pickles - SUPER SALTYand just not good but the manager offered to come them. We didn't seek him out or complain - but he asked how they were since they we're a new menu item (at the time). Dining in is usually a great time- bottomless fries and drinks a plenty. Went to curbside twice. You must call once you get there- there is a number on the sign. This last time we had a super nice girl who brought us complimentary fries - how sweet ! She also double checked with us that our order was Correct since we had called for some add one. All in all definitely one of the better Red Robin's !",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I don't like the fact that nearly all the items has ""nacho cheese sauce"" on them. The ground beef was tasteless. They ""hot sauce"" they provided was not spicy at all. Maybe I'm picky being from SoCal. This was just not good ""Mexican"" food. I wish them success, but we won't be back. I would even prefer Taco Bell and I don't care for them.

There were only a few diners there when I arrived, but it was early in the evening. The interior of the restaurant was spacious and clean.  We were immediately greeted and seated. My host for the evening was Tina, and she was organized, friendly, and attentive especially considering I was with a large party. I ordered a mango bubble tea. It was frozen and vastly different from the bubble(milk) tea I've had previously. I now prefer the frozen fruit flavored smoothie version. I also ordered the chicken and crab rolls for an appetizer which were pretty good. The main course was pho with chicken. I think the broth could've been a little more flavorful.

The staff was friendly but obviously ill prepared to serve. The line between cook and manager looked to be a thin one as our cashier could hardly take my order without being talked over.

"This place is literally a diamond in the rough. The surrounding buildings and homes are not the greatest. The parking lot is too small. The outside patio seems pretty relaxing. The food was very good but not as good as the prices would suggest. Same with the service. Our waiter was nice, but average and on the slow side.  NOT good for kids.... definitely not kids under 7. But even with an older kid but not a teenager....no kids menu. I couldn't believe it. The waiter said they can do 1/2 portions. But kids chicken parm $34 is insane. I think it was really full sized but no child needs that size meal.  The waiter just put in on the bill and assumed I wouldn't notice I guess.   Crab cakes are huge but they came with a white sauce drizzled over them which I didn't love the look of it!  Also I found 3 or 4 shells in each crab cake which is an automatic turn off for me but especially for $59. That's unacceptable. Lobster was great, cooked perfectly. My friend thought the filet mignon was amazing, very tender but again very pricey. Creme brûlée was very good but $9.   It's really like Philadelphia prices in Salem Co.

We got to the restaurant and the host at the door told us that it was no problem if we were not wearing masks if we wanted to sit outside because my wife had left her mask in the car. We were about to be seated before the manager walked up demanding we wear masks in order to be seated. We tried reasoning with him regarding the recent update lifting the mask mandate in FL but he would not have it. The host and waitress finally butted in and told him that we were just staying outside and we would not be entering the building. We are not anti maskers but the miscommunication from the manager threw us off. Following this interaction, we were seated and my father in law went to use the restroom where he found no soap to wash his hands.

"Sake House is my favorite place to get sushi because it is so darn inexpensive. The lunch special (2 rolls, miso soup, and ginger salad) is about $8, which is so cheap! The dinner deal is only $4 more, starting after 3:30pm. There is a bit of a hit in quality, like with service time, but overall, it is very fun to come here. The atmosphere is very enjoyable in my opinion (just a little loud sometimes with CDB right next door). My favorite roll is the sweet potato roll. I love the cream cheese inside paired with the fried sweet potato. It all will melt in your mouth! I am not a huge fan of the veggie roll, but you can asked for it tempura style, and it tastes amazing. They easily have taken special requests when I ask for things like tempura style or add cream cheese on rolls. Back when I ate fish, my favorite roll was the 2011 roll. The combination of the salmon and cream cheese tempura style is out of this world! You should definitely try this roll when you come here. I enjoy the convenience of this restaurant (right next to USF) as well as the hours and the prices of sushi here. As well, I've always found it easy to place an order online for food. They have a pick-up option, so all you have to do is fill out the order form online, wait about 20-30 minutes, and drop by to pay and pick up your food. It's super convenient for someone craving sushi with a busy schedule not wanting to wait in the restaurant for too long. I know I saw some other people say they prefer other sushi places, and I have tried a few others myself, but I have always liked the sushi I've had at Sake House best, and will continue to come here as a first choice.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
Two stars purely because the atmosphere was nice and the waitress was wonderful. However; when eating at a nice high end steak house at a nice resort you expect good food. Wife ordered the filet which was over cooked and had zero crust.   Biggest issue was I ordered 6oz of the A5 which when ordering that quality and expense of meat you expect it to be A5.

I glanced over the rest of their menu and they're charging $7-10 for a bowl of pho.. Anyone who's willing to pay this price for less than mediocre food is insane! Their bread was probably the best part of the sandwich and it wasn't even all that great.. The bbq pork was so bland and flavorless and for some reason extra pickled veges to them means less than the standard amount.. I probably had 5 pieces of carrot and daikon in there and it didn't even mildly taste like it was pickled.. It was just a soggy vege with no element of vinegar or salt.. I will definitely not be returning here no matter how bad I'm craving banh mi because they do a terrible job.. Someone please tell Lee's in Chandler, AZ that they should open a location in Tucson!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I was overwhelmed literally within the first few minutes of walking in. I was waiting with my mother in law for the second half of our party to walk from the car but the waiters quickly ushered us to a table, saying that they would show the rest of the group to our table when they got in. My butt hadn't touched the chair when carts came wheeling over. There were about 3 carts queued up behind the one serving us and there was this immense pressure from each person to choose items from their carts. Some of the cart owners didn't speak English so it was difficult to know what each dish was. There was a waiter helping us with the translation but he also seemed overwhelmed. Soon, the second half of our party walked over and looked bewildered and amused. ""You started without us?"" I couldn't help but give in to what was being suggested to me.  Fortunately, we learned to say ""no"" and watch out for carts with the items that we liked. It would be helpful to have cart menus showing what items were on each cart. We had the waiter to help us when we asked for more of a certain dish; he would track down that cart and ask them to come around again.  The actual food quality was a hit and miss with different items. My recommendation is to really look at all the cart items before making your selections (good luck overcoming the pressure!). The small plate costs will also add up so it can be a hefty bill at the end.   I'll be back because I think dim sum is a fun concept and there were items that I'd like to have again, but I will be more prepared for the second trip!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I adore Sugar Cat Studio. Alison is an incredible baker! I fell in love with her cupcakes a few years ago when I tried them for the first time at Corks N' Crowns. She also baked an assortment of bourbon infused cupcakes (one with candied bacon) for my big birthday bash in 2013. They were a hit and everyone loved them!   Alison is very creative. She can take your cupcake ideas and concepts and turn them into a delicious treat that you won't be able to stop eating; until of course they're gone and you have to order more!  I highly recommend SCS! With Alison, you really can't go wrong.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Typical chain restaurant that offers a simple, limited menu without ever being too creative. We ordered a shareable appetizer plate with fiery chicken wings, honey chipotle wings and some southwestern eggrolls. The honey wings were too sweet for an appetizer and the fiery red wings were not fiery at all. One of those restaurants that's an OK bet when there's nothing else around.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Good family pizza place, usually.  NEVER had a problem with Mama's until our most recent visit.  It is in the corner of a shopping center and had to find, with parking in the back.  Large pizza's in a cozy environment for years.  RECENT Not much has changed in this location, while familiar it is begining to seem dreary.  Went to celebrate a friend and family event.  Had the Pineapple and ham which didn't seem cooked totally, but no issues at the time.  Later we had three in our house with minor upset stomachs, one sick.  Then a week later found out another person was sick as well.  I think it was a one time thing which may be due to a lax attitude. But I think an upgrade in the facility would help staff to be more attentive to food quality.  I would still recommend, but if pizza is not cooked send it back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The last time or 3rd times the charm?  I'm going to break my 2 stars down for you. 5 stars to our server for putting up with poor management and working his ass off to provide service to us best he could while running plates, tending bar, cleaning tables and taking orders.   0 stars to the host. The four of us arrive and we are second in line behind a couple. The host confidently says 10 min wait. As we arrived I noted that a four top table had just left the bar area so I asked him if it was ok to sit there. He states that the bar tables are on the wait list not first come. So we wait, the couple is seated after 10min, we wait. 30 minutes goes by and he comes to seat us where? Yes the table that I pointed out to him 30 minutes ago.    2 stars for the meal/kitchen staff. Out of 4 meals they got 3 wrong and 1 was cold. Cold Lasagna is fine with I'm at home but when out l like it hot and so does the person who ate it. Ordered the Lamb Burger med well with 2 dressings on salad. Got Salmon Burger with dressing that didn't order. Second time around got Rare Lamb Burger. Third time got it right. Ordered Salmon salad with soup. Got wrong soup. Ordered Brisket Meal with horseradish on side, never got horseradish. I know the server got all this right because he read it back to us before he placed the order.   I chalk all this up to poor management, just as I felt the first time we came here. To bad because the atmosphere is good and the food (once they get it right) is fairly good also.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Support this woman-owned business! The food is delicious. I got the red curry and was pleasantly impressed with the food. I love spicy food and got a 4/5 on spice. I will be getting 5/5 next time because I love how delicious the spice is. I actually got their in-house made spice on the side so I could make it spicier and my girlfriend couldn't even eat a single noodle!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"The idea of this place is definitely cool. And don't get me wrong, I LOVE that they have three different types of vegan balls. Nothing is wrong with the ordering process and the staff -- all hugely helpful, BTW -- is more than capable of explaining how to best utilize the menu and fill out your sheet. I also like that even though the menu process is casual, the dining atmosphere feels elevated and intimate.  I didn't see drinks on the menu, so I thought this place must be BYOB. But turns out when we arrived, they only had beer and wine. I always feel pretty meh about this. Instead of drinking our natural vegan wine I had to let Future Husband choose a bottle to order and rack up the bill. I'm not a big fan of places like this. Either get your liquor license or be BYOB. Anyway, we were seated in a timely fashion (even earlier than our reservation time), and the food came out promptly, as did the wine. No complaints there.  The food is filling. And honestly, if you do get a few different balls with all different sauces, quite nauseating. If you don't like a meal with a variety of tastes, don't go the route of ordering multi balls and stick to one plate and one plate only. They do have recommendations for plates if you'd rather not mix and match. But nowhere on the mix and match section is there a warning: you may want to yak after putting this many flavors in your mouth. Also, the balls could have been warmer. My veggie one with creamy garlic sauce tasted and arrived looking like it had been sitting out in a display case all day.   For apps/sides, we couldn't say enough good things about the standard chopped salad. It was delicious and the perfect start to a meal when split by two. The Brussels side was good, but nothing to write home about when you consider how many places these days serve up a wonderful crispy Brussels side. We were also told to get the Mac and cheese queso which I was majorly disappointed in. It's penne pasta with some melted cheese on top and the tiniest bit of ""cream"" sauce underneath. TBH, it came out luke warm and pretty ... hard. Not that I mind an al dente piece of pasta because I certainly don't.   The dirty mashed potatoes were actually my favorite thing we ordered! Made with red potatoes, chunks of skin are mixed in and these were perfectly salty and seasoned. Whoever came up with the recipe for this side, HMU, I'm coming over for Thanksgiving dinner.  Unfortunately we were too stuffed for dessert, but left feeling happy with the customer service, prosperous with two to-go boxes of the stiff and cheese and dirty mashed potatoes (half of which I dropped on the ground when I was spooning them into the box but Future Husband doesn't know that yet and won't until he reads this. Wanted to let him enjoy them first. YOLO Joey, are you alive right now? Yes. And I know you finished them off at like 12am), and nauseous with a full and unopened vegan bottle of wine in our hands. They got us there.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
If you are looking for a good burger and tater tot's look no further. Burger study is a more casual restaurant by Saint Elmo steak House. It provides a good medium if you're wanting to be a little more conservative with the cash yet still get the Saint Elmo vibe. They serve their famous shrimp cocktail that is also served at the main restaurant. I got a classic cheeseburger with tater tot's as my side and the beer on draft. It is a nice addition to the downtown area.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
Ordered a pizza w out tomatoes and walked in to them picking the ingredients off a pizza and then throwing them back in the ingredients to be used later! So gross! And when I asked to have a new one made they got snotty! And when I asked what their manager would think they didn't even answer me. I will not be coming to this location ever again.

"I like this place enough. The pros being that the food is good and cheap. The main con being the amount of people that visit the joint. The parking lot is ALWAYS packed and the drive thru is ALWAYS slammed with a huge line of cars. I have never seen anywhere so crowded every hour of operation. The drive through is so long that it is probably faster to go inside. The employees work hard and dish out a huge amount of orders, but it can only go so fast. Not a good place for lunch because it will be hard to get back to work in time. The food is good, but it is not good enough to warrant the effort in my opinion. Another problem with the amount of people is that it becomes difficult for the employees to keep everything really clean. It isn't overly dirty, but it definitely isn't clean either. It isn't my favorite, but obviously a lot of people disagree with me! Go try it out!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The kobe burger is great.  It has grilled onions,  red pepper dressing, roasted tomatoes (nice touch), brie, spring salad mix served on a knot bun (think brioche).  Good beer selection.

"I want so badly to like Smashburger, but it always leaves me disappointed. I first tried Smashburger several years ago when their stores began moving into the Philadelphia area. I found it salty and bland the one time. I was in this area and saw one nearby and thought I'd give it another shot. I'd only tried it once years ago, and I thought maybe the issue was with that particular location.   The menu board is a bit confusing as it lists all the doubles as standard menu items with a little note that singles are available too. They're really pushing the up-charges and the increased calories. It also wasn't clear from the menu board, but I knew from my previous visit and from online that you could get any burger with chicken or a veggie patty instead of beef.   I didn't really care for the Smash fries previously, so I opted for the Smash tots. I got the burger with jalapeños and guacamole but subbed chicken and asked for no chipotle mayo which I saw ring up on the screen. For two burgers and two sides with water, the total was about $20.   The dining area has lots of seating choices from small tables and high tops to booths. The person who brought out our food was very friendly. However, after he stepped away and I picked up my burger, I noticed the chipotle mayo was still on there. I went back up to the counter, and they began making a new one.   Meanwhile, I ate my tots. While not as greasy as the fries, they were the saltiest tots I've ever eaten. They also were warm, but certainly not hot. I tried my husband's Smashfries and they were greasy and salty like I remembered.   My new burger arrived and it tasted pretty good overall. It was packed full of fresh jalapeños. I enjoyed the toppings and the bun. If you tasted the chicken separately though, it was not so great. It reminded me of that fake salty chicken they have at Subway.   With too much salt and high prices for mediocre food, I don't see myself hurrying back anytime soon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I was so excited to try this place once it opened and was lucky enough to get in not terribly after opening (I ate there a long time ago, just now getting to a review). The decor is really beautiful, light and airy. The staff is friendly and it's a nice little romantic spot. That's where the compliments end unfortunately. We sat on the patio area which was nice but seriously I don't understand the hype. The food was ok, not particularly good but edible. It was oddly loud and although they can't change the volume at which someone speaks, it was strange. Overall I think my expectations were just a tad too high. I thought I would be blown away and sadly I just wasn't impressed.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"In my opinion, there are a few reasons to go to Red Lobster.  1) You are a PETA terrorist and you are freeing the listless lobsters on death row hanging out in the tank by the door.  2) The cheddar biscuits.  3) You haven't been to one in over 10 years, have a gift card/coupon, and are curious as to whether or not Red Lobster is anything like you remember.   This weekend, I went for reasons #2-3. It certainly wasn't for the rest of the food, which was mediocre at best and outrageously overpriced. $15.50 for a tiny sliver of ""grilled"" (read: bland) salmon presented on a cedarwood plank (not sure what that was about, maybe some sort of pirate allusion), frozen broccoli semi-revived (though inedibly bland) by hot water and nothing else (this is the reason Americans hate vegetables), and a meh serving of rice pilaf. Ridiculous. I've had better food in a cafeteria. The $18 sirloin and shrimp combo was a bit better, because how can you go wrong with steak and a skewer of garlic shrimp? Actually, the garlic shrimp was just okay, and nowhere near as good as garlic shrimp can be (hello Jose Garces). The mashed potatoes were fine, but they're mashed potatoes. I could make better ones myself. The Caesar salad was overly salty, but serviceable. And these were some of the cheaper things on the menu. Plenty of items run up to $30, with lobster costing more than that. If you're gonna spend that much money, take yourself to a nice restaurant with halfway decent food.  One star for the biscuits, and one star for friendly (but slow) service and vaguely edible food (I'm being generous here).   Scratch reason 3. I guess that means there are only two reasons to go to Red Lobster.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
