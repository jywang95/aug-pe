"""Bravissimo!  Ancora una volta*, a simply wonderful experience and another terrific meal!!   ""Last night, again*, my wife and I enjoyed one of the best dining experiences we've had since moving to Tampa.  We at last met and were warmly welcomed by Owner Franco.  Everything else about the evening was equally memorable-from the first sip of wine to the last bite of homemade chocolate brownie.  The ambiance of this intimate and tastefully-decorated restaurant/room-seated, this time, in the corner opposite the television-made the evening complete. We shall return again very soon.""

This place is awesome. I have been to both this one and the one in Lansing MI. The one in Lansing has better fries but they both are very good. The Cheese sauce is really good it makes the fries even better. I love the Mac and Cheese it is AMAZING. This is the best Mac and Cheese I have ever had amazing. I love that you can create your own Mac and Cheese and the variety of toppings makes it interesting. If you are near this place and want to try something good this is the place to go. ~Critic Kid,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I've been visiting my parents over the Christmas holidays and they took me to Mangos and Marley.  Wow! This place is great; a hidden gem in Downtown Dunedin! The place has a coastal beach feel and a very relaxed restaurant. The staff and owners are great.  THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS!  The first time I was there I had the Bahama Bowl which was an excellent choice to dip my feet in to this place.  The chicken was seasoned nice and the cilantro/lime rice was very good.  The mango drizzle is what brought the whole bowl together!  The second time I was there, I tried the island chicken sandwich.  This was also very good.  The mango mayo was delicious and the Bianco roll was the best tasting bun I've had with a chicken sandwich; soft and lightly toasted.  The restaurant is somewhat small, so it may be hard to find a place to sit if it's busy, but we'll worth the wait.  They have a bar area as well as table seating; even a few outside.They also do takeout and have a social media presence.  I would have gone several more times while I was there; however, they were closed a few days due to Covid I believe.  This will definitely be my first restaurant I hit the next time I'm in town!  Well done!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Excellent Guatemalan - we ordered nearly everything on the menu and with the exception of the quesadilla (which is deep fried) it was all incredible.  The Papusas are a must-have and make sure you get extra sauce.  BYOB so make sure you've brought plenty (the liquor store across the street might not carry the vintage you want, unless it's grapefruit flavored)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Fat Guys has abundant vegetarian and value options. Try a half a salad made how you like it with house dressing on the side.  Substitutions are not a problem.  I've had the sandwiches and they are good.  But salads are awesome here.  It's a working class salad, nothing fancy but it does not have to be.  Coke products. Monster in cans but they charge accordingly.  Soup is well salted it's true, but not bad. Certainly not worth losing a star over.  Come on in, park in the back.  Drive past the front door and take the furthest left to get behind the buildings.  Enjoy.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"This is a pretty awesome place! I was really surprised to see a non-chain Italian restaurant in New Orleans!   The food is amazing, I got the Veal Roberto and it was delicious! My husband ordered the stuffed pork chop and it was larger than we thought! Portions are good size the prize. Good appetizers and lots of bread and butter. Very attentive servers!   Only thing that caught me off guard was upon entering the restaurant, you walk smack dab in people dining, there isn't a true waiting room but I can live with that, the food was just awesome!   Also this is pretty close to Tulane University so it's a cute area to stroll around.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I'm staying in the Embassey Suites here in Tampa for the night on business. My day started at 3:30 AM and I arrived for an early check in at 10:30. By noon I was hungry and decided to explore restaurant options in the hotel and stumbled on Trolley's and I'm glad that I did.    Being on a gluten free diet, I was pleasantly surprised when my waiter, Stephen, said that anything on the menu can be prepared without the bread. That's just how I like it.   I ordered the Prime Rib Hoagie (without the bread) with melted cheese, cabbage, and an au jus that was delicious. I substituted the waffle fries with vegetable chips at Stephen's suggestion. Overall, very tasty.  The service was quick and Stephan was polite and courteous.  You cannot l lose with this restaurant.

The super duper thing was the chargrilled oysters. Oh my,  they were better than first base on the first date. Wow, better than the other two places I had them. The raw oysters were like most other places, fresh and juicy. In both styles had a bit of grit or shell pieces. Not enough to offend but it was there.  The shrimp bisque was fabulous.

"We have been coming to Flan Factory ever since they opened, which has been at least a dozen times. Each visit has been consistent and always delicious! We'll look forward to many more visits! If you're new to Flan, the artisanal flavor variety really helps bridge that gap. I myself hadn't been a fan of it, but once I tried the Fruity Pebbles Flan, I was in heaven! Now I find myself wanting to try the rest of the flavors. But just be sure to not wait until towards closing as they will surely run out of flavors during the day due to popularity.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Every time I visit the Tampa/Clearwater area, I make an effort to stop by here. I love the rich Greek culture and the history behind this area. The Greeks setup shop here back in the day and made a living by diving for sponge!   The sponge is a live organism but they once they bring it up to land, they dry it and sanitize it to use as a bathing tool. I've actually went on a boat tour with a sponge diver and man, seeing what they did for a living was thrilling and inspiring. It's not easy work and the diving suit is super heavy with pretty much a hose feeding the suit with oxygen. The bottoms of their boots are lined with weights so they can walk down at the bottom of the sea and collect the sponges. It was a booming industry back in the early 1900's but not so much today since synthetic sponges are made in place of the live sponges.  There's quite a few restaurants and shops on Dodecanese Avenue; I've been to a couple of the restaurants and the food was excellent. The shops are pretty neat; I've bought a few souvenirs and soaps made from goat milk from them. Definitely stop by if you're in the area and do one of the tours, it's fun!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Surrey's rocks! I've loved everything I've tried from here, my only issue is that the wait can sometimes be a little too long for me! I love that they have a lot of vegetarian options for brunch, which is an issue for me at a lot of other brunch places in New Orleans. Specifically I love the huevos rancheros (it has mole on it), the costa rican breakfast, and the banana pancake (it is a huuuuuuge pancake, great for splitting!!!) There are so many other things on the menu though so I need to come back! I've also had their homemade bagels to soak up the yumminess of the other dishes and was very happy with the fluffiness of the bagel and the grits were absolutely delicious. On a recent trip I had an order of the shrimp & grits which were OUT OF THIS WORLD! I've been dreaming about them it ever since! The coffee is also really good, I got an iced coffee one time and it had a hint of nutmeg/ cinnamon which I really appreciated! The wait staff at Surreys is friendly and was quick to refill our hot coffees and waters. Be prepared to wait if you come on weekends though, since this place is very popular! For people who are in town during the week, I would definitely recommend visiting Surreys on a weekday or coming early! I had no wait around 10:45 on a weekend but by the time we left (a little before noon) the wait was crazy long! The atmosphere is a little funky and my parents refer to it as the hippy brunch place but I love the laid-back feel and will keep coming back!

"Loved it! I was recommended to eat here by lifetime New Orleans residents and they weren't wrong. Besides the unique location - located on Frenchmen St. away from the middle of the French Quarter -  the food quality and service were amazing!! Even though the restaurant is real small and they don't take reservations, they were able to accommodate for a group of 9 of us on a Tuesday night. We waited an hour for the table, which didn't bother us as we had a drink downstairs and listened to their live entertainment in the meantime.   My friend and I split everything. We started with lemon butter white wine mussels, which was the special of the night (about 25 mussels for about $16), then based on our server's recommendation we split the crab and corn cannelloni and then the grouper ocean style. All was delicious! If I had a moderate appetite that night, I would have had just the mussels and the cannelloni. All the pasta is made in house, which is awesome and the cannelloni had a spicy kinda creamy sauce over it and was stuffed with crab. The grouper was melt in your mouth and very good as well. Oh and try the house chianti - inexpensive (about $5/glass) and super tasty.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

They have Readbreast on the shelf and Sean doesn't drink, so if you feel compelled to buy him a drink, just buy one of their albums instead.  I've bought 2 of their albums and they're both great!  The house band (the nosey flynn) is absolutely great, fun, engaging and you'll be back!  If you plan on visiting for dinner on the weekend, make reservations a week in advance.

"The best family owned restaurant in the Wesley Chapel area, hand down! This small cafe/bakery is awesome and deserves a 5 as it's the best in the region. What I like most is that they care about the food delivered and each meal is consistantly good over time. They serve breakfast and lunch with many options on their menu and will adjust upon request. As for service, notice that the staff has been there for years (yes, years) with little to no turnover as they're friendly and enjoy working there which makes our experience better. Compared to their breakfast ""competition"" First Watch just try pancakes at each and you'll see that Cafe Fresco clearly dominates. Besides the quality of the food there, the bakery is outstanding as well.

The Hostess work to get us a nice table too. Everybody acted like they loved their job and took pride in doing it at a high level.  Food: wife had the steak and I had the alborone and they were both AMAZING. Mine was on a bed of incredible pasta and the flavors and texture was amazing. All the flavors worked and we really liked it. Our sides were the asparagus and twice baked potato's. Both were really really good and potato's had a truffle cream on it that was amazing.   Wine: my wife ordered a glass of Cabernet and they brought glasses for her to try a couple different ones so she had the perfect pairing!   Dessert: BAKED ALASKAN!!!! You have to try it, they 'burn' it in front of you and it is so light yet flavorful, you did yourself a disservice, no matter how full you are, if you don't get a baked Alaskan while your there.

"This is what sandwich dreams are made of in Reno. Seriously. This place is all the praise hands.  I stopped by on a Sunday around 1 and it was really quiet. I actually thought they might be closed because there was no activity around the building. But praise the sandwich gods, they don't close until 4 p.m.! This is a huge plus for me because sometimes the day gets away from me and I eat lunch super late. I love that I can still get sandwiches from Rubicon as late as 4 p.m., where as most lunch places close up shop by 2 p.m.   The selection of sandwiches had me excited immediately. Everything sounded delicious and mouth watering. They have a list of sandwich ideas to pick from or you can build your own from a list of bread, meat, cheese, and toppings. Sandwiches come in two sizes: half and whole. The half was definitely large enough for me to eat on my own; the whole would have provided leftovers. The menu also offers a few salads, soups, and two açaí bowls. I do wish they provided a couple ideas/recommendations for how to mix up the bread options with the sandwich suggestions... only because I tend to get a little overwhelmed and nervous to try a new concoction.   Before ordering I consulted fellow yelpers to check out their recommendations and tips and after countless recommendations I ordered the Dapper Dipper with blue cheese bread. Holy smokes Batman. This was unreal delicious. It was essentially a french dip sandwich on steroids. The blue cheese bread is exactly what it sounds like: blue cheese baked directly into the bread. The bread itself was nice and fluffy and tasted so fresh. The sandwich was packed with tender roast beed, swiss cheese, fried onions, creamy horseradish, and au jus on the side for dipping. So. So. So. Good. Each sandwich is also served with a delicious chocolate chip cookie.   The restaurant itself was clean and I'd describe the vibe as industrial modern hipster. They have a great little ""packing station"" for your leftovers. I wouldn't describe this place as a traditional ""deli"" so to speak but it is it's own thing if that makes sense. I highly recommend if you're looking for a different sandwich with fresh ingredients.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"A subway but for pizzas! I love the whole experience of watching your pizza being made right in front of you. I also enjoyed how quick it was for our food to be made and everything was so yummy! I asked which pie was the most popular and so I got the pesto my chicken which had pizza sauce, parmesan, fresh mozzarella, chicken, bacon, and pesto drizzle! I could definitely tell why this pie is the most popular, it was definitely delicious and packed with different flavors. The garlic knots were my favorite! The garlic flavor wasn't that strong, which I love and the bread was so soft and chewy on the inside and the outer layer was crispy. The calzone was also very tasty. I got the meat calzone packed with ham, salami, and pepperoni. Everything was so flavorful and the workers were all so friendly.

"Ive meant to post this for months.   First,what I like about this restaurant is they don't try and make the food you used to eat, hamburgers, Mac & Cheese ect. Instead food is pure, fresh, zesty, flavorful, clean and unprocessed.  Best food we have ever had!!!! Yes, better than the meat & dairy I used to eat. Cold cucumber soup was orgasmic - we fought over the bowl we shared. Spicy Grilled Tofu, Roasted Maitake Mushroom, Grilled Seitan, beets ect. The only thing you will regret is not being able to gorge, pig out and eat here everyday.  I didn't care for the desserts. Hubby enjoyed the Chocolate Uber Chunk - it was too sweet and rich for me. I had the cheesecake - I've had better. Wish I had tried the Toffee Pudding instead.  Cocktails are made proper. Strong with a little sweet.  A plus, you wont leave dinner feeling stuffed, sluggish, gross, sweaty and fat.  You will not be disappointed! This place does not mess around!  Only regret is, Vedge is not in Washington, DC or somewhere closer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This new restaurant is exceptionally good. My husband brought home takeout from here a few days ago. It was so good that we decided to eat in today.  We started with Crab Rangoon, Fried dumplings, and Spring Roll as an appetizer.  All were delicious. Perfectly cooked. Homemade flavor--not cheap bulk prepackaged food like many Chinese restaurants sell.    For dinner we had General Tso's chicken (heat level 4). It was not spicy at all for my husband who doesn't like spicy good.  The Veggie Lo Mein was great. Crisp Veggies  and very flavorful.   The restaurant is small and tucked back in the plaza so you may need to look for it. Only 4 booths and 3 tables so it is not large or fancy but worth a visit.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"so i mean, what can you really say. it ain't cheap, but it's a classy place on the main line, so they can get away with charging out the ass for stuff.  we went here for my birthday dinner. it was absolutely incredible. drinks are great, food is phenomenal, and service was good as well.  we started with sushi i believe (i drank a lot, lol). sushi was out of this world. EXTREMELY fresh, tender like butter, all different kinds of sushi that most places don't even serve. incredible stuff.  we had sort of like duck wrap-ups for our entree, to split. it was actually big enough to split, which you normally don't find at places like this. the duck was so tender, so flavorful, and everything else in the dish worked with it perfectly. sauce was fantastic as well. so good. my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  for dessert, this was so cool. i didn't know that they knew about my birthday, so i told them i wanted the b-day dessert (it's called something like that on the menu) - which is basically just some ice cream based dessert, common thing. my girlfriend really wanted the mini donuts that come with 3 different dipping sauces. the waitress said - get both! i'm thinking, of course she did, bigger check = bigger tip, but my gf said yes, and they gave us both.  they were both great, but the donuts, OMG. the dipping sauces were the best things. caramel based, chocolate based, and berry based. SO FREAKING GOOD. if you mix them they are even better ;)  best thing about it? she gave me the b-day dessert for free! at a fancy place like this, does that even happen? it doesn't even happen at TGIF's, lol.  awesome good, awesome service, awesome decor. you'll pay for it, but it's worth it - unlike a lot of places.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

The next visit, the waitress was prompt and gave great service too. Our food came out in about ten-fifteen minutes. Not a long wait at all! And it was very busy when we were there. That's talent!  This time I had the avocado spring rolls as my meal and my boyfriend had the jerk chicken pizza. His pizza was very juicy and I recognized that it tasted good but it's not the sort of flavour I clamor for. ;) He did beg me to share my avocado spring rolls.

The typical patron seemed more my speed, which is increasingly important to me these days (a mature crowd, not ""old"" but not mostly early 20s either).  I first went for an early dinner on a Monday afternoon while it wasn't crowded at all, but I also went back a few weeks later for Friday happy hour when it was very crowded and everything was still good.  The staff was great, the burger I had the first time was excellent, and the menu has lots of good options to try next time (I forgot what I ate the second time since I had a good bit of wine first LOL).  Even so, the food is surprisingly good and shouldn't be assumed to be typical ""bar food.""  That explains why it was so packed when we went back on a Friday night, despite the location not really being someplace you'd expect such a lively happy hour. This is definitely a new favorite spot!

"Ask to sit upstairs. Delightful ambiance.   Good solid 4 star place on Yelp.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it is AND to compensate for a few awful 1 star reviews. How can some tell the seafood was frozen? I am no expert but nothing we had tasted ""fishy"" which is, to me. my life long deciding point. The crab, shrimps, fried oysters were all premium to our palates. Gumbo, good to the last drop. Red beans and rice? Heavenly smokey taste and velvety smooth. This is not Popeye's. Fried oysters, superb! A hint of spicy breading, lots of them on more French fries that I can eat. We could not finish our portions.  Our waiter Val paid attention to our table, without being annoying, which is right on. He was pleasant, humorous. By the time we departed, after meeting management, it was all handshakes. Can't wait to go back.  Special note: While we may be Pennsylvania residents now, we lived in Houston over 2 decades.

"Five stars for the best oysters I have ever had. I came to New Orleans a little bit ago for a business trip and I had lunch at this location at the behest of my girlfriend's brother. He had been here a while ago and told us to go get the oysters. So we did. It was slammed, though. I had a 15 minute wait, but we were one of the lucky ones. The line quickly grew at the hostess' stand after we got seated.   So we ordered the Drago's Original Charbroiled Oysters (""The Single Best Bite of Food in Town"") as an appetizer for the table. Wow. These were insanely good. These things  were a little oily, a little cheesy, and charbroiled to a perfect doneness level that made me sad that we didn't order more. If you have time, stop in for these. Please.   My girlfriend and I also split the Fried Shrimp Remoulade Po-Boy (Served with French fries). Which was great. I had a lot of po-boys while I was NOLA, and they were all so good. The seafood is so fresh and it's all so thinly hand-battered and the bread is soft and chewy and hearty. I'll say it over and over again that the bread makes it a po-boy. If the bread's not right, it's just a hoagie, or a sub. Not a po-boy. Good job, Drago.   We also had a soup each. I had the Mama Ruth's Seafood Gumbo and she had the Shrimp & Corn Bisque. The gumbo was good, but the bisque was better. The gumbo had nice seasoning with just enough of a kick to know what city you were in, but the lack of actual seafood let the creamy, shrimpy bisque edge out the victory in this soup battle.   Overall, the oysters are what got this place five stars from me, and when I return to New Orleans, stopping by this place for a quick lunch will be on my list of top things to do.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding...need I say more???  But before that, we had:  Crispy Skin Duck Confit - I wasn't sure what to expect, but this was way better than what I was expecting!  Totally recommend this small plate. Blackened Shrimp & Grit Cake - grit cake was not bad but the shrimp stole the show.  Seasoned so well. Smoked Wagyu beef brisket with Garlic and Parmesan fries - tender meat and great fries.  The service was impeccable.  The place is quite small and worth the wait but I would recommend nipping the waiting issue in the bud by making a reservation.  And now back to the bread pudding.  Order it.

"I booked a room as a birthday gift to hubs - a night away for the two of us sans kids. The room was quit and comfortable with a lovely patio and gorgeous mountain views. It felt so secluded and like we were out in the country even though the resort is just on the outskirts of Tucson. But the BEST part is that we got 2-for-1 to the Sunday brunch as guests. This was our first time to the brunch and to say it was insane is the understatement of the century! One of the best meals I've ever had, truly!

"I nearly opened the door in the face of the older french waiter when I barged into the restaurant worried that my constantly late friend and I would miss our reservation. My purse was in front of me as I walked in and nearly knocked out the wait staff. The waiter, unfazed, pointed to my outstretched purse and asked ""Oh then is this for me?"" Hohoho deadpanning/charming older french man, thanks for helping me regain my bearings even though I nearly slammed a door against you. He led me to my table and continued to be charming/helpful throughout the evening.  This was my second time here after many years and the food/service has held up just as well as I had remembered. I had the escargot, cobia, and floating island while my friend had the foie gras, bone marrow, and flan. Everything was amazingly well done. A nice bottle of wine was split between us and by the end of the night we were both too full and happy to do anything but enjoy the cozy atmosphere. One of the young French chefs went around table to table to check in on everyone in the restaurant near the end of our meal and I may or may not be deeply in love with him (all signs point strongly towards the affirmative).

"The best meal I've eaten in New Jersey - and better than many of the big-name restaurants in Philadelphia (or elsewhere in South Jersey).  My wife and I went on a recent Saturday and loved everything about Park Place: the food, the service, the pacing of the meal and the care the chef clearly puts into every single plate.   The relatively small menu was filled with exciting options, each made better by the mouth-watering descriptions offered up by the server (Francesca?).  We loved everything about what we ordered, and now we can't wait to go back and get the other dishes we were considering (unless we're sidetracked by a new series of specials that get in the way!).

And a lady sitting at the bar accidentally flung her wedding ring off, and the whole staff stopped what they were doing, politely asked everyone to lift their feet as they walked around, and FOUND the lady's ring in a matter of about 2 minutes.

"My Daughter and I stopped by The Kettle & Grille for late lunch after reading some great reviews online.  Honestly, we were not disappointed ! The restaurant was nearly full but we were seated immediately. A plus was as soon as we were seated the server brought us each a glass of ice water as we were handed the menus.  Normally in most establishments, one has to ask for ice water, but since it was such a hot day, I'm glad she served it immediately.b  We shared an appetizer of poppers, chicken tenders, onion rings, mozzarella sticks and potato skins loaded with crisp bacon and cheese. Each item was better than the previous one, lol. We ended up taking home half of it as we had our entrees coming up.  LB had a bacon cheese burger served with French fries, cole slaw and pickle. Her burger was cooked to perfection, well done but not burnt. She ordered it with American cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion, with a side of mayonnaise .  It came out exactly as ordered. The portion was so large, she ended up taking half of her meal home.  I ordered the Reuben, with corned beef, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese on authentic rye bread. It also came with piping hot fries, cole slaw and a pickle. The sandwich was delightful, plenty of corned beef on a nice and chewy rye, no grocery store bread here. My only disappointment was the Russian dressing, of which I'm glad that it was served on the side. At first I thought that it was some kind of cheese whiz dipping sauce, it was that color orange and very smooth, not the kind I'm used to that has bits of pickle in it. It was, in one word.. Nasty.   Our Server was very attentive, she refilled our drinks just before they were emptied, and she stopped by our table a couple times to see how we were doing. Plus as it was obvious that we'd be needing take home boxes, she brought them by without asking.   Good food, large portions, clean and friendly environment..

"Awesome place! I've been to the original food trucks several times in New York and can easily say that the quality of the food here is equally delicious! The chicken and gyro were perfectly seasoned and warm. And you definitely can't go wrong with that white sauce. Definitely a spot to hit up if you can't make it all the way to NY. The combo platter is well worth the price ($7 for a small and $8 for a regular).

"Agh, I can't remember the last time I did a little dance while eating! Such delicious food! Came here twice within a week, and I was hella excited for the second visit! Came here with 5 of my girl frans to have a little Christmas celebratory din! Honestly, I had low expectations before coming here! Came through these Yelp reviews fearing there would be a lack of flavor, but I was quite impressed! So, a few days after I booked another reservation for my boyfriend and I. Took a little food adventure in Chicago the week before, but nothing there could compare to Meril's-service, quality, atmosphere. AGH, so good!  Okay, let me list all the dishes I've tried in those two trips with my thoughts:  Snacks: Louisiana Cajun Caviar-4/5 not a huge potato salad fan, but this worked so well! Great refreshing flavor, but we could've used a few more baguettes (or was it crostini? Who cares! I'd get it again!) Crispy Chicken Livers-5/5 yesssss, get it. Probably my favorite of the different crostini/baguette snack dishes. It is indeed crispy, but it doesn't have that intense flavor that makes it difficult to eat! Crispy Turkey Necks-3/5 the meat fell off easily. I LOVE turkey/chicken/duck necks. You can bet you'll catch me nibbling on these when my mama makes them, but these were a miss for me. I think these necks lose a lot of natural flavor through the cooking process :( Point Judith Calamari-5/5 does it make it bias that I love calamari? I've had many calamaris, and nothing compares to the $5 huge plate of calamari at Vinh Hoa in Houston, but this, this will do! It has such a nice little flavor twist. I do not like white beans, but I didn't even realize it was on the plate since it tasted so yummy! Gulf Fish Dip-4/5 this came with the perfect amount of crostini! It looked like a tuna salad when it comes out, but it has some fish-liciousness to it that I enjoyed! Nice on the texture and flavors here!  Salad: Roasted Brussels Sprouts & Sweet Potato-5/5 gimme all the Brussels sprouts dishes please. This was a lovely dish! Refreshing even with the roasted-ness. The grapes were such a turn on for this dish.   Wood Oven Roasted Louisiana Oysters (4 per order, so we got 2)-2/5 I'm sorry, but these were a no for me. Maybe I'm too used to Drago's? I didn't like the texture here. It had the odd grittiness to it, and was a little lacking in flavor.  Steamed Mussels-4/5 Yum! I read before that these lacked flavor, but I wanted to give this a try anyway since I didn't like the oysters. I'm embarrassed to say, I licked these mussels. I love lemony flavors, and this had a lot of that with a nice creaminess, too! I couldn't taste the coconut milk too much, but when I did I loved it!   Pastas: Saffron Pappardelle-5/5 GET THIS. OMG I love you Emeril for these fresh pasta dishes! Fresh pasta is another world from imported/dried pasta. This pasta had flavor and a nice portion! Bucatini of the day (something with clams!)-3.5/5 I thought this would've been the best pasta dish, but it wasn't for me. I thought it was okay, missing a lot of clam flavor.  Fettuccine Nero-5/5 got this one on the second trip, and wooh! This is where the happy food dance started. Just tried a squid Ink pasta at Mario Batali's Eataly in Chicago. I liked that one because it had a huge amount of seafood, but not a lot of flavor. This, this blows Mario's out of the water. It had flavor! And the smells of this pasta...so delightful! Only having crabmeat in it, I was totally satisfied because there was enough flavor to make up for the smaller amount of crab.   Robata Grill: Grilled Octopus, special robata grill dish of the day-4/5 was great, and the portion was nice. I liked it, but I probably wouldn't care for chasing this dish down again.  Smoked Pork Belly-2/5 this dish looked so odd. A few strips of thin pork belly is what you get, and a lot of sweet Hawaiian-y flavor. This tasted like something I've had before, but I can't pinpoint it! I didn't care for the portion, but the flavor wasn't anything phenomenal to me.   Veggies: Mexican Style Corn-3.5/5 ooh, so, so creamy corn. I fell in love with the Mexican style corn at Mais Arepas and Pizza Domenica, and hoped this would be another one to love. I guess it was a little too creamy for me! I wouldn't have mind a little more chili-ness to it.  Roasted Cauliflower-2/5 sadly, there was barely any flavor or nice textures here. Cutting into it, it seemed mushy. Not going to lie, it looked so good from the outside! I think if it wasn't so whole, and they cut it up so every bite had a crispy, roastedness to it, it'd be A+.  Brussels Sprouts-5/5 I'm totally bias for Brussels sprouts. Almost never had a dish with them that I didn't like. But this, this was the closest thing to the Brussels sprouts I loved and missed at the Sammich before they closed. That was the first time I ever had Brussels sprouts, and it was a good time. These Brussels sprouts are what I wished the cauliflower had-ROASTEDNESS IN EVERY BITE. And flavor!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"The Whiskey Barrel is located in a working class neighborhood in Gloucester City NJ.  It's a casual place, near the Delaware River, so it's not fancy or pretentious.  When we walked in, we were welcomed by the bartender, Alissa. The interior has been completely renovated and is clean and comfortable.  The food is well prepared, tasty, reasonably priced, and the service is excellent.  The chicken wings are HUGE and absolutely delicious. The main menu consists of appetizers, sandwiches, and full dinner platters.  We tried the sandwiches.  The Philly cheese steak was delicious and the meat was NOT stringy or chewy.  The grilled chicken Caesar wrap was awesome.  We were lucky to chat with one of the cooks, Jeff.  He told us that the establishment was always open to suggestions from patrons regarding additional food items to the menu.   John, one of the cooks, came out and asked us if we enjoyed our sandwiches. We were surprised that he was actually wearing a hairnet!!!  We were there for HAPPY HOUR  between 4:30-6:30.  Can't beat $1.50 draft beers!!! The bathrooms, though small, were very clean. This is an ideal place for families.  There are pool tables, darts, plenty of TV's, and a jukebox. This restaurant/sports bar is a hidden gem!!! Not sure what goes on at night when there are live bands!!!!

"We had just had a  big breakfast and were headed to a family food event when we stopped to see why so many people had given them 5 stars.  We were full.  I went inside, leaving my family in the car for a quick sandwich to go.  When I met the people, I understand why they have 5 stars.  It is a hole in the wall, family place.  Pictures of family line the walls along with neat fishing memorabilia.  The meat is cooked over a real fire.  there is no propane or electric heat added.  I have a new friend.  We talked for a long time about restaurant business and bbq styles....  He invited me to sit down so we could chew the fat some more...  and I wanted too, but my family was in the car....     I have about 50 family members within a reasonable drive from this place...  The secret is out now with my family...  Even though we were headed to a family bbq that same day, my wife went BACK in and got us each another sandwich, instead of the one to share I had initially purchased.  SO, one day, we will return, and until then. look for my cousins.  Especially the one on the paleo diet, she lives the closest.  The meat on the sandwich was awesome.  Had the chess pie too.  Five star on both.  Out of ribs and lemon chess the day I was there.  WILL RETURN....",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This place is do-o-o-ooooope.  When you first look at the menu, it appears to be a mish mash of traditional bar fare and Asian dishes. What you don't realize is that some of the items that appear ""traditional"" on the menu have a unique, Asian spin that you can just BARELY detect. It's super badass.  I'm speaking specifically about the buffalo wings. You can get perfectly cooked buffalo wings at a lot of places in the city but these buffalo wings are special. I won't give away any secrets, but the buffalo wings have the sweetest, most subtle Asian undertones that make you rethink buffalo wings altogether. Eat them. PRO TIP - Every Wednesday is Wing Wednesday and all wing baskets are $5.  We also tried the Dr. Tan burger and the lemongrass chicken tacos which were on fiya. Again, two traditional bar foods are given a very sweet & sour Asian twist. PRO TIP #2 - Every Tuesday is Taco Tuesday and all tacos are $2.  Besides the food, the ambiance here is everything you want from a local bar. Kind staff, cozy environment, CLEAN bathrooms. Just go!!!!!!!  Other fun things to note: 1. Happy hour is $1 off drafts & wells 2. Mon- Wed happy hour is 3 til close 3. Thurs & Fri happy hour is 3 til 7 4. Mondays are Mussel Mondays and mussels are $10 5, Fridays the chefs create specials out of whatever they decide (check out their Instagram for updates!)

"Just wonderful.   My husband and I had tickets for Tears for Fears,  so decided to eat at the casino.  I read reviews and looked at the menu for PY Steakhouse.  Looked good - the prices looked a little high but not a deal breaker.  We had reservations for 6:30,  we arrived early and were seated right away.  We were greeted quickly by the waiters assistant who was wonderful.  I say waiters assistant rather than buser because she was fantastic - the level of a server.  I believe her name was Lan.  The fresh bread basket came quickly and was great.  Our drinks came quickly as well and nicely done.  The staff asked if we were going to the concert and made a clear effort to ensure our food came quickly - but did not rush us out.  We ordered the seafood for two.  Fresh,  nice presentation and served with freshly made sauces beyond the basic cocktail sauce.  Our server was polished and extremely knowledgeable.   I cannot believe this restaurant is in a Tucson casino!  The level of service, quality and ambiance absolutely justifies the prices.     I have only gambled in Las Vegas - my husband has been to this casino in the past.  Gambling in Tucson just has not interested me - now it does as long as my husband and I hit the restaurant!

"This review is for the tapas.  I have never had the Italian food, because the minute I walk in the door, I crave tapas and the sangria.  We go as often as we can.  The wait staff is great-attentive and able to answer questions but not obtrusive.  They took care to have a professional appearance and demeanor.  My latest foray was a birthday lunch.  Sangria, Manchego cheese, croquettes, salad, etc.  I wish I could say more exacting things.  The food is tasty and served to the correct temp.  Plenty to eat.  The sausages my husband devoured were good and a bit less greasy than the usual ones at other tapas places.  Fresh and flavorful.  The consistency of the food quality is impressive.    The sangria rocks.  I am a total liquor lightweight, but this is my go-to drink.  The wine list is decent and the staff is knowledgeable.  My sangrias always taste like they used good wine in it.  There was food to take home, as is typical in St Louis.  The leftovers were tasty the next day.  I love the low-key, clean atmosphere.  You could go there in jeans or a formal gown and feel at home.    The bar area had soccer playing on the TV, and a group of fans, but they were not rowdy in the least.  Great mix of people whenever we go.  Plan to go back soon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Delish! As usual! But the taste is nothing ""usual"". While their BBQ sauces are good(they have 6 different choices), the food is so perfectly cooked it doesn't even need sauce. Just the right amount of smokiness. Not too much, not too little.  If you happen to be there when they have the smoked prime rib special....GET IT! Worth every penny!!! But my go to's are, turkey or salmon. I know, I know, salmon at a BBQ place. But trust me. It's the best I've ever had. Brisket is delicious too. My sons favorite. They ask if you want lean or moist. We say ""in between"". No where near dry but not fatty either. Again, flavor so delicious no sauce is needed.  Sides are amazing too...plenty of choices. Staff is welcoming and polite. There's actually always  someone at the counter serving that seems to take so much pride in his job, you'd think he owns the place. Unusual in today's world but impressive. Appreciated!  Maybe the best ""quick food"" restaurant around. The only thing that might be better is if they put this store in Wesley Chapel.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"As soon as you walk in, you are greeted by the aromatic smell and the chattering of the motherland. Bun Bo Hue is probably my favorite Vietnamese noodle dish so I was super excited about trying a place that specializes in it. Let me introduce to you our Bun Bo Hue crew: myself a BBH Expert (just eating, I can't make it), a BBH Amateur who had it a few times in his life and a BBH Virgin who came here to pop his Bun Bo Hue cherry.   We were seated quickly on a Sunday because we came before the lunch rush. We all ordered the special with everything in it, including the pork feet. The broth was aromatic and flavorful. The noodles had great texture and they loaded our bowls with tons of meat. You can adjust your spice level by requesting a side of chili oil (ot sate). They were pretty generous with the side vegetables and herbs. Service was mediocre, but it's an ethnic Asian spot so that's expected. My rule of thumb, the more mediocre the service is at an Asian restaurant, the better and more authentic the food will be.   After several consecutive foodgasms and streams of sweat rolling down our faces, the Bun Bo Hue crew, which consisted of various levels of Bun Bo Hue consumers, collectively decided to give this place a double thumbs up! I really appreciated the authenticity of the Bun Bo Hue here. They didn't try to water it down or Americanize it. There were plenty of fish sauce, fish paste and ethnic ingredients in that bowl to take you back to the streets of 'Nam.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"My husband and I stopped here after work last Friday night for a drink. It was earlyish and we sat at the beautiful bar. I ordered the La Que Pica cocktail. La Que Pica is Spanish for ""best drink ever."" Actually I think it translates to ""the itchy."" I can see why - it's fresh, minty, spicy, citrusy - you're not sure what you're tasting except it's lovely. A good itch. They make all their drinks with fresh juice. I was watching the machine behind the bar that juices all the citrus - it's a bit mesmerizing.   We ordered tacos - I mushroom and my husband fish. We got three tacos each, a generous portion in my mind. They were so tasty. The right amount of spice but with sauce if you wanted more sting.   We stayed about 90 minutes, talked with the friendly staff and other guests. It was homey and nice. We felt so welcome. We will be back often!

I keep getting the grilled cheese because it's so good and I keep craving it, but I'll try other things eventually. It says it's on the kids' menu, but don't worry, it's really filling! I wasn't as impressed during my second visit because I ordered the grilled cheese to-go and didn't get any kale chips with it. But they put tomato on the sandwich for free if you ask! If you go there on a Monday, you can get free soy soft-serve (chocolate, vanilla, or swirl).

Your logo and interior is honestly the farthest thing from what one would associate with a burger joint.  I drove by this place hundreds of times and didn't even realize it was a burger place until I looked closely. Blue snowy mountains? How did this get approved as your logo?

I ordered the Spicy Lamb Bolognese and my wife had the Homemade Crab Ravioli in a cream sauce. The food was so good I used the bread and wiped up every last drop of sauce. The atmosphere was authentic old world italian. Our server and the service was excellent. The best part was when all the servers (all trained opera singers mind you) take turns and sing an opera aria. I'm not an opera person, but this put an exclamation point on the meal and wrapped a bow around the entire evening. I didn't want to leave! I topped it off with Tiramisu and a Chocolate Martini.

"This place will not disappoint!!! Great atmosphere, great prices, and great food!!  Came here around lunch time and it wasn't too crowded. The lunch specials are around ~10 bucks and comes with soup or salad. I did not opt for the lunch menu, but my 2 friends did and were not disappointed either.  Instead, I got the kai soi gai. I had no idea what this was, but I was in the mood for some broth noodles so I went with it. It is SO good. The description says there are soba noodles, but it's more like ramen noodles. The broth is thick but not so heavy that you'll feel too full. It's a bit spicy, but more so sweet and curry tasting. Even with my low tolerance for spice, I did not find the dish to be spicy at all! The broth has such a rich taste and the curry taste is not overbearing. I HIGHLY recommend this dish and I will definitely go back to get it again. The portions are just right!!   My friend tried the pad Thai and said that it was very solid!!!!   We also got the summer rolls and fried spring rolls, which were both amazing as well. Our total bill with three entrees, two appetizers, and three Thai iced teas came out to be just a little under 60 bucks, which I thought was such a good deal !!!!!!!

"As a vegan it's actually a bit tricky to eat Indian food as they use a lot of ""ghee"" (clarified butter) - but this place is always extremely accommodating and quick to point out what I can or cannot eat.  The buffet is great and I always seem to find at least a few great vegan dishes, they have even made something special on the side for me on multiple occasions when the selection was lacking, at no additional cost.  The naan is also included in the buffet and I swear it's unlimited, you can get coconut, garlic, plain or buttered naan. Since we're vegan we would just get the plain naan but the fact you could get fresh naan throughout your buffet was awesome.  The service is great, the food is awesome, and I will definitely be coming back whenever I want Indian food - word to the wise, stay away from the house wine, it's definitely the boxed kind.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I went to their website (where they so kindly have a menu!) and I was shocked at the prices!! They were pretty inexpensive (which I wasn't expecting) We (the boy and I) just wanted a nibble in the afternoon, so we got the Chicken Satay appetizer (3.95!!) and Teriyaki Chicken (7.95) the portions were decent for two people! (not a full meal if you're a hearty eater and planning on splitting one entree) but I WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HEAVEN HAVING ONE TO MYSELF.   It was so good I was honestly just eating spoonfulls of sauce. it's disgusting in theory, but not in practice for their sauce :)   I suggest trying it out, it's in a strip mall which is easy to get in and out of (thank god!), it's inexpensive and it was soooo good.

"Wife and I tried out Baytenders last week. Was very delicious and a great new seafood option in the 4th St corridor.  The grouper nuggets had a light batter and were cooked extremely well, and the conch fritters were very good, though personally, I prefer Fish Tales' large fritters. With the regular sized fritter most of the taste is fried batter and the sauce.  We also ordered the Blue Crab Claws (amazing) and the Clams Casino which for me, someone who never eats mollusks in shell were absolutely... not clammy. A great balance of cheese and other flavors with the clam.  But the stand out (good or bad, jury is out for me) was the crab bisque. There is a ridiculous amount of alcohol in it. It was not disgusting, but you really feel like you're drinking a gravy cocktail which is not what I was looking for or expecting. Try a sample before you order. That said, I kept finding myself taking small bites of it before we sent it back for another option.  Aesthetic wise, if you remember Fred Flemings that was in this location before this is basically the opposite. Fit, finish and theming is up there with something you'd find in Orlando, but compliments rather than overcompensating for the dishes.

Dan is a terrific bartender, and made us feel very welcome and chatted with us while we ate our cheese fries drink our cocktails.  It was one of the better experiences I've ever had any Ruby Tuesday's. We will definitely go again, the cheese fries were so good I'd make a special trip just for those. The dish started with crispy french fries covered with bacon, a spicy cheese sauce and some ranch for dipping. They were absolutely delicious!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"We stopped in this place last weekend because it came highly recommended. We were not disappointed. Received a warm greeting when we walked in. Our host told us some of the history here and the whole staff was obviously proud of the place. Beatriz was our server. Always smiling and giving fast service. The sonoran dogs were  great.  So today we are back in Tucson and came back for round 2. More sonoran dogs and this time tried carne asada taco and bean taco as well. Both very good. Beatriz is still smiling, the beer is still cold and the food is still great.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Loved it. The french onion soup is amazing, and makes for a great app. The beer is WONDERFUL! Dragoon Brewery does and excellent job, and 47 Scott is very lucky to have their brand. Kept it simple, and had the burger and a side of mac and cheese, the burger was great, but the mac and cheese was a little bland. Our server, Chuck, did very well, kept a smile and was attentive.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
A quick trip to Philadelphia and a vegan tour guide lead us to this amazing pizza location.  As a New Yorker I am suspicious of lots of things but most of all Pizza.  Blackbird was above and beyond the best vegan Pizza I have had the opportunity of investigating and devouring.  I loved the downtown location and I super loved the dive rock star feel of the place.  Nothing flashy going on because who needs all that when the pizza holds up all on its own.    the Boyfriend and I got a small Nacho and Fungi pizza and both were delicious. The cheese was creamy and the toppings were fresh.  I recommend this place to visitors and locals alike.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Wow!  Our experience here was amazing.  We made reservations about three months in advance for our office holiday party, and it was our best dinner yet.  First, our table was excellent - right next to the large kitchen windows where we could watch the chefs preparing everything.  Secondly, our server Mark was phenomenal. He handled all of our whims and requests without blinking an eye, joking and laughing with us, staying on top of food and cocktails the entire night, and generally being perfect.  Finally the food.  So delicious! We started with their version of seafood tower with lobster claws, oysters, crab and shrimp.  Everything was cooked perfectly, with the highlight, to me, being the crab.  My entree of surf and turf, with not one but TWO lobster tails, and filet was perfection. I loved all the family-style side dishes we shared, but my surprising favorite was the creamed spinach.  Asparagus, brussels sprouts, and loaded mashed potatoes were also excellent.  My dessert of carrot cake was okay - I loved that our server actually heated it slightly with a butane torch. My favorite dessert however was the butter cake.  Yum!  Fabulous experience from start to finish, and I loved every minute of it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Crushed Red is my go-to spot for lunch during the work week. They get very busy around noon as you would expect, but they are extremely efficient. From the time you place your order, it takes at most five minutes before you're checked out with salad in hand. On top of that, the food is fantastic. They have a few signature salads that are super creative and and extremely craveable. I constantly have hankerings for This Pear Is On Fire and their BBQ chicken salad, among others. Their soups are also surprisingly good for a fast casual place. The flatbreads I've had were good, but I mostly stick to the salads. Bonus points for their efforts to minimize waste in every way possible. I will keep coming back as long as I'm in the area. Keep doing what you're doing, Crushed Red, and don't change a thing.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

It also came with 3 pieces of bread: 2 for the fish and 1 for the wings.   I called in advance to place my order and they said it would be about 10 minutes.

But if you prefer more heat, just remember to ask.  The portions are large, which is great because I get to eat it again for dinner the next day. I've gotten take out/delivery many times, which has always been reliable. It's a nice place to dine in as well, especially in the summer when you can sit outside. Service is attentive and helpful.

"This place just opened in Edwardsville and it was about time for some decent ""Americanized"" Asian food. I think they are trying to make this a fast food ""P.F. Changs"" and that's fine by me. The menu is relatively limited but it's perfect, because it has all the goodies you need! The place is rather small, but that's fine. So you go in, you sit, you take a look at the menu, then you go to the cashier order and pay, then get your drink and silverware, then they serve it and you are done. The things I tried were delicious, I got the chicken fried rice and my friend got the Kung Pao chicken, both delish! We also got the lettuce wraps- totally the same taste as in P.F.

"After hearing good things about Taqueria San Luis, I decided to make the trek this afternoon.    As I drove down Harding, I saw off to the side a giant sign that said San Luis and I turned into my destination.    Taquieria San Luis shares 1/8 of a carnerceria off of Harding Place.  It is not a restaurant, but really just a window that you order tacos from and a wooden ledge on the side of the building where you can stand and eat the tacos at.  If you are expecting a full restaurant you're in the wrong place.  Fortunately for me the weather was in the mid-70s so perfect for taco eating.  The first thing that inspired me was a trailer full of whole dead pigs with one guy in the trailer walking around them and another taking them out and into the Carnerceria.  Having the animal you are about to eat exist in preprocessed form is encouraging.  The menu has two items, tacos and burritos and the type of meat you want in them.  I went with some tacos al pastor and some with chorizo and a chorizo burrito.    The tacos were amazing.  The tacos are just the meat on top of tortillas with some onions, cilantro, and a slice of lime. The pork of the al pastor was tender yet juicy, with a slightly sweet and spicy flavor.  The chorizo more spicy but when combined with the lime juice a delicious meshing of flavor occured.  My only real issue was with the chorizo burrito.  The burrito had the addition of cheese on it which I thought detracted immensely from the flavor of the meat.  If I did it again I would either order no cheese on it, or just stick with tacos only.  Overall though, the tacos and the possibility of a delicious burrito do not take away from the deserved 5 star rating.  This has been the best Mexican food I've had in Nashville.  Highly recommended and worth the drive.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"OMG I can't believe I've lived in the close area of this Fine Restaurant...there was five of us having dinner after Me and My Wife were Married.  We started off with really good Drinks, I had the Wodka Martini Dirty(wodka is the brand of vodka I believe) and it went real well with the Blue Point Oyster App my Mother-In-Law and I shared which were salty and awesome and incredibly Fresh and tasty. When our Server brought our Main Dishes he commented about how he heard we had some huge Oysters placde in with the regular sized ones and said that was very rare to have. Either way the were fresh and that's all I can ask for. Now my main dish was the Filet Mignon Skewers that I believe to be at least 9oz and that  melted in my mouth along side Coconut Rice and Black Beans. My Wife had the Tempura Shrimp that had 12 Huge Shrimp and I of course had two. My Mom had what I think they call it the Caribbean Salmon which you know what I'm gonna say, Huge and Spicie. She wasn't expecting that but she loved it. Mother-in-law had a Flatebread with Goat Cheese and all kinds of nice stuff and was the size of a Pizza. Father-in-law had what I had. The Staff was very friendly and nice, our Waiter was very knowledgeable of the Menu. Oh and inside is very modern and clean, I heard good things about the Ladies Room. Lol. The only letdown and negative thing I can say about Marlin Darlin is that I didn't come here and eat sooner. I believe I dont have to drive out of my way anymore anywhere else to get an outstanding Diner out.

From the moment we walked through the door of the colorful, cozy space, we felt a genuine sense of warmth and welcoming from the owners. We seated ourselves in one of the corner window cubbies, and co-owner Jen came right over to personally welcome us and suggest menu items. I ordered the breakfast scramble, and the roll, scramble, and especially the little crispy potatoes that come on the side were so filling and delicious. My best friend ordered an avocado toast and enjoyed it equally; and we both sipped on warm golden milk kava. I even bought a to-go double apple cider kava as a gift for my neighbor. Lightbox is a plant-based cafe that provides its customers with healthy, filling options; a booze-free environment and alternative to bar culture; and an authentic sense of community. Furthermore, it's owned and operated by two incredible people who are deeply invested in the neighborhood.

"This was one of our first Indy restaurants when we moved here in 2015.  But we weren't doing Yelp back then. So this review is the result of several visits.    The owners, Gina and Tom are soooo friendly.  They usually make it around to visit with everyone, often sitting down in an open seat to chat.  Such a welcoming and warm atmosphere.  Gina is an artist and has filled the place with beautiful art. Both paintings and ceiling mobiles.   The seating is a mix of booths (with movable tables) and wooden tables.  There is also a counter with a few high seats. There is also some seating outside on the sidewalk.  We primarily come for breakfast but have been for dinner twice.  So we didn't eat all of this food in one visit. :-) They have good fried biscuits. Very good corned beef hash (not always available). Pancake was good. Very good bacon. TaterTot scramble was good but too many tots for us.    The biscuits and gravy were good.   Good western egg white omelet.  Bacon was very good, crisp.  Burrito was good with sausage gravy and potatoes on the side. The Athens omelette was great.  My new favorite.  The pancake with pecans was good.  The breakfast potatoes (diced) were ok, nothing special.   Prices are very reasonable. Many entree choices under $10, still get sides.

"I got the chicken lo mein and curry chicken from this restaurant. They were both delicious and averagely priced for the area.  I might have found my new favorite Chinese take-out place!  The lo mein tastes almost pan fried. It wasn't drowning in sauce, but the flavor was all in the noodles. The curry was yummy too, with the vegetables not being overcooked at all. The chicken was plentiful, soft and tender for both dishes. They didn't skimp at all!  The curry here was not very spicy, so be sure to ask for extra heat if that's what you're into!  Pick-up was quick (15 minutes for the food to be ready after placing the order), easy and pandemic-safe (a small window to accept your food and pay for it, so you don't have to go into the restaurant at all).  My only complaint is that the neighborhood seems a little dicey. I went to pick-up my food with my boyfriend close to 10pm, and I didn't feel completely safe. (Nothing happened though!)

"This place was awesome! We were able to put our name down and check our place in line using Yelp, which meant we got to stroll around and explore while we waited for a table. The wait for 2 was about 30 min at 11am on a Friday morning. We ordered the skinny miga, which was so satisfying with the soft texture of the scramble and the crunchy tortilla strips. If you want to get the french toast cinammon sticks, they are similar to churros and it is best to share among a few friends as they are very sweet. We could barely have 2 of them and boxed the rest. The sweet vanilla cold coffee is refreshing and not overly sweet. This is a great brunch option in the Quarter for vegetarians as they don't focus on the typical New Orleans seafood here.

"We are in town for a convention and this was suggested as a place with some local appeal. We generally don't expect much in these situations but we were so, so pleased with not only the service and friendliness of the staff but with the incredible food.   We had the chicken dumplings which were served in a steamer basket with shredded carrots and a nice ginger/soy sauce. There are only four in the order so you may want more if you have a larger party.   Our meal consisted of the burger which was suggested by the staff and the greek salad with chicken. The burger almost appeared to be an after thought on the menu as everything else had more flair to it but don't be fooled! This was truly one of the very best burgers I have had including those at Mortons and Capital Grille. To top it off, the fries were fantastic.   The salad was very will done with a large piece of chicken and plenty of greens. In fact, it could have been shared by two people as we had a bit left over even after sharing. Wonderful dressing and a nice balance of flavors.  While there were several interesting items on the desert menu, we opted for the Grasshopper hoping that this wouldn't be the usual brownie with a slab of ice cream. Again, we were more than pleased with the smaller portion, homemade (hot) brownie and fantastic ice cream. It was the perfect finish to the entire meal.  Don't be fooled by the somewhat pedestrian sound of the meal. They did a fantastic job using high-end ingredients, lots of care and perfect preparations. Great work!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"So the pizza here is really good. Probably the best pizza I have found in Philly after moving here from Chicago. Thin crust. Sauce that actually has some flavor to it. But more than that they have always been extremely helpful and courteous when they make a mistake (I have ordered from here a lot...). They are also accommodating to vegans, just make sure to ask for no cheese if you get the old fashioned tomato pie. Seriously good food and great service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I'm from LA and like to check out restaurants when I visit my daughter who attends college in the area. Yes, their cocktails are good, which didn't surprise me given the name of the restaurant. But it was hard for me to believe that I found one of my best all-around food experiences tucked away in a suburb. My daughter and I order a few share plates, and each one was executed very well. I love tuna crudos when each bite gives you something slightly different in flavor and/or texture and yet is still tastes perfectly balanced. The dish relied nicely on acidity (I assume from citrus) with a ""pop"" of salt here and there (I assume from kosher salt). We also had the tongue & cheek tacos, avocado & burrata flatbread, and pork ribs. Each dish was cooked well (especially the pork ribs, which was crisped on the outside and was tender on the inside) and nicely seasoned. I look forward to going back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Yum, yum, yum,YUM! Seriously, look at my reviews I don't just give out an automatic 5 stars. But this place, every thing I have ordered has been on point. Apparently, they have been here for about 11 years. This is now my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. I was next door at vPho and decided to check out Compadres and I'm glad I did. The man at the front is named Victor; he was polite, friendly and helpful. The place is clean with ample seating and they have a TV in the corner.  I have ordered their lengua torta which was really good (their bread was soft and fresh!) and tonight upon recommendation from Victor I ordered their chicken ranchero with corn tortillas (which were the best I have ever had.) I had never ordered it before but all the ingredients were delicious. The ladies at the grill are doing some special back there. This food is fresh and it feels healthier. Like I don't feel all bogged down like how you would eating some Mexican joints. Their hibiscus drink was a littler sweeter than I like. But their chips and salsa were great (complimentary even at take-out.)   The one thing I love about eating foods from different cultures, is so many things up are for interpretation. I have never had a taco salad with broccoli and carrots but it was fantastic. I ordered it for my mom and I tried it and it was the healthiest taco salad I have ever eaten. It was not greasy, there was no sour cream.....it was great. And there was a little Mexican cheese as the bottom which was great to mix around with the chicken and vegetables. Their green sauce is on point! Gotta have that kick!  I have been here twice in less than 2 weeks and I will continue to try more and more items.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"We took our daughter out for her 40th birthday.  We were greeted with complementary flutes of champagne, and a free dessert for her.  Open, airy, socially distanced gave a feeling of comfort. (unfortunately, we could NOT schedule a heated outdoor 'igloo' table, surrounded with plastic, and well heated).   Staff was very attentive, food was magnificent. The spicings made familiar dishes taste just a little different, with a 'Solstice' touch.  For instance the Bouillabaisse had all the traditional tomato-y tastes, but still maintained a signature tang.  Short ribs and scallops were also SO good. They had a good variety of speciality drinks to start off with.  Moderately pricey, (this is Newtown!) but a great place to share special occasions.  If you can, you may want to ask for the 'igloo' seating outside, though we were warned, they got a little chilly in extreme cold temps.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

Pretty sure its toasted in butter. The mac and cheese was so creamy and you can taste a little spice so I'm assuming there was some pepper jack in there. Idk but its was bomb!

"Our first time out since covid and I was afraid I was going to act like a wild animal...but I didn't. Have been wanting to try this place and so glad that we did. We sat out on the patio, which was really nice. Lots of good distance between the tables and everybody was an upbeat mood and happy and ready to do their thing. The chips are phenomenal as any good Mexican restaurant should be, thin and crispy salty. The salsa was bomb, this might be the best salsa I have ever had. You could tell it was homemade, there were little pieces of chard tomato in there and lots of good flavor not too spicy, A+. The queso, the flavor was amazing but it was a little bit thin.   I had the chorizo tacos. They were really good. Nice and fully staffed. Lots of good flavor. My only wish is that they would provide a variety of tacos. When you order tacos you can only get three of one kind. If you order tacos à la carte, the only choices are ground beef and chicken.  My partner ordered the chicken with cheese and spinach, everything was delicious.  Now let's talk drinks, the margaritas are dope. We ordered three regular margaritas and then two jumbo margaritas to-go. #LivingOurBestLife   they have lots of flavors. We tried watermelon, banana, peach, and the premium one.  The atmosphere is fun and the people there were really nice. Ended up having a conversation with the table next to us had a really good time.

Next time I went I got the Captain and then #RipFries and cheese sauce again because they were delicious. My roommate got the regular fries (also great) and a classic with 2 patties.   I recommend the #RipFries if you like sweet and spicy things, they aren't too spicy which I like and with the cheese sauce, they are just chefs kiss! The patties are thin because they are smashed burgers so I think it's ideal to get at least 2 but think 3 might be the perfect amount.   I'm hoping to try the donut burger that they only serve on Sundays too! And will definitely be a regular at Macs going forward.

I grow poblano peppers to make this dish myself, Javier's Mama cannot be praised highly enough for her creation.

"I am going to be 100% sincere, I had wanted to take Novio to Fusion Bowl for dinner as a celebration but as I checked online I noticed it was closed minuted before we arrived. Big caca on my part, but life goes on so I quickly got on yelp and looked for a new place to celebrate Friday. That's when I found Anise Global Gastrobar, it has great ratings so we decided to give it a try. We arrived promptly at 5:50 and parked at a Pay to Park which I believe is free after 6 pm.    It was relatively empty with only three other pairs, it wasn't prime time yet. We were seated at a two person table and were gleefully attended by our amazing server Laura. This place has a great happy hour from 5 to 7 which includes a large variety of drinks at low prices, including Moscow Mules (which as you know soothes my tummy) but Novio and I decided to treat ourselves and order Mojitos. Laura said they were Amazing and she was right. It was our first time here so we asked her for recommendations on dished. Disclaimer: THEY HAVE SO MANY CHOICES, tapas, dinner, shareables! Laura did a great job suggesting dishes, we went with the baked goat cheese first and told her to give us a little time till the next dish. IT WAS DELICIOUS, toasted baguette baked goat cheese with tomato, olives and garlic, yuuuum. We ran out of bread, another baguette is an additional $1, no problem.   For our second plate we ordered Duck Tacos (it comes with two tacos) , we were in between those and the stinky buns but Novio lost at Rock, Paper, Scissors, so we got the Duck. They smelled funky due to the dressing but they were oh so good. Again, Laura gave us time in between dishes to decide what the next step would be.  For our last meal we ordered the Jap Chae (gluten free noodles) with beef. Novio and I shared that cause I would not have been able to eat a whole plate. It was so good that Novio said he should have ordered one for himself. We were so full by the end of the meal that we did not order dessert, and that's a big deal for me cause I love me some sweets.   The place got really full after 6 but Laura remained attentive and there whenever necessary. It is relatively affordable if you know what and how to order, out bill was basically half food and half mojitos (we ordered four). It was delicious, I can't wait to go back and try the stinky buns and desserts!!!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"My husband and I were married at the AWH on Sept 4th, 2015.  It was one of the best days of our lives.  We picked the AWH based on the food, flat usable space, ambiance, cost and the ability to make this day unique to our vision.  Our Ceremony started at 5:30pm and ended at 11pm.  We are foodies so JAM catering was a perfect fit.  The food is simply amazing. We decided on beef short ribs and mahi mahi.  Our guest still rave about it.  Nothing like typical wedding food.  The cake was perfection.  Stations were beautiful and there was plenty of food.  Our guest did not want to leave the cocktail hour!  The space was a perfect size.  We were married outside and exchanged our own vows under a wooden pergola.  I will never forget it as long as I live.  The outdoor space was great for cocktails, yard games and the general flow of guests.  Never crowded.  The elderly were able to get around as well.  Few steps.  The road AWH sits on is not loud.  You feel very secluded.  The ambiance is perfection.  Beautiful and rustic.  The old colonial house is a beautiful backdrop.  The fire pit created a relaxed atmosphere.  The tent was breath taking.  This place needs very little extra fluff to shine.  The tent is on polished concrete.  Plenty of room for tables and dancing.  There are 2 bars very close to the tent.  I did not want my guests to have to walk all over creation.   The cost was very reasonable.  We looked at 17 different places.  This gave us everything we were looking for and at the best cost per head.  JAM catering was more than willing to work with us and talk about any financial concerns.  I do feel like we got our monies worth.  Our onsite coordinator Angela, answered all of our questions and was helpful the day of the wedding along with the rest of her team.  Khasera did a great job as well.  The team helped us clean out of there.  Our wedding was exactly what we were going for. Relaxed, delicious and an absolute great party.  Forget the formalities.

It does have some character of its own, particularly due to the friendly and helpful staff.  The reason for the five stars was the sandwiches, particularly the Philly cheese steak.  They are huge, full of meat, tasty, and decently-priced.  My wife and I made the mistake of ordering a 20 inch to split, thinking we would stack all the meat in half the sandwich.

Staff was very friendly, owners are very personable and get to know their customers, the counter girl was very sweet, seemed to enjoy her job and put a smile or get a laugh out of every costumer that walks through the door, cooks always say thank you when handing out the food, very friendly people.

"Just had take-out for the very first time. It was soooo good! My in-laws come here often, and had offered to pick up some Chinese and bring it over to drop off for us tonight. I wasnt ensure about trying anew place during a Pandemic, but appreciated the gift from my in-laws. Let me tell you! It was the best Chinese food I've had in probably a couple years. Lately most places have gotten really greasy, and the food all kind of tastes alike. Not this! The shrimp roll was a shrimp roll. Egg roll was an egg roll. The chow mein was fabulous. The sweet and sour chicken amazing- and again-  NO HEARTBURN!!!   Wr will definitely be back. I think this is our new go-to spot for Chinese!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"My husband and I recently moved here from LA California and decided to give this place a try after passing by a few times on our way to work.   The place was clean and the people very welcoming. After reviewing the menu we decided to do two appetizers and two rolls. We went with the beef gyoza and spicy rock shrimp. The gyoza was good and we fell in love with the spicy rock shrimp. The wasabi sauce was delicious! For rolls we had the Fishtown and Liberty, and we were not disappointed. Both rolls were delicious and tasted fresh! We ended the night with delicious mochi!   The five stars we are giving is for the over all experience. The food was delicious but what stood out for us was the people working there. Throughout the entire meal the severs were very attentive and very nice. We even learned about some of the ingredients they use from Japan to make their delicious sauces.

"If you're a cocktail or spirits drinker, please visit Beer NV!  You read that right. It's not just beer and cider here. This is a full bar bar AND they take their spirits and cocktails very seriously!   This is nothing new, and you know that if you've been coming here for a while. But if you've passed this place or read some reviews and somehow missed this fact, I'm sharing it now, loudly, so everyone knows this is a super cool spot for drinkers of all kinds.  We stopped by on Memorial Day and found a pretty chill and quiet scene. We got a few seats at one of the high top communal tables and first thing I noticed was that the spirits corner had moved up front.   I scanned the cocktail menu and orders up a tequila cocktail that's a summery riff on a corpse reviver and then poked my head around the corner to see what they had to offer. Not only did I find the great spirits selection I've come to know here I also found a feature board with not one, but two amazing allocated whiskies being poured at amazingly appropriate prices AND another specialty cocktail with Japanese whisky too.   The tequila drink was good, but it drank a little on the heavy side. I was surprised it was served up in a coupe (fancy glass) because reading the description I thought it would be served over ice. The menu may have mentioned that and I overlooked it. I actually think it would've been more enjoyable on ice because I wanted it to dilute a bit.   The Japanese whisky cocktail was delicious and refreshing. Served over, it was like a whisky sour flavored with umeshu or sweet plumb wine, and it was delicious.  The group also enjoyed the bourbon and watermelon cocktail as well. Perfect summer drink with a hint of mint!  Gosh.

There is table seating indoors and a few outside if you can stand the heat and humidity.   The croissant breakfast sandwich is really popular, but check their specials board. This time I had their special house-made corned beef hash, fried eggs with Yukon potatoes and rye. So phenomenally good!  Even with a full house, service is totally down home N'Awlins and neighborhood friendly. Coffee and condiments are self serve.

"Definitely a great Chipotle. It's hard to rate chain restaurants because a lot of the things you would rate them on are beyond their control - Pricing, menu, etc. However you can talk about how well they served you. The staff here is always super nice. I definitely see familiar faces when I come in here. They also do a great job of preparing the food. It's packed and not sloppily played. They also maintain a great level of cleanliness that other Chipotles are lacking. One staff member in particular , he's usually on register goes out of the way for the guests and went around to personally check in with customers when there was no longer a line. Nice touch and he wasn't pushy! Overall, good Chipotle stop! Oh and I like the actual setup of this store.

"I stopped off to Oakley's Grill for lunch the other day after discovering I'd purchased a $5 for $10 deal through Living Social.  I had seen the restaurant before, but I had yet to venture in even though a number of coworkers had recommended it.  They all said the service was super friendly, accommodating, and that the food was pretty yummy, too.  I'll start with the decor.  The restaurant is fairly new, and as a result, the decor isn't quite finished yet (at least I don't think it is).  It's fairly plain, but it has a neat, clean quality to it that means it doesn't necessarily make a difference that there aren't a bunch of things on the walls.  The service is fantastic.  Upon simply walking in, I was greeted by a man that turned out to be the owner who introduced himself to me, flashed me a welcoming grin, and proceeded to point out that he hadn't seen me in the restaurant before.  He asked if I was new, and I confirmed that I was.  He then talked me through the menu options, their methods of cooking, and just about anything else I could have thought to ask about the restaurant.  It was very, very nice!  It's clear that service and making the customer feel welcome is this restaurant's priority.  It didn't stop with the owner either!  There was a gentleman slicing mushrooms (fresh, I might add!), and he talked to me while my order was being prepared (again, fresh and made to order!).  It was a very pleasant conversation.  Now, the other important part:  the food.  I ordered a standard, Angus beef cheeseburger with french fries and a drink.  I was presented with options on preparation of my burger, and they didn't disappoint.  The burger (medium-well) was done perfectly with flavor, juice, and mouth watering.  The french fries were lightly seasoned and not dripping in oil.    Overall, this was a fantastic first impression, and I'd recommend it to anyone!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

The space is beautiful and the food was incredible. We definitely over ordered, but were happy to take home the leftovers. We started with the chicken murmuri rolls ($8 for 4) and Calcutta pork ribs ($10 for 4) - both were delicious and unlike foods we had tried before. For our main course, we shared the lamb roganjosh ($21) - tender, generous chunks of lamb in a spicy (but not too spicy) stew-like sauce, the chicken makhani ($19) which was seriously the best, creamiest tikka masala style sauce I've ever had, and of course delicious, almost fluffy garlic naan ($3 for 4 pieces).

"Panda King is well known for it's tradition dim sum, but tonight I experienced what's behind door number two. Literally, next to the dim sum restaurant is a separate entrance to a completely different world. It's a large dining room that is setup with two options. On the right is a gigantic buffet and on the left is a dining area dedicated to a unique hot pot dining experience. This review is about my hot pot experience.  The hot pot concept is not new to me, but Panda King's implementation is exciting and unique. I've never seen anything like this.The tables are custom built so that each diner has their own built-in burner. There is a simple control that is used to control the heat to your burner. This allows each person to choose their own soup base and to build their own hot pot.  The protocol is simple, but can be intimidating for the first time. Luckily, our waitress and the staff were very very helpful. There are four steps. Order your soup base, order from a list of raw proteins (that you will share), select add-ins that are pushed around the restaurant (dim sum cart style), and use sauces and seasonings from a dip station. So, let me break this down.  First, you choose your soup base from one of six different broths. The most popular are the Spicy Thai Tom Yum and the Beef broth. As the meal progresses the waitress will add more hot broth. I chose the Thai Tom Yum. It was good, not too spicy or too sour.  Our table of six ordered four proteins to share. The brisket, pork belly, short ribs, and scallops. The meats are thinly sliced and presented in perfectly stacked rolls. It was an impressive presentation, and an effective way to get individual pieces of meat. The thin cuts cook very quickly in your boiling stock. But, we agreed that our meat selections tasted the same after being cooked. The scallops were giant, and the were good. Four orders were plenty for our party.  The highlight to me was the push carts that came to your table with add-ins. The carts contain an endless variety of different items. Some examples were: mushrooms, noodles, dumplings, green vegetables, and seafoods. Add-ins are served on plates that contain enough to share. As I mentioned the cart order technique is very much like at dim sum. As you order, the wait staff marks a tally on your order sheet.  The last item to describe is the dip station. You visit this before your meal begins. The stations contains at least a dozen different seasonings and dipping sauces. As an example, I got some freshly chopped garlic, mix of minced peppers, and a hot chilli paste.  Our experience was fabulous. It is an interactive, social event that everyone enjoyed. We ordered an insane amount of food because everything looked so good. And, I was surprised by how affordable our dinner was. With tip, our bill was approximately $100. I strongly recommend, and I hope you enjoy as much as we did.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Tucked away off the beaten path of the main drags, this is probably my favorite restaurant in the Broad Ripple area.  I can't comment much on the atmosphere inside the restaurant because we always eat outside.  So I've only experienced the inside in passing.  They have great outdoor seating!  I don't think I have ever left here disappointed and this trip was no exception.  We got the special appetizer of the day which was fried green tomatoes served with their fire sauce.  The tomatoes were crisp, golden and yummy.  The fire sauce was a great compliment to the tomatoes and is also great with their fries.   We split the five slices of fried green tomatoes between 4 people and I have to confess, I almost ordered another round.  But I restrained myself knowing that my entree would be arriving soon.  And I am so glad I did!  It would have been just downright wrong not to have had any appetite left over for the main dish!  I ordered the special which was grilled salmon in a light Chipotle agave sauce topped with a spinach poblano creme served on a bed of rice mixed with some veggies and black beans topped with grilled asparagus.

Love ClusterTruck!! I had the baked Mac and cheese and bbq pulled pork sandwich from The Mug. SO GOOD. And actually hot and fresh upon opening. I was thinking the bbq sandwich might be a little soggy and it wasn't one bit! The baked Mac with the crusty Parmesan topping is a must. And delivery omg! My meal came within probably 20 minutes of ordering. Ordered around 7pm on a Saturday night. And you don't even have to pay delivery fee if you meet the driver outside. Done and done.

"When it comes to steak, I'm not easy to please. I'm probably one of the snobbiest carnivores around, so when I say that I'm blown away by a piece of beef, you know it's damn good. Well hats off to the Butcher & Singer chefs for literally serving me the best steak I've had in recent memory.   Started the meal with a blue-cheese stuffed olive martini - fantastic way to whet the palette - and noshed on some Oysters Rockefeller before splitting their Tomato & Onion and Butcher Salads. The former featured deliciously ripe tomatoes smothered in Roquefort Bleu Cheese and the most thinly sliced Vidalia onions; while the latter was a deliciously light chopped salad containing crisp lettuce, chickpeas, green beans, some sopressata salami, and various other ingredients that, although intimidatingly filling sounding at first, was a really light intro. The dressing was somewhat sweet, but not in an overwhelming way.   Then came the steak. We shared the 20oz. Porterhouse for two, priced reasonably at $74. It. Was. Awesome. Prepared perfectly medium-rare with a charred outer edge that was so flavorful, I literally stopped mid bite to pinch myself. No, I wasn't dreaming. Yes, it was real steak and yeah, it was THAT good. And the brussel sprout side? They are literally the tastiest green side i've ever had - they are almost deconstructed and served sauteed w/ applewood smoked bacon. The server actually said, ""I want to let you know that the brussel sprouts come with bacon, is that okay?"" I almost ordered a second serving when I heard that...   The decor of this steak house is also really enjoyable. It's in a massive space with high ceilings and though the lighting is pretty dim, it's not too dark like most steakhouses. There's a warmth about the place that makes eating here really comfortable. It also reminds me of one of those big band/swing joints you see in movies. I expected to see a live swing trio standing in individual booths there.  I think it's safe to say that this place may have just knocked Del Frisco's out of first place in my list of ""best steakhouses ever."" If you're in Philly and have a craving for meat, Butcher and Singer is a must!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I heard the baker at this new location was particularly skilled with croissants, and it happens that croissants are my favorite baked good.  The croissants at Handlebar downtown are my usual favorites - crispy and flaky -  though they are typically incredibly hollow inside. So I'm quite happy to say the croissants at this Crushcakes were prefect: flaky and with a perfectly-cooked, crispy outside, while also filled through-and-through with fluffy, buttery goodness.  My only complaint is there was only one left when I got there at 4 pm, though I understand that's a bit late for a bakery.  I asked the employee there about the issues in the first review: The owner does not have a golden retriever or any infants in her family. California law protects the rights of customers to breastfeed in public, including in restaurants; and in my personal opinion I can't fathom anyone who gets up in arms about something as normal as a baby eating.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I go out of my way to stop here. The food has great flavor, portions are large, and the price is right. My happiness starts with the fresh lime slice in my water, and continues as I watch the cooks make everything fresh - chopping limes, slicing meat, frying chips... I dream of this good - the guacamole, salsas, warm tortillas, flavorful rice & beans (I usually pass on those), flavorful meats and veggies...   They say the sign of a good ethnic restaurant is people of that nationality eating there. You will most definitely find that here. And don't panic if you end up with a menu on Spanish.

We had the pork belly as an appetizer and almost passed out with glee at the table. You can tell that every detail has been catered to. From the homemade rolls to the roasted garlic olive oil (definitely a tasty tidbit to spread on the rosemary roll), we thoroughly enjoyed every part of this meal.   My husband ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese. The lobster was poached beautifully and the fresh pappardelle noodles melted in your mouth.

"The BEST sandwich we've ever had.  I was browsing through yelp looking for places to eat when I came across Even Stevens sandwiches. I'm not a huge sandwich person but my boyfriend is. The ratings were good and we like to try new places so we went to Even Stevens for dinner. I quickly decided to order the Banh Mi---best decision ever!!! It comes on this awesome sub roll, cucumbers, jalapeños, a dressing to die for, and the most amazing pulled pork! My boyfriend got the ""capreezy"" with chicken which was also good. We opted for the side salad instead of chips. Their salad was fresh, tomatoes also fresh and the dressing they used was delish! Not sure which was a better accomplishment - for Even Stevens to have turned me (a non-sandwich eater) into a sandwich lover OR to have gotten my sandwich-loving boyfriend's vote as ""the best pulled pork sandwich he's ever had"" either way- go to Even Stevens and get the BANH MI!  You will not regret it   The inside is modern (somewhat of a hipster vibe but very clean) and the people working were friendly.  They told us about their live music and all-you-can-eat French toast on Sunday's. Lastly, they try to make sure they only use local items. Very cool!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Verti Marte has been back open for a couple years now.  The fire damage was completely repaired, with no visible residual & no odor.  This is the absolute best deal in town, prepared food-wise.  Chalkboard menu is out-of-date and confusing.  Little paper menus are sometimes available.  Best to look at items and ask, even if the order-taker seems rushed and harried.  Some of the best are ""country fried steak"", ""dirty rice"" rice dressing, meat lasagna, ""country corn"", spinach casserole, potato salad, meat loaf, mac & cheese, smothered greens, green beans, & potatoes au gratin.  Poor-boys are also very good.  Everything is good here, really good.  Servings are enormous; one meal can feed us two with leftovers.  Get one meal to go, with one extra entrée & a couple extra ""sides"" and eat for several days.  Caveats:  Tiny, very crowded, personnel may seem rude, no parking, no tables to eat-in.  Lines can be long, for long waits.  Plusses: Near parks & riverfront ""Moon Walk"" for picnics.  Coldbeer, wine, & half-pints of whiskey / rum / liquors at check-out counter.  Open all the day & night.  Delivers in immediate neighborhood & to hotels.    There are three food ""must-do's"" in today's New Orleans and this is one of them. The other two are Mandina's 3800 Canal & Muriel's on Jackson Square.  Don't miss this quirky, iconic ""Everyone's Favorite!""  Rick",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This is one of my all time favorite Mexican places in the St. Louis area. They have the usual stuff that you find at almost every other Mexican restaurant only the bonus is they have much more as well. A lot of the authenticate stuff has a very unique taste that I think some people either love or hate. I have had some friends who actually say they hate Senor Pique and I think its primarily because they have become a custom to the 'slop Mexican' style that most other places serve up.

"OK so it's 7ﾟ in the Sun and why not order barbecue on such a cold day. I have read that Salt and Smoke is one of the best BBQ restaurants in Missouri so using my trusty cell phone I went to their website and ordered ...Trashed ribs,  and Garlic & Herb French fries  From the Hampton location.... You have an option to order fried pickles I opted not to but lo and behold they put some in the order and needless to say quite good. I have never had them...  The fries were still hot if you can believe it and fabulous..  What also arrived was a pop over which was kind of unusual but it really had a good flavor..!! The Alabama ranch dressing had a bite to it but there are some people who love it that way...the trash ribs came with an option of extra packages of barbecue sauce they call it BESTIE sauce..Glad I ordered it...totally phenomenal sauce..  I have to admit it almost tasted like mine but that's a secret I'll take to my grave. Barbecue ribs were tender meaty and fall off the bone delicious.. If you are a true French fry fan these fries were crisp beyond measure.. All of this happiness was delivered to my front door..  Before I forget, Grubhub was very courteous...... Do yourself a favor and order from these restaurants...They are struggling due to no fault of their own...Life as we know it will be normal again, eventually and we want Salt and Smoke to be still out there making the best darn barbecue I have tasted in a long time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

French toast would be a little too sweet for me by itself, I'd suggest ordering a side or bacon or sausage to go along with it!   UPDATE: I've now not only had their brunch, but tried the drinks & appetizers also. They've got a great patio which is perfect for after work cocktails.

"Sigh..so good we had it twice while we were here! I think we achieved stage 5 clinger status with the staff lol.   Stumbled upon this restaurant because NOLA had no reservations available (see my review for NOLA separately). Entrance is on the side and through a somewhat badly lit corridor to the back. Outdoor garden seating is nice but could be bad on a rainy day with no cover.   On to the food! First time we started with the chicken liver bruschetta and the soup of the day (watermelon tomato gazpacho). Both were amazing. The chicken liver is a bit heavy (pate) so consider that if you are not too hungry and want to get dessert. I got the fish of the day which was a snapper over angel hair pasta and some sort of corn broth. Sounds a bit strange but it was seriously the best meal I had my entire stay in New Orleans. My bf got the pork shoulder which he thought was perfectly cooked and seasoned.   2nd trip there..we came on empty stomachs having only had beignets at Cafe du Monde in the morning. We got the  soup again (this time a mushroom and okra) and also got the small serving seared scallops. The soup was great, maybe a little heavy handed on the oil. Scallops were perfect..I absolutely hate when they are done wrong. It sounds a bit pricey for $16 for 2 scallops but they were enormous as was served over a bed of couscous with grapes and pine nuts (?)..so it was a fairly complex dish and worth the price. The manager sent out the chicken liver gratis (many thanks to all of the staff) probably because our previous server recognized us when we walked in. Liver was delicious as per the first trip. I got the fish of the day again, this time the drum over spinach and carrots. Well executed again but my favorite is still the snapper on the first trip. Bf got the beef cheeks this time and I thought his head would explode from the flavor. He could not stop singing his praises. We shared the panna cotta which was light and delicious. I can't believe we had 3 apps, 2 entrees, and a dessert between the two of us.   Besides the food, we also have to say the staff were great.

"I was skeptical about going to a restaurant without a website, but this place was pretty awesome. I was there on a date last night, and I'll definitely be going back.  The restaurant is nicely laid out, with lots of windows and some indoor and outdoor tables. It gives the place a very calm, French sort of an atmosphere. The service was friendly, and we weren't stuck waiting around for things. The lighting was a little bit dimmer than I would have liked after the sun went down.  The food was exceptional. The table bread is fresh-baked ciabatta rolls. The menu is quite diverse, with a wealth of dishes you just don't find at other restaurants around here.   I got a watermelon salad (watermelon, thinly-sliced red onions, and a raspberry vinaigrette), roast quail appetizer, and rabbit for the main course. Unlike some other restaurants in Santa Barbara, the prices were very reasonable. I didn't feel like I was getting gouged on the price (Stonehouse, I'm looking at you here). For this reason alone, I'll be likely to go back for seconds.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This place makes the best veggie and supreme pizzas in Philly, period.  Yes the neighborhood is a little sketchy, but I have no clue why some reviewers are down on this place.  For the last two years, this is the only place my wife and I buy pizzas from, because they make amazingly delicious pizzas (and we live in walking distance).  I used to make pizzas at home with dough from Trader Joe, but The PIzza Place puts so many great ingredients cooked to perfection on their pies, that I like their pizzas better even than my home-made pizzas!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
This is one of my favorite breakfast places. Absolutely great food and fantastic service. The menu is diverse and well thought out. It's certainly going to please the most ambitious of eaters. The fiesta burrito certainly is a party for your mouth. It is the size of a small football so be ready to go big. The stuffed French toast was probably the best French toast I have ever had. Everything on the menu will make you want to eat too much. So good.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Santa Barbara has another great neighborhood restaurant. From the time we entered the door it was a friendly, delicious experience. Hometown atmosphere with great attentive staff, busy but never rushed and definitely available for when you were ready or needed attention.

I noticed that they do have a small bar and yes they have a happy hour. Everyone very helpful and happy to take time to tell you about what they offer if you are interested.

We asked our server for recommendations, and he suggested the Pork Chop and Rare Beef Soup. My son ordered the soup and loved it -- he is kinda picky about food, so that was awesome to hear. I ordered the pork chop and it was very flavorful, excellent. We also tried the chicken congee, and after adding some accessory flavors to it, it was also good.

"This is our second dinner in three days here. This is some of the best Italian food we've enjoyed outside of Italy.   The bruschetta has a wonderful flavor of garlic mixed with the tomatoes balsamic. We had that both evenings. $2 martinis had us entertained both nights. The first evening we worked through the entire martini menu.   We ordered the pear salad one evening.  It had too much dressing but was otherwise wonderful. Get it with the dressing on the side and you won't be disappointed.    The carbonara was fantastic. Homemade sausage was amazing mixed with the cream sauce and pasta. The veal and filet were equally enjoyable.   The staff made both visits memorable. The manager, Randy, checked on us to ensure all was in order. Loura and Jason both made sure our dinners were truly memorable.   You will not be disappointed with a dinner here. We will be returning here with friends!

"Delicious!  I drove by a few times and recently decided to give them a try.  I expected them to be like most ""quick"" pizza spots; cold pizza that's reheated and tastes okay.    Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised.  They make personal 10"" pizzas from scratch.  The dough, sauce and other ingredients are made fresh daily.  I ordered the meat lovers and it was AMAZING!  I went back 3x the same week.  The quality of their pizza is great and the prices are low.  Since the dough isn't frozen, it reheats even better the next day.  They are a very welcome addition to the strip on 96th & North by Northwest.  I highly recommend you stop by.  It's a family owned shop who truly care about the quality of their food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

So 2 things up front. FRESH and ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS. This was a spur of the moment last minute adventure as we were heading in the direction of one of our usual Thai spots. We tried basics for our first visit here. My beautiful wife enjoyed the beef PHO that in my opinion was the best PHO I have ever eaten. The broth was multi dimensional and all the vegetables were super fresh. I have the seafood and chicken pad Thai it's day in court and the sweet of the tamarind was perfectly balanced with the tart acidity of the lime. An excellent pad Thai for sure. I had a Thai tea that came in a mason jar mug and was topped with whipped cream. A bit pricey at $3.50 a mug but enjoyable to drink. So we will have to come back and get deep into the curries. A PSA for all. No sushi on Sundays. An excellent experience tonight.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

We went on a whim and I was only disappointed that we'd never tried it before... The food was TO DIE FOR. We had fried zucchini to start with- then I got the lobster mac and cheese bake. Holy cow, I don't remember much else from the night because I was high off the mac and cheese. It was that good. I really can't wait to go back. I've added some photos to the storefront info. Unfortunately, I failed to get pictures of the lobster mac and zucchini before I ate it up. I guess that is a good sign :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"In town for the weekend and deciding to grab sunday brunch as a group of seven with no reservation, i was pretty sure we were going to have to resort to a regular lunch spot when we pulled up to see a line out the door of the Eggstravaganza. However, once we poked our heads in and saw it was an ordering counter situation, the line moved rapidly. The dining area is quite small, but i cAn't fault them for not havIng enough room for a spontaneous, large group. Luckily, it was a nice enough day to sit outdoors.  The service was fast and delicious! Pictured is my friend's falafel eggs benny- as i had dug into mine too quickly for a good photo. The price was of the more reasonable end for your standard brunch and the portions were liberal; my classic eggs benny+hash brown casserole was $12 and got me stuffed. I also got an iced almond milk latte which was delightful. They have a nice espresso set-up. Even though we sat outdoors and the inner dining room was packed, the friendly staff still checked in on us plenty.  I see some reviews remarking on the ordering counter format. Personally i really dig it because you get the 'ugh i'm spending money  on something unnecessary' feeling out of the way before you eat, which i feel improves a meal greatly.  My only caveat would be that they lack a hearty option for vegan eaters. I think it'd serve them well to accommodate to this growing group.  Overall, excellent brunch on many fronts, glad we didn't pass this place up.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Authentic Italian food is hard to come by in this area and La Casa Della Pasta delivered.   Every bite of food that I had was really good. The calamari to start was fantastic. It was lightly fried and had great flavor. The pieces were legit sizes and not scraps like at other places. The butter sauce served alongside it was very tasty and it was a nice offering compared to a traditional red sauce served with calamari.   The entrees were even better and full of flavor. The pasta was clearly hand made and extremely fresh. It wasn't overly heavy and the consistency of the sauce was fantastic. The portions were friendly and plated really well.   The service all around was excellent and the owners were very heavily involved and it was noticed. They made sure every order was to their liking before bringing it out to the customers.

The service was outstanding, they were so fast during lunch and so nice and friendly. I asked about things that were gluten free and they were so accommodating and let me know everything that I could have and if others could be changed so that I could eat it. While we were there they had a birthday and the servers actually looked happy to be there and you could tell they really loved what they are doing, we had great conversations with multiple servers...so great!  The food...wow.....I got the Molcajete De Pollo which is a chicken in tomato sauce served in this awesome Lavarock Bowl and it comes out all hot and bubbling. It's served with corn tortillas and the perfect small portion of guac, rice, beans. Delicious and totally recommend this dish and it also comes in beef. Everything is so fresh and authentic and they don't load your plate with the rice and beans, they load it with the stuff you really want.  The chips and salsa was amazing, 2 types of salsa, one fresh like pico and then one that is more smokey, both absolutely amazing - we had to get a refill it was so good.   The ambiance of this place is outstanding, we walked into this gorgeous room in a brownstone with massive rooms, all of the amazing details of the house preserved, white table cloths (during lunch is so classy) with beautiful place settings. I wanted to walk in every room and just look at the decor.   They also have a happy hour Mon-Fri from 2:30-6:30p with half priced apps and drinks and $4 margaritas.

"I'm going to give this place 5 stars because of how incredibly accommodation they were for our large group during brunch. We had 11 adults and one newborn, and they ensured that we all felt comfortable.   Now onto the food and drink. I have been here before with my best friend and her husband last spring for happy hour, and because the weather was so beautiful and because my friend brought her dog, we ended up sitting outside. They were really friendly then, too!   The brunch experience was the first time I had ever eaten inside. We ended up doing small bites and wine that first time, so we didn't really get a chance to eat much. We ordered rose and it was one of the bottles that the server recommended. The food here is very good. I ended up getting the biscuits and gravy for brunch, and most of us did the ""almost bottomless"" mimosas. I ordered a carafe of the ruby red, which is made with grapefruit juice, and it was very good though it did have quite a bit of pulp. Didn't bother me, but I know some people don't like pulp.   A few others ordered the eggs benedict entrees, all of which were awesome. The crab cake one was delicious! The breakfast flatbread was also very good.

"No fitting words are capable of describing a legend. However indescribable these sacraments actually are, I will attempt to relay to you the experience my GI system refers to as ""God's gifts."" My stomach went to heaven and back. This is its story.  Soft bread with a delicately crisp exterior. Marbled beef, thinly sliced, juicy, tender, delicate like an infant's skin. A wave of soft provolone cheese smothers the meat and oozes from each side of the cheesesteak, carrying gems of fried onions. Hot, crispy fries pair well with this delicacy, which cleanses the palate and fuels the addictiveness of the miracle in front of you. Don't miss out on the mozzarella sticks as well. Perfectly seasoned and cheesy.   What is the secret of perfection? In a disordered, chaotic world ruled by physical forces of which we have little control, perfection and beauty certainly are rarities. However, some geniuses have found order in our world. Euclid described the Golden Ratio. Fibonacci the Fibonacci sequence. Pythagoras the Pythagorean theorem. And last but not least, Steve's Ratio: the perfect combination of bread, meat, and cheese. Steve's Ratio may be shared and even imitated, but it will forever reside in the gastronomical caverns of my heart.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"eDESIa is truly a hidden gem in Nashville, both from a culinary and service perspective, and deserves to be one of the go-to restaurant hotspots in our city.  My wife & I ordered the fried gnocchi, eggplant parmesan, & risotto, and everything was nothing less than spectacular and insanely delicious.  Let go of any preconceived notions or skepticism you may have about the concept (a mashup of Italian & Indian flavors and cuisines) - this was one of the best meals we've had in quite some time.  On top of that, the service is top-notch - our server Regan was so warm, generous, and knowledgeable, and the owner treated us to an incredible tiramisu at the end of our dinner, completely on the house.  The kindness of the staff at eDESIa alone makes it worth coming here, and simultaneously, the food is simply superb.  A winning combination all around.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Pulled pork sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe - thats all you need to know.  One of the best sandwiches in Philly, if not number 1. I cant really put into words what it tastes like,. Its just something that you have to try for yourself. I will warn you though its very messy. Tends to get pretty soggy and the roll gives way by the time its all over but its worth it.  Bottom line; If you're confused about what to order here, please smack yourself, very hard.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"The cake is already spectacular, but what makes this place truly memorable is the beautiful decor inside and out. I didn't make a reservation in advance so had to take the cake to-go unfortunately, so make sure you do that if you want to enjoy the atmosphere inside. The cake itself was incredible (but it pretty much has to be if you charge $15 a slice) and I highly recommend the raspberry champagne flavor. The buttercream wasn't too sweet and the slight tartness from the raspberries was a really good contrast. Cake itself was also super fluffy!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"We almost didn't stop here while in New Orleans, but I'm so glad we did! It was some of the best food we had during our visit, and the customer service was great. I cannot eat a lot of food, but our server and the chef went above and beyond to accommodate me. Because they did, I was able to enjoy their Crispy Chicken Wings tossed with their yellow curry glaze. It was very good.. messy..but worth it. My husband had their Crispy Chicken Vindaloo Po-Mi and loved it. Beware, it's spicy though! We both had their unsweet tea and it was good too! Thanks so much for allowing me to eat out without having to settle without what I really wanted and providing a great dining experience. I wish we could visit more often, but this restaurant will always be a must stop when in town!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
I was craving some of LA finest raw oysters. It's a myth that you can't eat them in warm months. Pascals Manale has an awesome oyster happy hour. Be nice and tip the man who shucks them. He is also a great conversationalist. Great wait staff as well. The oysters were the size of my hand. Could have been a little saltier but you can't control Mother Nature might be the reason.

"SUPERB!  Went to 1111 for the first time tonight and had an amazing experience.  I can't remember that last time I had such a great meal, and I eat out fairly often.  The atmosphere is really cozy and warm, yet really pretty and like, Tuscan-chic (if there is such a thing).  Seriously, I would live there.  I feel like half the night, I just sat there and basked in the wonderful, glowing feel of the place.  I started with the Shrimp and Corn Bisque, which was phenomenal.  If I hadn't had dessert, I would have labeled this as the best part of my meal.  The flavor was just so rich and wonderful.  I expect to spend hours in my own kitchen, trying to recreate it.  Which means of course, I'll have to go back to 1111 several times... for research purposes, you know...  But anyway, the spicy, cream broth paired really well with the shrimp and corn - so incredible.  For my entree, I had the Potato-Encrusted Alaskan Halibut, which was also superb.  The tender halibut filet sat atop a fantastically-seasoned bed of spaghetti squash.  And underneath the squash... surprise!  LOBSTER.  Seriously... talk about the best surprise ever.  This was all surrounded by an incredible tarragon buerre blanc sauce.  The flavor of this went so perfectly with the seafood, yet it was very subtle.  My mom had the Lobster Risotto, which was also wonderful.  It was so colorful and vibrant, with capers and goat cheese on top.   The service was top-notch.  We didn't want for anything, and our server (Denny was his name) was very knowledgeable and helpful.  I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  The rest of the restaurant staff was also very courteous and helpful.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, we decided to order dessert: Creme Custard Napoleon.  OH. MY. GOD.  The flavors were so rich, yet delicate at the same time.  The carameled bananas really made this dessert, along with the tiny bits of chocolate shavings.  It was the perfect amount of flavor.  That seemed to be the theme 1111's fare.  Knowing when to bring out flavors and when to mute them.  They really know what they're doing in that kitchen.  By the end of the meal, I was practically giddy with food-induced euphoria.  I think I may have just found my new favorite restaurant.  I can't wait to go back!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"When I moved to Nashville, this was the very first place I ate. I truly think this is one of best Cafe's in Nashville, for a multitude of reasons.   For starters, the food is fantastic. The chicken salad is up there in best chicken salads I've ever had. The actual salads are gigantic and filling, the BBQ sandwich is perfect and the chicken fingers go great with the honey mustard.   The price is also fantastic. Having ate here daily for months at a time, it was great to be able to get such delicious food at an honest price.   But more than anything, what makes this little Nashville cafe great is the people who run it. They are kind, always smiling, remember your name and genuinely look excited to be at work. You can tell that they love what they are doing and it makes the whole place that much more special.   Highly suggest Maggie's for their bacon, egg and cheese biscuit with a hash brown, a scoop of chicken salad with the club crackers or a salad with grilled chicken. You won't be disappointed.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Pho 75 is, hands down, the best place to get pho on Washington Ave. Their menu is simple- pho is the only option here (no summer rolls, broken rice, bun bo hue, etc.), but they do it exceptionally well. (Sidenote: my personal pet peeve is when pho places have shrimp pho as an option on their menu. That is not a thing! Luckily, you won't find it here.) I always get pho with pretty much all the meats, tendon, and tripe. My non Vietnamese husband loves his pho with eye round steak, brisket, and meatballs. Their brisket in particular is always less fatty than other pho places around here.    Thank goodness they're still open for takeout during COVID. It takes less than 5 mins for you to order and for them to pack up the food. I would suggest keeping the noodles separate or else they will clump together by the time you get home. It's also still cash only. Prices are a bit higher now but the pho is so worth it. Anything to keep our favorite pho place open!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

First, and perhaps most importantly, the beers are excellent. They specialize in barrel aged beers, especially sours, and they know what they are doing and they do it extremely well.  Their IPAs were fantastic too.  Planning for the event was a breeze, the owner was very responsive and helpful and when we arrived he was friendly and accommodating.

One of the days we decided to pick up a quick lunch to bring down to the beach (which was a terrible idea in hindsight because of the seagulls!) Anyway, we stopped into this McDonalds and we were blown away by the amazing customer service! A guy named AJ was working at the register and in the time I was there I witnessed him dealing with 2 different difficult customers and through the entire process he was professional and courteous. There was also a girl helping to man the front end (I didn't catch her name but she had really pretty feather earrings) who was exceptionally cheery and helpful.

"I can't believe I'm going to say this...here's a CHAIN restaurant that is a welcome addition to the Indy restaurant scene.  It's located at 96th and Meridian, and at rush hours it can be a challenge to get to due to traffic, so they've got to be at the top of their game for folks to fight that traffic, and they certainly are doing that!  We've been there a couple of times, and both times, they experience has been stellar, from the hostess to the server to the meal to the dessert.  I'm a huge fan of the Durango burger, one of their signature burgers, and an even bigger fan of the fact that they know how to cook a burger to order...something sadly lacking all too often today.  Price run to the upper side of moderate to the lower side of expensive, so it's not a place we'll eat every week.  That said...when we want to splurge a bit, or for a special occasion, Firebirds is at the top of our list.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I called EdgeWild to modify my order shortly after placing it online, but learned their kitchen closed 5-10 minutes earlier despite what Yelp said. Despite this, Cory made it happen.

"I assume most people will discover this place when their craving for the infamous breakfast sandwich strikes. It's infamous for a reason and it was just as good as at the farmers market. We ordered curbside online- the process was easy and so was pick up. Aside from the the combo(the famous one) we also got one with just cheese. Both were great and you can add their amazing honey at no extra cost. The grilled cheese made me wish they had a tomato bisque or some dip-able soup on the menu. We also ordered the mushroom and kale frittata. It was delicious! If you love mushrooms this is the choice. It's stuffed with tasty ozark mushrooms and has a nice cheesy favor without being too heavy. The salad on the side was tasty but I wish it was separate from the hot frittata- I'm just not one for warm greens, even slightly warm. It's curbside only right now but the food is excellent. These restauranteurs know great food and I'm so excited for more items from Songbird. Also just a heads up that this menu is very gluten free and vegetarian friendly!

"I was looking for a good Italian restaurant for a get together with my best friend and our mutual friends who are going out of town for a month. As one member is vegetarian, we needed variety. I found Taormina's via Yelp reviews and after 4 really good suggestions, I thought what the heck!  To look at it from the outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much. Very low key, maybe 2 dozen tables but our waitress was super friendly and offered great suggestions. One of the best was the vodka sauce. Perhaps the BEST I've ever had. I wound up selecting the baked stuffed shells. Usually when you get stuffed shells, they throw them in a metal dish, over cook them in the pizza oven and the tops are burnt. Here, the tops weren't burnt and the shells were cooked but not crispy. I was able to get it with the vodka sauce. Out. Of. This. WORLD! With a side of sausage, Caesar salad and garlic bread, my cost was $12.50. So much food for super reasonable !!! My best friend had the gnocchi with chick and vodka sauce which was amazing and the chicken and rice soup which tasted home made. Our friends had the tortellini which was amazing!

The ambiance, the setting(fire pits got me), the friendliness from the staff, the servers are one of a kind and kitchen of course made some amazing food.  I especially loved their Hummus, cheese roll, Tabuleh, the beef & chicken skewers. (although I like the chicken better).  The garlic sauce that went with the skewers was sooo yummy (must try!). They had a full bar and I ordered a Moscow Mule it was delicious!  We had a large party of 42.  They had a set menu which always works out better for a large group.  We had 20 kids in the group and we did not have a single complaint about the kids. The kids and adults had a very good time.  It is always hard to find a place to accommodate everyone's expectations.     They had great Arabic music (they even let us play a little bit of our own music).  they also had a belly dancer.

The food was fantastic -- I want to mention specifically the Chiang Mei noodle dish, and the Golden Triangles, YUM! -- so good, in fact, that we ordered from them again just a few days later. This second order was also via DoorDash. When it arrived, we were missing one entire entree, which was a huge bummer (and truthfully, I suspect DoorDash has some issues with transmitting orders, because this is not the first restaurant with which we've had this exact thing happen!). I called up the restaurant to ask about it, even though I know you really should make those complaints through DoorDash, as they are the entity that has to resolve it and refund your money. Well...Baan Thai apologized, then they went ahead and cooked up the entree right away, and the owner DROVE IT OVER TO OUR HOUSE PERSONALLY, with a free Thai iced coffee thrown in for good measure! To me, that speaks volumes about the kind of businesspeople -- and really just the kind of human beings! -- they are.

The website did not show the seasonal items on the menu, so the choices were more varied that we expected.   We opened the meal with parsnip soup and the New Orleans Barbeque Lobster.  Both were layered with unexpected flavors.  The parsnip soup was creamy and rich, but not overwhelmingly so.  The richness was cut with a citrus flavor that made it very refreshing rather than heavy.   The BBQ Lobster was worth every cent!  The lobster came plated over a  a generous sized baguette slice resting on a plate of flavorful sauce with a lemon confit.   The bread soaked in the sauce was addictive! I'm often skeptical of lobster dishes since it can be overcooked and tough.  The lobster that topped the bread, however, was supple and sweet.  The lemon confit was an excellent complement to the dish.    For the main course, I can highly recommend the pan seared scallops with curry emulsion.  The crust on the scallops was impressive --a thick golden brown crispy sear topped the perfectly cooked scallops.  The portion is not large, but I found it to be a filling dish.  My dinner companions had the smoked pepper dusted tuna (recommended by the waitperson), and the sweet potato pappardelle.  Both raved about the quality of their dishes.    The final delight of the evening was the deconstructed root beer float.  The ""float"" arrives on a plate as a slice of rich ice cream topped by a ginger/chocolate cookie and an egg-shaped root beer sorbet.  By taking a bite of each piece of the dish together, it combines into a delicious float in your mouth.  The presentation was whimsical and the flavors were spot-on.    We highly recommend this -- the pictures of the dining room on the web do not do it justice.  The low lights in the evening make this a soothing, intimate dining experience.   This is slightly off the beaten path since is on the opposite side of Canal from the Quarter, but it is only a couple of blocks away in a good neighborhood.  It is well worth the short walk.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
I have been to tons of olive gardens but this one wins the award of the best one I've ever been to. The food was 3x better than I thought it would be and the breadsticks were insane.

"We love, love, love Taffy's! We've had almost everything on the menu and have enjoyed every bite. There's no doubt about it that Taffy's is our favorite pizza in town, but we also love the great beer selection, bread sticks, salads, pastas and sandwiches.   They have a HUGE selection of pizza breads, veggies toppings, cheeses and meats. Because they have such a variety of toppings, their sandwiches, salads, etc. have a great selection of toppings too. I called and accidentally asked to order an antipasto salad, not realizing that they don't even have an antipasto salad on the menu. However, they have such amazing customer service, that they assured me they have everything to make a great antipasto salad delivered to my house. And they were right!! It was incredible.   AND free delivery, but call early to place your order. It can take a little while depending on when you call. So worth it for free delivery!!   Pre-Covid times, they offered fun events like trivia on their large, private outdoor patio. I hope they can start that up again soon.   They also have a small arcade room and lots of children's books scattered here and there for the kiddos. Very family friendly!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Since my first bite, Parkway has implanted itself upon my appetite, and taken over like a ravenous vine.  I have what some would call, The Hunger.  Once you get a bite of that delicious, delicious Parkway Poboy, you can never get it out of your head.  Nothing can satisfy the hunger except for more Parkway.    You'll find yourself sitting in your favorite Fine Dining establishment, and the service will be good and the food will be good, but in the back of your mind, you'll be thinking, I could have gotten a parkway poboy for every day of the week for what I just spent; and I would have been much more happy with it, too.  Here's the bottom line: Parkway is as good as everyone says, maybe better because they have so many different poboys.  There is, without a doubt in my mind, a poboy for everybody.  The value of a regular poboy is great, and the large poboys, undeniable.  They know how good their food is, and yet they're completely unpretentious and laid back.  Get a drink if you want, sit outside if you want, take the poboy to go and eat it at your leisure.  It's just a darn good product without any baggage and rules like what you find in a Restaurant.  In fact, eating at Parkway is more like eating at a friend's house.  New Orleans needs it's high-brow, fine dining restaurants, don't get me wrong.  But it also needs its low-brow, no BS, just-good-food places, to keep everyone in check, and Parkway is the epitome of that.  The best food, and lots of it, for cheap!  Be warned, if you go, you will begin to measure all other restaurants against what you could have gotten at Parkway.    God rests on Tuesdays.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

The highlight, though, was our dessert: a Nutella crepe with bananas and Bailey's ice cream. It's more than worth the $1.50 to add the ice cream! Our waitress was very nice and the perfect mix of attentive and unobtrusive. She even lowered the fan speed when we mentioned we were freezing.

"This is a tough review because as I'm checking the website to recall what I ate I'm absolutely starving for more of Buddakan. It is near impossible for me not to get in my car, pay the bridge toll, sit in traffic and order everything all over again.   Let's start with this, if I had to choose between all the Starr restaurants I've been to Buddakan is the best. El Vez -least favorite because it wasn't my style food. Stella Pizza- I had a great pizza that was a special that day..will go back. The Continental - an addiction, almost as amazing as Buddakan.  It was my boyfriend's birthday and as I requested on my online reservation we have a private seating and our table is available early. Perfect. Inside there is the giant Buddah staring at us and he is just so effin brilliant looking. Our chairs had faces on them, one of which was one of my boyfriend's favorite musicians. Score.  The menu was not overwhelming and because I checked this site beforehand I had an idea of what I could suggest to him. We ordered: Appetizers-- EDAMAME RAVIOLI + KOBE BEEF SATAY; Entree-- GRILLED LAMB CHOPS and Side-- WASABI MASHED POTATOES. He ordered a beer and I ordered a WHITE PEACH-GINGER ZEN-GRIA. The server mentioned that we may still be hungry and this wasn't enough; he was wrong, it was the perfect portion.  Before the food, my Zen-gria was $9 and since I'm a tequila girl it was a great change-up. First came the Edamame Ravioli (3 or 4) and the sauce wasn't too heavy. The edamame was a unique but fantastic combination. Next, the Kobe and that was even better and a little larger portion. The veggies had pine nuts which is what really kept the veggies tasty. The beef was cooked perfectly and the dish was my favorite. Finally, the lamb chops and wasabi potatoes arrived and was also crazy good. This was possibly the 5th time I've tried lamb and I'm certainly a fan of how this lamb was served. The wasabi potatoes are distinctive in taste and because it is an odd paring you want to keep eating them. I had leftovers and reheated weren't so good though.   We skipped dessert but since it was my boyfriend's birthday they came out with a sparkler and a brownie type of dessert (aw, sweet!). We split some of it and it was the perfect portion...heavy and we couldn't finish it.   Overall I was very happy with Buddakan but I'll only go here for a special occasion or to impress someone (out of towner or a boss). If I ate there too often I think I'd get bored quickly.   For the frugal: My bill was $113 and included tip so this place may not be for money-pinchers.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Went here for the first time about 2 weeks ago.  I had read a lot of positive articles about Paesano's, and it seems to always make the top 5 sandwich shops on people's lists, so damn, I had to check this place out.  After finishing up some shopping outside at the Italian Market, the wife and I dipped inside, and as soon as I walked in I knew this place was going to be good.  A couple of guys at the hightop counters were hunched over their sandwiches with looks of ecstacy on their faces.  No talking at all, just nom-nom-noming away.          Well, we ordered a couple sandwiches from a very amiable counter dude, and decided on plate of potatoes to share.  I had the porkette sandwich which goes by another name which I forget, and my wife had a brisket sandwich.  Can I say this is the best porkette I've ever had?  Yes, oh hell yes, I can.  Now listen, I regard the porkette sandwich as the real philadelphia sanwich, as everyone knows about cheesesteaks.  The combo of ingredients does it for me.  The pork was outrageously tender with great flavor, and the cooked down peppers, rabe, and sharp prov did that sandwich right.  My wife's brisket sandwich was more up her alley.  I tried one bite, but that bite just interupted the super happy fun porkette time in my mouth.  The potatoes were nuclear hot, but once they cooled down I really enjoyed them.  Think highly seasoned oven cooked home fries.  God, I can'[t stop thinking about that sandwich....Porkette, people.  Pork-ette.

"I absolutely love Rickshaw's. A friend brought me here about four years ago to try sushi and I have been hooked ever since. Their prices are reasonable and the food is divine. They have a great selection of appetizers that are covered under the All You Can Eat menu. Other places have too much rice and too little fish. Rickshaw's balances the fish to rice ratio perfectly.   They have a wonderful variety of rolls to choose from. Though, I have to say that the Rickshaw II is my favorite. Each time I go, I order at least two Rickshaw II rolls.   I have several friends who go with me when I want sushi, but they are not seafood fans. Both will order teriyaki chicken or other dishes that aren't sushi. They both claim that their teriyaki chicken is the best.   The sushi chefs are very personal, so I highly recommend sitting at the bar. One afternoon, I was talking to several of them about the different sushi restaurants around town. They told me that several of their friends work at other well known places in Reno, but all of them come to Rickshaw's if they want sushi. That is something to ponder. :)   The only thing I will caution you on is the wait time. Normally, they take a long time to serve you and bring you the bill. A meal at Rickshaw's can be an hour and a half to two hours. I am a patient person and the food is so good that I don't mind. I couldn't bare to take a star away for that.   Unfortunately, I have now moved to Florida for my husband's job. We live in the Pensacola area not too far from the ocean. I have tried several sushi places, but none compare to Rickshaw's!

"We love this place - very down-home Italian, unpretentious, excellent food, AND very reasonably priced (read: this is not your Center City pricing). BYOB. A favorite for us is the Mushroom Ravioli, or try the Fettucine Moma - note the house-made pasta, too, a really nice aspect of dining here. Interesting specials change frequently. Brussels Sprouts side dish, very good. Everything fresh - thus an excellent arugula salad.  I suggest reservations, as the place is fairly small, and it does fill up, even on weekdays. A stone's throw from the Quintessence Theater on Germantown Avenue.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Memo's is quite possibly the best Mexican restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. Memo's cooking is, for lack of a better word, phenomenal. There's sometimes a wait (20 minutes at most) but if you expected to be seated immediately you might as well go to McDonald's. And for being short staffed, everyone there works their butts off to get you your food quickly and I'd honestly gladly wait an hour just to get the chance to eat some of their quesobirria.  I've seen some comments about them now charging to chips and salsa after your first batch, but it's a negligible cost on your part and if you order an appetizer, you get more at no extra cost. Plus your food is normally out to you before you're even done with your chips.   The bar may be closed, but that does not slow them down in getting your drinks to you. AND THEY ARE DELICIOUS. Try their best darn margarita and you will not be disappointed.   If anyone of the staff see this, know that your hard work and dedication does not go unnoticed. You all do a phenomenal job and work harder than any other restaurant I've ate at.   10/10 will be back again and again!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

My hubby had the fried butterflied shrimp, and said they were as great as they always are! We met up with some friends who had the crab cake, and the fried flounder platter. Both loved!

I had both the Heart Attack and the Bananas Foster waffles. Most everything was cheap enough you could do that if you wanted, or try their sampler of their most popular waffles. There's also pancakes, crepes, omelettes, and assorted sides, and there are selection options for gluten-free and kosher diets. The staff was friendly and engaging as well.

"So here's the scoop, I've walked by this place a million times to go to a movie and it was just never convenient to go try. Boyfriend got a living social so we went after a movie, on a Saturday but the deal was for during the week only (missed that fine print) but we were there, we were hungry. When trying new pizza places I always just go for a pepperoni. To me you an tell a place by that pie alone.  The pizza comes out, delicious bubbly goodness. Right amount of cheese. Sauce is AMAZINGLY perfect. You can taste the tomato without it being acidic or overpowering. The pepperoni is flavorful and in plenty. Now the crust....key to a good pizza...it's thin...it's crisp in all the right places and that yummy yeasty doughy flavor on the inside.   How have I never been in here before! I'm kicking myself in the ass for all the great pizza I've missed.  My ONLY request.....they open a location in the Northwest. We have nothing but chains up here and although we'll make a drive for good pizza (grimaldis, pieface) it would be great to have a ""mom and pop"" joint up here that takes such great pride in their pizza.

"So I haven't written in quite a long time but coming to Dante's Kitchen has inspired me to tell the world just how truly AMAZING it is.   My friends and I went to NOLA for Jazz fest and we decided to try several of the top spots to eat (as we were all foodies) including some of the most famous and luxurious spots NOLA has to offer. I can honestly say our meal at Dante's Kitchen was hands down the most memorable. To me that's how I know when a restaurant is special: When it perfectly sears a culinary memory into my head. Dante's Kitchen did just that...  So the 5 of us came here for Brunch. As someone who has enjoyed some fantastic brunches in my life, I can't tell you how remarkable it is when I say it's in the top 3 brunches of my life. One quick piece of advice: It opens up for Brunch at 10:30 a.m. Make sure to get there no later than 10:10 because there was already a line down the street waiting for the doors to open when we arrived at 10:15. Oh and they only serve brunch on Saturdays and Sundays.  Now onto the brunch... We all started out with freshly squeezed OJ which was delicious as well as some of their house coffee. I'm not a coffee drinker but was told by my brunch mate it was fantastic. Next we decided to start out with some of their famous biscuits and a mixed breakfast bread basket. The mixed bread basket was great but Ooooooohhhhh the biscuits... Seriously... if they make biscuits in heaven, they use this recipe. They were warm and flaky, buttery and delicious just as it. They were hearty but light at the same time if that makes any sense. Not only were they great on their own but they even served them with some fresh house made jams and hand churned butter. The strawberry jam and butter together in one bite of biscuit was like tasting happiness. So GET THE BISCUITS when you go.  Now onto the meal...  Eggs Benedict is hands down my favorite breakfast meal and I use it to gauge most restaurants I go to. And Dante's Did not disappoint. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and runny when cutting into them mixing the delicious yoke with the hollandaise (which kicked some serious brunch ass). Underneath the eggs was a rosemary rubbed pork loin, juicy and tender served on top of a biscuit with honey (that's right the same ones from before). I can tell you that the combination of the hollandaise, pork, honey, and biscuit hit every sense and taste bud with a symphony of savory, and a hint of sweet with the perfect layer of textures. Seriously, this eggs benny was awesome.  My partners in dine also had the ""Debris and Poached Eggs"" (poached eggs on biscuits with hollandaise on a bed of pulled pork), bread pudding french toast (with a seasonal fruit sauce and powered sugar) all of which were fantastic.   But the true star of the brunch was ""The Special"". This was a their seasonal eggs benny. Poached eggs on top of their ridiculously good biscuits but this time served on top of a perfectly cooked, flaky blackened  flounder on a bed of blue cheese and bacon grits all covered by a crawfish hollandaise. I would never have considered that much seafood for brunch but I can tell you this: we each had a bite at the table, and each one of us took turns, slowly closing our eyes, savoring the delicious mouthful, and getting our brains seared with that beautiful life altering memory of a bite that none of us will ever forget. The only sad part is that the special will probably not be there again. But paraphrasing a quote from Red from the movie Shawshank Redemption: ""Sometimes it makes me sad, though... *The Special* being gone. I have to remind myself that some Specials aren't meant to be put on a menu. Their flavors are just too good. And when they go away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to keep them around DOES rejoice. But still, the meals you eat are that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss that special...""  If you go to NOLA. Do yourself a favor. Grab some brunch at Dante's Kitchen. And before you enter their doors close your eyes and tell yourselves this: ""Time to make a memory"".",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Dim Sum House absolutely killed it. At 10 pm on a Sunday, we weren't expecting to find much but this place hit the spot. We got there for the ""Late Night"" menu, which surprisingly had a lot to offer. The dishes we chose were the Pork Soup Dumplings, Curry Chicken Dumplings, Shrimp Sui Mai, and Dan Dan noodles. Even late at night, everything was absolutely delicious. They're really bringing their A game to the food scene on this side of the city.  The restaurant seems pretty modern and nicely laid out. It even has a pool table! The bar seemed to be lacking in beer options but they seemed to offer a decent wine and cocktail menu. The food was moderately priced compared to similar Chinatown restaurant but it definitely speaks to the quality.   With the quality of their late night menu, I'm excited to come back and try their dinner menu.  The fact that they're open late and serving A+ food is a huge plus for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"On the Edge of Glory.  Whether you crave a delicious specialty pizza or one of the most gourmet salads this place has landed on the map with a giant WHAMMIE!  I will be reviewing the Arugula Salad (Grilled Baby Shrimp, Asparagus, Eggplant & Zucchini with Fresh Mozzarella Topped with Lump Crabmeat and Balsamic).  This salad has all off the vegetables char-grilled. It really makes the salad come alive with a smokiness only accelerated by the bitter Arugula....this meshes well with the ample seafood they put over the bed of arugula. The shrimp are small but good and the most expensive item the crabmeat they give you a nice amount-  which for 13.95 I am happy they give you the right amount. So if you are in the mood for not your typical salad treat yourself to this item (you must be a lover of char-grilled vegetables and arugula of course)  I have had the pizzas before here as well and they are good and also different then your normal corner store pizza shop. Highly recommend you try this place if you are in the area!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"One of the best, if not the best steaks i've ever had. I had the dry aged ribeye which comes with a trio of sauces. I almost NEVER use steak sauce with my steaks. I think a well prepared steak will be delicious with just salt and pepper. But Emeril makes a worchestershire sauce that's OUT OF THIS WORLD. I found myself dipping my steak in there over and over again. The recipe can be found online, but I'd rather just have it when I'm here. Service is good, restaurant has an old upscale vibe going. Only thing I didn't like was the pork cheek, but then again, I've ordered it from 3 other restaurants, and never liked a single one.

"This place is LEGIT!  My wife and I loved it.  The service was outstanding and the food was wonderful.  Doylestown has a gem in Melograno.  Melograno is located in a shopping center, which made me wonder about my decision, but the food and service quickly made me forget about the location.  The owners are Italian, and the fact that I had trouble understanding the specials b/c of the thick Italian accent of the owner, let me know that I was in the right spot.  We started with the Calamari Fritti, and it was pretty good.  Definitely not the best calamari I have had, but it was decent.  They have a very comprehensive wine list for wine connoisseurs.     We next got the Insalata Mista, which was a great starter salad.  I saw the Insalata Mista con Gorgonzola at another table, and it looked really good if you like gorgonzola.  For our entrees, my wife got the Lobster Ravioli, and I got the Lobster Spaghetti with spicy marinara sauce.  Both of these meals were very, very good.  It is lobster season, and Melograno does it right.  We decided to try the desserts since no one else has Yelped Melograno, and Yelpers need the full report, from start to finish.  The Napoleon was outstanding.  The Cannoli was very good as well, but not as good as the Napoleon. The presentation of the desserts let you know this place is a winner.  If you are in Doylestown, definitely try Ristorante II Melograno.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I can now tell you, with confidence, that the food is superb, the service attentive without being annoyingly so, and the atmosphere warmly casual.   My husband-the-foodie raved about the whole fish.   My daughter and I loved the grilled yellow-fin tuna special, over a faro salad of al dente barley, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, and new greens, all coated in a lovely basil pesto.   The art on the walls adds to the New Orleans feel, without being intrusive.   This is one of New Orleans unknown gems. Try it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Five star for a diner.  I eat at the Whitman about once a week, and am never disappointed.  Great service, fresh and well prepared food, and better than diner atmosphere.    Its hard to give a diner five stars but the Whitman has earned it.  Never thought much about the Whitman, just a run of the mill diner.  Over the last couple of years, they have transformed into a diner with class and quality food.  Breakfast for me is usually eggs benedict which are always fresh and has a great taste.  The sauce always taste fresh and not out of a can.  The home fries are red skin potatoes that are also fresh and well seasoned, not left over refried from the night before.  For lunch, the turkey club is awesome.  Plenty of fresh cooked turkey, cheese and bacon on multigrain bread.  I am not much of a liverwurst person, but for some reason when I go there for lunch I have a hankering for their liverwurst and onion sandwich on rye with swiss.  Again, above quality products.  Soups are always fresh and for instance, the chicken soup has plenty of chicken and is not 100% noodles like most restaurants/diners.    Its hard to rate a diner five stars, but they have definitely earned it.  Prices are slightly high, but for the quality and quantity of food it is worth the extra dollar or two per meal.  Diner is clean and well kept.  Service is also great and staff is attenitive.  At times hard to get into espcecially weekend mornings, so call ahead.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"We used Rincon Catering for our wedding dinner. We got married on the beach and decided to hold our dinner on the patio of our rental house. It was a very small affair (about 30 people) and there was a very nice rustic charm to it. Rincon catered our food and it was incredible!! Everyone kept going on about how delicious it was-for good reason! We couldn't be happier with their service and quality!  We had also looked into getting married at Rincon Beach Club and it was a reasonable price for the packages they put together.

"Going in you should know: MK does not yet have a liquor license (working on it), decor is very simple, and the menu is atypical in that you build your own entree; I could see where some of this could be off putting to the typical consumer.  None of this detracts from one fact: The food is AMAZING. Period.  MK operated a food truck for many years, and he grew up cooking with his mother, creating food for monks in his homeland. Preparing great food has been his life long passion, and he has perfected this craft.  He is a generous, honest, and talented individual and operates the kind of small business you feel proud supporting. My boyfriend is one of the pickiest eaters on the planet. The concept of choosing exactly what he wanted in his Pad-Thai--he LOVED it! I'm more of an ""order an elaborate dish off the menu"" kind of girl, and honestly I ordered only an appetizer my first visit there. Then proceeded to eat most of my boyfriend's food because it was so lovely and aromatic when it arrived, I could NOT stop eating it!! Obviously, we've been back and I am now loving the concept of building my own dish, MK style!  Just ate leftovers for lunch today and typically I throw away or don't even bother with boxing things, at all. I wouldn't want to waste one bite of MK's food though!  Go here!!

"As I told our server, ""like dining in Paris without the ten-hour flight.""  We could find absolutely no fault with our whole experience.    For starters, the service was excellent.  There is nothing more that needs to be said about that.    First course: Salmon tartare--authentic, fresh and delicious.  Mushrooms in cream sauce with puff pastry--to die for.  Delicious, rich, flavorful.  House-made baguette: about as good as you can get stateside for this sort of thing.  Bibb salad--fresh, flavorful, a little too heavy on the dressing, but we forgave since it tasted so wonderful.  Main courses: Rabbit--very good.  Homemade tagliatelle were a nice touch.  Tender and flavorful.  Chicken--exceptional.  Sauce made with Macvin du Jura was out of this world.  Morel mushrooms pushed it over the edge.  Chicken was juicy, delectable.    Dessert: Gateau Opera was extra rich and decadent.  Intense chocolate flavor.  Mille feulle  aux framboises was delicious, but what really set it off was the quality of the whipped cream--extra rich and delicious.  We finished off the evening with Calvados.  They also have a nice selection of Armagnac and Cognac, so your digestif needs will be thoroughly attended to.

"OMG, I can't believe I have lived in this part of Tampa for almost two decades and I am just now discovering this gem of a restaurant. I am somewhat ashamed it took me this long to find it; but so glad I finally did. I am of the belief that the best steaks in Tampa come from Bern's or my husband's grill. But, now I am adding this restaurant to create an elite three that are worthy of my highest praise. The steak was a perfectly seasoned, melt in your mouth, (medium rare of course) marvel. It was too large for me to eat in one meal, so I enjoyed it a second time for lunch the next day. The French onion soup was phenomenal, too. The salad came with a delicious house dressing, but far too much Parmesan piled on top. I definitely recommend asking them to hold the Parmesan or serve it on the side.

He is always in the restaurant interacting with customers and makes it a point to speak with everyone who comes through the doors, making you feel as if you are family.  The egg drop soup is the best I've ever had.  It contains diced tomatoes cooked in the soup, which I think is ingenious and really gives the soup a great flavor.  I've never had any food I didn't like at China Garden.  I appreciate their dinner specials, as it is nice to get a little more with your dinner (such as soup and an egg roll) than just the entree.

"You're a man. You like meat. You understand the importance of a well marbled cut of meat and anything above medium is just offensive to you. Butcher and Singer will appeal to your inner Mad Men fantasies minus Don Draper's shady past.  The dining room is dimly lit from the massive brass chandelier hanging from the impossibly high ceilings. There is a bar to the right of the entrance lined with candles and a small but impressive liquor selection. The dining room is lined with rows of tufted banquettes on two floors with tables and very comfortable chairs well spaced in between. A giant gold bullhead is mounted on a focal wall in the back of the dining room pulling together the traditional elegant steakhouse concept.  It's a bold statement but you can't go wrong with anything you order here but I will share some personal favorites. The wedge salad is one of the best I have ever eaten. The shrimp cocktail is enormous and fresh. Oh, if you like French Onion soup get it here, but break the top and give it a few minutes to release some steam. Your tongue will thank you for it.  Obviously it's all about the steak here. The filet is a very good safe bet but I would recommend the Delmonico. The Butcher Delmonico done medium rare is one of the finest steaks I would dare to say in the Mid-Atlantic. Sides are served separately so you will have to order them if you wanted something to go along with the meat. The hash brown is enormous and easy to share but do not skip on the Brussels sprouts. Your mom would blush for have ever served them any way other than Butcher prepares them. If you don't think you like them think again.  If you somehow have room for dessert go for the Baked Alaska. It's a rare dessert to find these days only due to how much goes into the production. It's a fun balance of warm and cold with varying flavors and textures. I have sampled all of the desserts over the years I have dined here and can confidently say they're worth saving room for.  Go to Butcher with clients you want to impress, to treat yourself for being an awesome person, to prove to your parents you're a grown up, to ask your lady friend a life changing question, the list goes on. Enjoy the impeccable customer service and a meal that makes you feel like you're a bigshot on Madison Ave in the 50's.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This is the third time I have been here and I have been wowed every single time.   I hate it when I order a bao bun and it only comes it's one flimsy measly slice of meat.  This is not the case here, the meat portions are generous in the baos. The pork bao buns are brimming with both meat and flavor.   There is no better poke in this city. Whether you go with tuna or salmon you cannot go wrong. The ingredients are fresh and fit for a king.   The noodles here are really good. I have gotten eel over noodles and pork over noodles. So good. I probably wouldn't eat raw fish over noodles but any other cooked meat over noodles is sure to be a smash hit. It's worth the extra $2 for the noodles. Trust me! It is always fun to mix a soft poached egg into the meal. It makes everything so gooey and warm. I love it!  I love the melon soda here.

Fantastic atmosphere and decor at the living room. Went for dinner in a Sunday night w some friends and can defiantly see this as a place to take a date. The band up front was a bit loud but if you sit in the back you'll have no issues with noise. It's tapas styled but the meals don't leave you starving. I had the the crab cake corn dogs and they were amazing. My friends and I talked about how everything we had was both presented well and flavorful. They also have a cherry mule which was a nice alternative to the traditional Moscow. Definitely going back.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"First time back after it had originally been Flying Fish. Was visiting my sister and we had tickets to the Bill and Hillary Clinton event at the Met and figured we would head here for dinner.  Great place, great ambiance. There were pool tables and couches and a bar on the lower level near the hostess stand. We were seated upstairs in the larger area. It was packed, lots of people there watching the Sixers game and the Masters. Typical for what you would expect for a Saturday night 5:00. We were promptly greeted, our drink orders were taken, and we were given our food. Total time there was about an hour 15 mins.  Good beer selection. Also they have wines on draft which I did not try this time but plan to on my next visit. We ordered the mild wings, tots with bacon, and we split the cheesesteak. The wings were decent. Well sauced and well seasoned. The tots with bacon: life changing. The bacon was perfectly crisp, the cheese was melted and the chipotle aioli added a smoky flavor. I would eat these all day every day. The cheesesteak was uniquely flavored with a teriyaki kind of taste. There were caramelized onions and some mushrooms which added a bit of extra yummy-ness to the steak. I would have preferred a bit more cheese to have been mixed through the steak, but there is always room for improvement.  I immediately messaged my friend from Fishtown about this place and told her it is an absolute yes, that she needs to try it out. My mouth is literally watering as I write all of this thinking about the tots.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

Portions were generous (and I'm a big eater)! The employees were so nice, talkative, informative and just friendly ...for all I know, they may be the owners. If not, They all deserve a raise .

"I've been coming here since 1989.  I grew up nearby.  I only realized that I had it so good with pizza once I started trying pizza from different regions like Chicago (deep dish), San Francisco, NYC, London UK, Italy & back home in Florida.  The best Neapolitan pizza in South Jersey.  Three locations now.  Probably the best in Delaware Valley (for you out of towners...the Philly Metro).   My fave is a sausage pie.  The sausage is shaved and not crumbled.  The pizza comes out of the oven in about ten minutes.  It's piping hot, crispy and chewy.  Its also not to thin nor too thick...its just right.  It also has the perfect ratio of crust, sauce, cheese & toppings.  They don't offer as many toppings as other less worthy pizzerias but they have enough to cover the basics.  The only pizza that I've had better is from L'antica Pizzeria Da Michele in Naples Italy...the creator of Neapolitan pizza.  And that's an unfair comparison because in Italy they use buffalo mozzarella and San Marzano tomatoes.  So that just shows you how high I rank King of Pizza in Cherry Hill. So if you see the sign you gotta grab at least a slice.  Thats how I started out as a kid...with a blazing hot slice out of the oven.  Its cash only.  Wings, fried shrimp and cheese steaks aren't bad either.  Enjoy!!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Fresh, quality, delicious is what comes to mind when eating here.  We were hungry so we ordered both ramen and a little bit of sushi. The char-shu ramen was very good. It's more Asian rather than authentic Japanese, but who says ramen was a Japanese exclusive? The broth is clean and deep in flavor. I was nervous that the charshu would dominate the ramen but I'm happy to say it's super tender and balanced in flavor to let the flavor ramen broth to shine. The noodles were perfectly cooked and just right in quantity for the dish.   The sushi was next level fresh from what is available here in Boise. You can really taste the quality of the fish. The rolls wasn't overly sauced like other places, again, well balanced, fresh.   The service was stellar. The server was super nice and attentive.   My exposure to the place is limited to two visits but so far, this place has become my favorite in the valley.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"This place is like a time machine!   During a girls night out we opted to make this our destination, and having never been before I had no idea what to expect. But as soon as I walked in I knew I was going to love it. The atmosphere transforms you into feeling like you are in a genuine speakeasy. It was incredibly crowded, and I've heard that most nights they turn people away due to being at max capacity. The crowd was a bit frustrating at first, but it provided a great opportunity to make new friends... which is exactly what we did!  Now, let's get to the important part... the famous craft cocktails. I was told to order their Champagne Cocktail, and I'm always one to listen to recommendations. It was far more pricey than what I typically am willing to spend on drinks ($11), and I was even more disappointed when they brought it out because it was served in a rather small glass. I figured I would give it a try, and then switch to my usual gin and tonic. Well, needless to say I didn't have a gin and tonic the entire evening. The Champagne Cocktail was not only delicious, but also packed a big punch for the price.   I will make this a stop anytime I'm on Mass Ave, because of the laid back atmosphere and cool crowd... and because those Champagne Cocktails were absolutely to die for!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I'm by no means on a keto diet but I accompanied my sister who made a pilgrimage here in hopes of some sweet indulgence. Since I waited in line I figured I mine as well try something, and much to my surprise it was delicious! The selection is really nice and plentiful. There are rolls and loaves of bread in addition to all the sweets. They even have little birthday cakes. My sister got ""fat bombs"" which was a little alarming but apparently this is a keto thing, and she said they were great. I got the little individual Mexican hot chocolate cheesecake which was phenomenal! I'm not sure what kind of black magic is going on back there to make these things so sweet and delicious but it is working! While the prices are a little steep they do have a buy five get one free special on all their items.  Another cool aspect of this bakery is how they really assist the keto lifestyle. Besides baked goods there are other snacks available for purchase as well as cookbooks and other paraphernalia related to carb free living. Also, they feature cool creations from local artists.  I'm not a low carber, carbs are life for me. But I'd come back! And I feel that is probably the best compliment a keto bakery could get.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Serpico is a gem for Philly. Ranking #9 on the 2019 Philly Top 50 from Philadelphia Magazine really doesn't do it justice.  Serpico has been around for a while, and for a good reason. From the moment you walk through the door, everything is incredibly well thought out--Friendly and knowledgable service, great variety of wine and cocktails, and out of this world menu options.    They suggest you order a lot of dishes, but I've​ been twice now with a total of 4 people in our party each time and have found that the perfect number of dishes is 8 (including dessert). You​ HAVE to get dessert.  The main attractions are the scallops, duck leg, hailbut, and dessert though the eggplant is also really well prepared.  Any of their wines pair well with all three courses and their cocktails are equally as exciting.  Diver Scallops: 10/10 stars if that's even possible. these are a must. Don't pass go, do not collect $200 until you've had these scallops, once you do, you can die happy. I'd even go so far as to suggest going for a few glasses of wine or cocktails and just the scallops at the bar. They're smooth and savory but equally as light and subtle.    Hamachi tartare: Good as an extra dish for the table but not the main attraction (again, refer to the diver scallops, they're the star of the show).  The tartare was light and fluffy but lacked in depth for me. The rest of the table loved this dish.  Japenese Eggplant: Interesting dish with a great flavor profile that is both unique and exciting.  Great for a vegetarian option.  Deep fried duck leg:  If you're coming for a cocktail and scallops you should also order this. It's equally as incredible as the scallops but on a totally different level.  Flavorful, slightly greasy, and naturally heavier than the scallops but when shared amongst the table, just the right amount of duck. Also a 10/10 and a must have.  Chicken and snail lasagna: This fell short for me and just didn't bring much to the table.  It seemed unique and interesting on the menu but didn't stick out as an exceptional dish compared to the others. You could do without this.  Halibut: One of the best preparations of halibut I have had in Philly (or anywhere for that matter). The carrot topping is decadadent and flavorful as is the halibut itself. The side of greens adds a brightness to the dish. Also a must have item on the menu.  Definitely not last and one of the most mind-boggling​ dishes was the Yuzu tart (sadly not currently on the menu as of April 2019, it could be seasonal).  This dessert was the perfect​​ combination of sweet and tart, light and fluffy, with an almost indescribable​ flavor profile. I would beg them to make this even if it's not on the menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

So I looked online and was skeptical at first based on previous reviews. Although, I thought I would give this place a chance. I got the combination Pizza and I could taste the difference. If you are concerned with fresh ingredients that aren't genetically modified I would suggest this place. They even told us they deliver further than their 5 mile radius for an extra fee. The owners were in the store when I wen't and they were very friendly and give you the local vibe. they truly want their customers to be happy, or at least that's how it seemed.

"Just wow! This truly is a unique spin on dessert. The desserts are a shaved ice with the consistency of ice cream when you bite into it. When you take your spoon and grab a bite full of the dessert it falls apart like sand in a sand castle. Truly unique and delicious!   My boyfriend tried the Smoreos and I tried the Cotton Candy! The Smoreos was primarily a chocolate flavor with crushed Oreos mixed in the ice topped with graham crackers, marshmallows and chocolate sauce! For the Cotton Candy I decided to add strawberry boba in place of the whipped cream and it was a great choice. Each bite was sweet and melted in my mouth - literally!   The best part is that you don't feel gross after eating this dessert, it feels fresh and satisfies the sweet tooth.

They frequently have a blackened chicken pasta on for special that I am not partial to, but everyone else in my group goes crazy for. If you are looking for an unassuming local spot that has a good atmosphere, good beer, and tasty food, I would certainly recommend this place.

I wish they had clam strips like Frenchy's does, but I opted for their chicken wings and a side salad, my wife got the seared tuna. Both were AMAZING, yes even for something normal like wings. Live musician did great (some of the music they play during sets is too hard for this crowd and sunset), and our serve ""Mo"" was great -- very attentive and we didn't feel neglected even with such a large crowd. We waited for a table out on the porch so we'd have sunset views, but then as it was setting a small crowd from inside came out to stand and watch and blocked our view... that's on them though, rude tourists.

"We had an 8PM reservation on a Saturday night, the parking lot was almost totally full, and the lobby was packed, the bar and bar area the same.  But we were taken right to our table, much to my surprise.  I was expecting a wait, there wasn't any, but then again maybe they knew I was a YELPER.  LOL  Starting with a wonderfully full to the brim Hendricks martini and my friend with a specialty prickly pear martini, and an excellent waiter, we were off to an experience to remember.  What a wonderful dinner menu, easy to choose, I wanted everything.  We started with the pear salad and the tuna tartare.  The salad fresh, superb, perfect dressed.  The tuna had a real nice spicy kick, the tuna was totally vein free and was exquisitely presented and subsequently devoured.  The scallops were extremely fresh, perfectly cooked and accompanied with a wonderful curried cauliflower and an extremely tasty parsnip puree.  The cod was light, flaky, moist, and topped with a shallot/thyme crust.  This dish was perfect in every way.  The whole night was a success, including the eclectic lively crowd, and the beautifully decorated dining rooms, service (he was also a great help with the wine choices), everything.

"This place should be a St. Louis tourist attraction!   Hopefully they branch out to west county, or closer to downtown.  When my family went to Vancouver, people were falling in line (sometimes for over an hour) to get a taste of the Japadog - Anthony Bourdain and Samantha Brown were big fans.  Well, I've tried the dogs at Japadog, and they have nothing compared to the offerings at Dogs and Fries. This St. Louis restaurant has the best fries and hotdogs I've ever tasted anywhere.  Location is not the best, but there is plenty of parking. Oustide it looks a bit run down, but inside the decor is industrial cool, sort of like Guerilla Street Food.

"went to this little place last night for dinner. Oooh, it was SO. DELICIOUS!  The owner is the sweeeeetest man, and he sat and chatted with us.   It took him 2.5 years to build and open this restaurant, and you can taste the love in his food.  We had (a lot): Sangria Garlic shrimp Toast w/fresh mozzarella Garlic crimini mushrooms Salmon nuggets garlic chicken casserole Chocolate flan Paella.  1. Garlic shrimp was great - i am not a big salt-eater, which sucks bc i live in the south. but this was fabulous.  2. Toast w/fresh mozz - OUT OF THIS WORLD! I wanted to order 50 more!  3. garlic mushrooms - yummmmm  4. salmon nuggets - cooked to perfection. golden crispy, with perfectly cooked salmon ... omigad, i want it now.  6. garlic chicken casserole - delicious  7. chocolate flan - OMG - not too sweet, not to bitter. PERFECT.  8. Paella - I still want to eat this all day every day. The flavors ... the ingredients. The leftovers were just as fantastic today as they were last night at dinner.

Just recently this discovered this gem and boy am I glad I did-It's been a long time coming!  My coworkers have visited this joint several times this week. I had to find out for myself what all the buzz was about.   Promptly greeted upon arrival by staff and were seated. I was extremely hungry so I placed an order immediately.   Our appetizer and complimentary app followed minutes after with our sparkling water.  Hummus was freshly made and you can tell it was used with only the finest ingredients.   The pita bread was fresh out the oven and ever so tasty.  Settled for the lamb kebab platter with rice. The temperature of the lamb was where it needed to be and cooked to perfection. The tzatziki sauce was nothing to sneeze at and paired very well with the lamb.  The chicken kebab is a game changer and might just be my new favorite go to from this spot.   I left with a satisfied appetite and full belly.   Highly recommend this joint.  Definitely two thumbs.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I ordered chicken fajitas and everything was so delicious and fresh. The chicken was so tender it ""flaked"" like tender white fish and was seasoned perfectly. The fajita veggies were perfectly cooked with incredible flavor. The toppings were all fresh, the guacamole was wonderful. Mmmmm!!! The tortilla chips were extremely fresh and crunchy and their salsa was delicious with a heat that sneaks up on you and gradually builds in intensity.

"I was in and ordered three soups to go, it was lunch time and very busy. The cashier​ was not friendly at all, I asked the prices when she asked what size and she seemed​ as if it was an unfair question. There is a chalkboard​ with the available soups on it and each soup is individually priced​. The cost is a bit high for soup but the taste was very good and it was packaged very carefully good portion sizes and served with bread. After ordering I went over to the side and watched the kitchen area and service line where large crocks​ are lined up keeping today's​​ selections hot. The older gentleman there was extremely friendly and made up for the cashier​. He had pride in the place and the soups. He mentioned he gets in very early to make the soups each day. The kitchen was clean and the service and people cooking were being very attentive to cleanliness​​ and health standards. I had the Cream of potato and the Creamy Tomato basil and a hearty Chicken noodle. All were excellent.

All the meat was cooked perfectly, nice char on the outside, sweet and fall off the bone tender in the inside. Pork rillette was set up with various pickled vegetables, beats and cauliflower, and what I am assuming is a pickled onion confit, or onion jam. Amazing can not state that enough. Baked beans had an harissa flavor profile that I never would of thought of coming together, and were the best I ever had. On that note the potatoes chips that came with the rillette were the best I ever had, fresh or store bought and need to be mass produced like yesterday.

"Ginza - Endless Sushi and Hibachi - March 26, 2016  Sat at the sushi bar which the first thing you notice is that the chairs are bolted to the floor. A little strange but regardless they were put in the right position for me, anyone taller may be uncomfortable.  Kani salad was ok. Too much smelt row. Could definitely use a little spice in the mayo.  As it is an endless Sushi & Hibachi restaurant, I ordered another Kani salad. I asked for less smelt and a little spice. They delivered a new salad with a lot less of the smelt roe, less mayo and no spice. They may not have understood what I asked for but I will try again.  Sushi was fresh and the perfect size. I ordered a salmon skin roll as I have been trying to find the perfect blend of crisp yet sweat and flavorful. This was definitely flavorful with a little red pepper taste. It was let down by the salmon skin not having that crispness to it.   Next I tried some sashimi. Salmon, tuna and a new taste for me, a surf clam. It reminded me of octopus, a little chewy and no real flavor but it was surprisingly good.  The salmon was a little fattie (not a bad thing) but again I couldn't fault the freshness.  Like a true Italian eats a salad at the end of the meal I did as the Japanese do and ordered a miso soup to end my meal. It was a little light on the tofu and seaweed however still one of the best I've had since moving to Florida just over a year ago.   I came in for a late lunch at 3:30pm and I guess 4pm is the staffs break time. I'm all about the staff needing somewhere to sit but as I was one of 3 people in the restaurant (only myself at the sushi bar) I found it a little odd that one of the chefs decided to sit a few chairs away from me. I may not have noticed him really but he was a loud eater.  The staff are very friendly, I think I had every server ask how I was doing. It was a little off putting if I am honest, maybe they felt sorry for me as I came in alone.  It should not be due to the fact I was ordering as I went as they recommend you do that on the first page of the menu. It may just have been out of boredom. I also noticed, how could I not, that the printers on the counter for the sushi orders let off a loud, high pitched beep that was very uncomfortable to the ear.  I didn't need to go but wanted to checkout the bathroom. As far as bathrooms go it was very clean and still looked new. The hand towel dispenser did not work and some previous patron chose to discard their hand towels on the side of the sink instead of the garbage. It just needs to be checked on a regular basis so this doesn't get left like it.   Overall I was thoroughly impressed. I definitely got my money's worth. I could have eaten more but they would have had to of rolled me out of the restaurant. Quality of food was hands down the best around these neck of the woods. I just hope they keep it up. Also a little marketing wouldn't hurt. I only saw the restaurant after picking up my dry cleaning.   So apart from the awkward chairs being on lock down, the beeping from the printers and the Kani salad, which was just not my preference in preparation (still delicious) I could not give them anything less than a five star rating. It was well worth the money. I am looking forward to returning to see if they will keep the five star rating.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

We arrived and were to it would be a 45 min wait to get a table which I fully understood due  to their reputation as  having First-rate Chicago style pizza but if this location that would not be the case after getting a table earlier than expected at 20 minutes I had already ordered the large Meat an More Meat pie while at the counter after looking at the receipt for the time ordered at 7:02 PM and being told that orders were  taking 45 minutes we received our order an hour and a half later with no apology from the staff for the late arrival of the pie    The staff Traditionally served the first two slices the white staff threw the pie up on the table riser asked if everything looked OK which should have been the first red flag .... The bottom crust was a soggy doughy unflavorful mess with the top edge a hard burnt and it's flavor equally lack luster , this chain brags  of its Huge amount of cheese it piles on their pies which was found to be very skimpy and also found to be  flavorless on this visit along with the toppings being in short supply I would expect    After spending $35 bucks for what was supposed  to be a top of the line premium Chicago style deep dish and receiving  less than mediocre 45 minutes late I will probably give this  location  another try to  make sure it wasn't a fluke I hope that it was a one off experience and the next time it's like that of its sister store at Castleton great service in a timely manner with a great taste",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I've been to other Rock Bottoms. This one has some issues. They forgot to put the side in a simple carry-out order. When we went in person a couple days later, it was about half full.  There were 4 employees hanging around the hostess stand, I could not tell what they were doing. The main hostess tells us an empty table near the front won't be clean for 10 minutes. Our party, and the 4 employees at the hostess stand, wait for 10 minutes, and someone from the back finally cleans the table and lets us sit, at our wet sticky table. Other dirty tables sat there unattended during our meal. For a brewery restaurant, you would think they would have at least one Porter or Stout, right? Darkest beer was a brown ale. They did have a $14.99 glass of basic chardonnay, I think the full bottle is $8.99 at the CVS.  The waitresses were good, although they have no beer knowledge.  Overall, the food is decent.

"I went to the opening day of the new deck. This place has the perfect location! You could drive or walk down the trail along the canal and cross over the bridge to stop for a bite. Our experience was beyond disappointing. The lady said to 'seat yourself' and that's exactly what we did. We sat and waited patiently for someone, and that never happened. After waiting 15 minutes we had to go inside to get some drinks at the bar, and then went back to our table. We sat their for probably an hour.

"I found this place from google reviews and thought by the pictures that it would be very good. When we walked in, it was 8:25pm and I was immediately told that they were closing soon. I said, "" well it's over a half hour away still "" and proceeded to order. Given I haven't been here before, I asked what the best, most popular pizza was and the gal said she didn't know. So I ordered the wild garlic and the wild Hawaiian. The food was OK at best! What was most concerning was the lack of attention and the lack of care from staff. Out pizza came quick but we were not given or offered utensils, ranch, Parmesan or drinks. I had to get up and ask and while standing at the bus station looking into the kitchen at the gal sitting against equipment on her phone, I literally had to ask over and over "" EXCUSE ME!!"" And never got a response from her. Finally another gal said she would help me. While eating, the phone rang multiple times and the staff ignored it, Walked up to the phone and looked at it and walked away. NO ANSWER! so I see that this place should be doing well, however it is clear from the lack of care from the staff, why this place is dead and not very good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"To be fair, I am not giving three stars because anything was wrong with the restaurant, I just want to let Yelpers know about my personal experience so they know what to expect.     I've always wanted to try Ethiopian food.   I am a *big* fan of Marcus Samuelsson on Food Network, and one time, I saw him win on ""Beat bobby Flay"" with an Ethiopian dish.   I was in Reno to see a show, and this place has very good reviews here on Yelp, so I decided to give it a try.     The restaurant sits in a Raley's strip mall.     You walk in, and it's small, but very neat and well kept.   An older Ethiopian lady runs both the kitchen and the front of the house.   She was very friendly.   I placed my order, and got my food pretty quick.    When I went in, I was not aware of the fact that Ethiopian food is inherently spicy.   When I looked at the menu, all but two items were listed as either ""spicy"", or ""very spicy.""   I don't ""do"" spice, so I chose the ""Alicha"" which is a mild beef stew.   The stew, as all dishes comes with injera bread, which is a spongy bread that you use to scoop up the food with using your hands.    The flavor of the stew was not bad,  but the texture  and the sourness of the bread . overtook the flavor of the dish.  I realize that injera is spongy so you can use it to scoop, and I realize that the sourness is meant to compliment the spicyness of the other dishes, but for me eating a mild dish, it just didn't work.     Again, I am not knocking the restaurant in any way personally, I just wanted to list my experience, so others going in will know what to expect.   I wish it had been a better experience for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Our waitress was pretty good, the mussels could have been a bit more flavorful, the seafood curry was amazing.

"I want to love Nora's but I'm not quite there.  Today we had the clam chowder. It was good, but nothing to write home about. Definitely had a super fishy odour! If I had some oyster crackers & hot sauce,  I could've made something happen.  I tried the Hangover. I really liked the bread & the thinly-sliced fresh turkey & salami. The sandwich was not hot though, instead it was warm on the outside, & cool in the middle. The grain mustard was nice but there was way too much & the flavour was way over-bearing. Upon dissecting my sandwich, to see if I could scrape some off, I discovered that the mustard was mixed with the bacon. So I let it be.  Husband had the cold turkey & seemed to enjoy himself.   The one thing that was really disappointing was the patio salad. There was absolutely no love there. Super duper bland. It needed salt, pepper, onion, mustard, celery, something!

"Thanks, fellow yelpers, for this recommendation--we've been looking for a new Chinese place for a while. I have to say that, for sheer convenience, this place might be winning out--online ordering plus delivery=a godsend on a lazy Sunday night.   That said, of the three dishes we ordered, we got brown sauce on two, so I was somewhat underwhelmed. Also, they were out of snap peas, so instead of snap peas and water chestnuts, we got broccoli and water chestnuts--which wasn't really what I was craving. Their chicken fried rice is amazing, though, and the Kung Bo shrimp had just the right amount of spiciness.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I ate here for the first time recently with a co-worker and had a really nice experience.  First off, some advice: sign up for their mailing list, holy discounts galore.  My co-worker and I signed up.  I immediately got $10 off and order of two pasta entrees large or small.  Then she received a coupon for a FREE pasta meal.  Perfect.  So we went and were greeted with fast service.  The hostess showed us around and walked us through the kitchen, pretty neat!  All the decor is really fun old-school Italian diner style, I liked it.  She took us to our table where our server quickly tended to us.  We showed her our free pasta coupon and ordered some side salads to go with it.  A few minutes later she brought delicious warm bread and oil to dip it in, yummmmmm.  A little bit later she brought our salads, a nice little Caesar for me, perfect amount of dressing, crunchy lettuce, big croutons.  Then she brought our giant ""small"" bowl of pasta.  We both ate and had seconds and enough to take home, bread too!  We ordered the Alfredo, it was pretty good, I liked the pasta.  It was very simple though, nothing thrilling, but I was more than happy with it considering it was free.  The left overs made for a fantastic lunch a few days later.

"I come here after work  with some of my coworkers for a few pints, some shots here and there along with  a quick appetizer after a long grueling 8-10 hrs.   I remember when this place used to have huge barrels of peanuts for you to eat, and after wards you would throw the shells on the floor. The peanut oil from the shell would keep the floor from getting scuffed up , along with keeping a nice coating over top, a natural polish you would say.    The bar is small in size they do have booths where you can sit  when the bar space is completely over taken. TVs line around the bar so you don't miss a beat in any sporting even, I did see one or  two with actual news on for the non sporting fans.  The craft beer selections on tap   are limited  not like the location in Newtown Sq where it is just a sea of taps after tap after tap . Good ambiance , kitchen stays open to about midnight for you to get that last order in.   The bartender every time I would come in has always been on the ball, never missed a beat with my drink, or any of the other patrons that are in there. The wings are good, as far as samplers go , go with the chi-town, its good.  I now substitute the fries for something else, normally I would ask for extra wings because sometimes those fries are hit or miss. Wings are always in play, no hit or miss there.

You dip the bread in the sauce.  Voila, you got Texas toast.  Girlfriend got stuffed crab.  There was plenty of crabmeat stuffing but a little too much moisture for me.

We got caught in a downpour on our way to Third Man Records and were looking for a nearby restaurant to dine at while we waited out the rain. Flyte was a few blocks away and bonus, they have a happy hour running until 7pm.   We grabbed a seat at their large bar and were promptly greeted by Tommy who I assume is both a bartender and bar manager. He was super knowledgable about their 6 paged wine list and made some suggestions to pair with our meal. I started off with their Tempranillo ($6 on happy hour and delicious) and Jesse ordered a whisky smash. The food happy hour was made up of small bar bites so we both opted for the full dinner menu. Jesse ordered the Chicory Pork Belly and red grouper stew and I went with the Atlantic red grouper entree. While our dishes were good they were wayyy to salty. I tasted the pork belly and found it dry, salty and a very small portion. The stew was light with a hint of citrus. The grouper was prepared lightly seared on a bed of sea island red peas, red Russian Kale and shaving of preserved lemon. While the grouper was cooked well it was salty however the island red peas and Russian kale were absolutely delicious.

We asked for ranch dressing, and instead of acknowledging we needed more she said that the person next to me had some so basically implying us to share? I've never experienced that before. At the end, our bills were completely wrong, she did not understand how the bills were being split even after explaining it several times. Would not recommend especially for the prices they charge  Edit :  waitress should not be touching people. Touching their backs, arms and placing her hand over others heads'. Not everyone is okay with this, and it makes most people uncomfortable. The 3 people who ordered ribs had very bad stomach problems as soon as they got home.

Marginal at best. For such a limited menu you would have expected them to be really good at one of them. Cheesesteak not as good as many other places in the area. Homesteader (one pork and one beef sandwich) was ordinary. Fries were typical frozen food section variety. The fact we were the only people in the place should have tipped us off.

"What more can be said about this place that other reviewers haven't said already. I loved it. We had four different pizzas, the Get Fresh, as an app (a bit sweet, but a bit of parm put it in perfect balance), the B.O.T (a nice, safe, altogether good pie), the Bayou Chicken (great flavors, but seemed to want one more bit of something), and the Mediterranean, which was one of the best pizzas I've eaten...service was great, food exceptional, I highly recommend!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I called ahead and was pleasantly surprised to hear that Philay can make almost every dish on her menu gluten free.  Take her advice on the heat level because her spices are definitely hot!

Avoid drive through, (slow service), if you use the drive through check your order before departing the pick up window.  The food is not always fresh or hot. Recent issue with the bagel bacon egg and cheese sandwich; (twice); stale.  Inside service is also slow at times and very slow when changing over to lunch. Always check your order for accuracy.

"My sister and our spouses were looking to try something new and I had heard good things about Hart so we decided to give it a try.  We had no reservations and the restaurant was fairly busy but the hostess was friendly, told us it would take a couple minutes to set a table up, and then sat us those couple of minutes later. That was definitely the highlight of this experience.  We were pretty excited about the menu, lots of dishes sounded amazing.   Unfortunately we never got to find out about any dishes. We sat for over 20 minutes without a server speaking to us. 2 different servers visited our neighbouring tables but neither looked our way. In watching other tables it would appear many were in a similar situation. I saw one customer make eye contact with a server, raise his hand to signal he needed something and the server turned away.  We walked out and spent our $200 down the road. And will not return.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I've been to Fuji Mountain twice and both times I've ordered the Pork Katsudon. The meat was a bit overcooked and the sauce was a bit too salty, but the sauce over the rice was delicious.I've had something similar at Sushiland, and that was delicious and much larger than the dish at Fuji Mountain.    I also ordered a roll, the name escapes me right now, but it was very spicy. There was no indications whatsoever on the menu otherwise I would have never ordered it.   The staff regularly came around to refill our drinks which was a positive.  However, as the waitress was serving me the dish, she drops it on the floor, which in actuality is fine since accidents do happen. What's not fine is: she did not even acknowledge me after she dropped it, did not apologize immediately, did not give me an estimated wait time, cleaned the mess up, and just left me hanging. It was not until I waited another 20 minutes did she finally give me my apology and my dish.   Can't say that I'll come back again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"*I'm writing this review because they just opened up the new location and the prices went up, sadly.*  Location: still on Country club but now located just south of Grant. The restaurant is bigger, has a nicer ambiance, with a lot more seating.   Food: The quality is still delicious. I prefer the food here over a lot of the other Arab/Mediterranean places around town.  Price: Here's the problem: The prices of all the food have gone up. All of the sandwiches went up $1 and all of the plates went up $2-3. Before, my chicken kabob plate (which came with rice, salad, chicken, & garlic sauce) was $9. It is now $12. (They've taken old menus and written over the old prices with a sharpie)  So I no longer view this place as a spot for affordable takeout (I can't afford $12 plates for lunch as a grad student these days).

"I'm going to have to go against the grain on this one and only give two stars. Let me start by saying that I liked the feel of this restaurant. The dining room was nicely decorated, the lighting was good, there were whimsical light fixtures decorated with empty wine bottles, and another in the next room outfitted with wine glasses. The table settings were nice except that I think they should consider including a second fork. If you want your guests to order more than one course, and lets face it, what good business person doesn't? I witnessed twice where a server had removed a plate from the table from the first course, along with the lone fork, only to have to take one from an empty table when the entrees were served. This could be avoided by simply providing a full place setting in the first place.   I had the New York Strip, while the partner in crime had Beef Stroganoff. We both felt that they were under seasoned. My steak was served with, or on rather, a pile of mashed potatoes. One of the most abundant elements found on this planet, salt, was nowhere to be found on this dish. I can only assume that this is because every other diner there that evening had about 35 years on us, and that the chef d' cuisine was concerned about patrons salt intake. Gotta keep them from pickling themselves before desert. The only flavor I could make out, beyond the obvious, beef and potato, was an over use of rosemary. One would think that a Parmesan crusted steak served with prosciutto would lend a little more flavor than just rosemary. I did not try the stroganoff, but I'm pretty sure I can take Ben D's word for it when he says it was rather bland. It still amuses me to think that this was a guy who was perfectly happy to call a can of Chef Boyardee dinner when I met him. I digress.   I'm pretty sure we'll give it another try. Nothing about this visit said they don't deserve another try. It is possible that they were just having anniversary jitters. We did pop in on what happened to be their one year anniversary after all.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Don't expect much from its food, but definitely a fun hang-out spot with a cozy atmosphere and decently priced drinks. I'd highly recommend the mango shandy or watermelon ricky. I'm a huge fan of fruity cocktails and these fit the bill.  Overpriced large plates and small portions on sandwiches, so stick with the snacks and sides. I have an unyielding affinity for wings so it was a must-try for my first time. Unfortunately, it was a should-not-try. Decent barbecue flavor and portion, but the wings came out borderline lukewarm and cooled way too quickly so the meat became chewy and unappetizing.   You can't go wrong with the fries and tater tots! Highlight of the evening. The bonito flakes with the tater tots was a bit odd, but the kewpie mayo was delish. I also gave the smoke trout spread a try - very reminiscent of tuna salad, but chunkier and thicker. The roe made the spread a bit salty and I would have liked a softer grain than the bagel chips, perhaps some pita.  Definitely a relaxing destination to be near the water while splurging on refreshing cocktails with friends, but still needs to step up its food game.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"So, I came in here on a Sunday. It is full of customers and there is about 3 groups in front of me: two groups of four, and one couple.  I have been standing in line now for almost 35 minutes. So this place is SLOW.  The lady that rings you up is also making the espresso and getting drinks; not the smartest idea at all, which explains the ridiculously long wait so far.    Looking at the menu, it is very minimum for the other crepe places I have eaten at. They also don't offer a side with your crepe. I wanted some fresh fruit and it was an upcharge of $2.00, but the portion was very generous.  If you choose no side, they throw an orange slice on the side for garnsih. The crepe portions are large though if you choose to get one big one.   More than an hour later from when I walked throuhh the front doors, I am still waiting for my crepe. This place needs more kitchen staff. Not really sure why it is taking so long for a crepe when they cook exceptionally fast. And the restaurant has plenty of open tables. So this place is just really slow.    This place would probably be great if there was no one here and you are the only customer.

Then they took the order and we waited as the place emptied. Some because they had eaten. Some because they gave up waiting for orders that never came. Forty minutes after we placed a simple order (burgers, onion rings, fries) we got the burgers. What about our sides? They are on their way. Ten minutes later we got the onion rings. As we had already eaten the burgers we said just cancel the fries and bring the check. We paid and asked to talk to a manager. The first manager we were brought to was already handling a complaint! The next manager was the person who seated us and promptly forgot us. She said she was aware of the issues. Apparently that meant she didn't need to address that with customers waiting for a meal that never fully arrived.

"I was very disappointed in my experience at Marrakesh. I had heard great things about how the experience was so unique and the food was absolutely delicious, but I have to disagree. I came for dinner on a Friday night with a large group (30+) so we had our own room on the second floor. The service was definitely lacking as things were pretty obviously unorganized from the moment we were waiting outside. They opened their doors 15 minutes late, with at least 40 people standing outside waiting to be seated (though we all had reservations). The patron must have asked us at least 5-6 times what party we were with. When we finally got seated, everything took so long - from washing our hands, getting our appetizers, and waiting for our courses. Maybe I understood the menu wrong, but weren't we supposed to be able to pick which courses we got? Each section of our room got a different course which was upsetting because a lot of people were looking forward to trying more. The Wharton students I was with had been there before with a smaller group on a different occasion and were very unhappy. The bill was astronomically expensive for dinner and the meat for the chicken was great, but honestly all the other meats and hummus were not that great. The belly dancing was sub-par as well and lasted about 2 whole minutes, I've seen better at Disneyworld's Marrakesh Restaurant and would much rather go there for around the same price per person for such better food, service and experience.

The pasta in the pasta fagioli was seemingly a day old and melted into a mushy broth substance when it hit your tounge.  We Ordered the seafood special.

We order mostly the fish tacos which are respectable.  In fact, it's the only taco that we have liked from Taqueria Corona.  The carne asada is pretty pathetic.  The tortilla is decent, so they are halfway there.  But the meat is dry and not well seasoned.  So the saving grace of TC is their fish tacos.  My cousin who recommended the place told me not to waste my time with anything but the fish tacos.  He's an idiot, so of course I ordered other stuff.  Turns out he is a genius.  Only the fish tacos are good. And they are just good, not killer.  They have a respectable few thick pieces of unknown fish lightly battered and served under a spicy tarter sauce.

The ceviche in a coconut was delicious . We also tried the strawberry salad with goat cheese. Super fresh . They have a lot of fun drinks. The service was very efficient .

"So, just got done with a nice fat Tuesday dinner with my mom and my boyfriend. First ordered chips and salsa delicious.. tostitos chips but ehh who's complaining. Then, we devoured some onion straws.. again amazing. My boyfriend and I ordered blackend salmon with garlic mash potatoes and a side ceaser salad and my mom got chicken fried chicken with mixed veggies and garlic mash potatoes. Sounds good right?? In true fashion our waitress brought out our salads first and we dig right in. Half way through our salads Weston says ""I just lost my appetite"" I look over and sure enough my appetite was immediatly gone. There, in his salad plate, was an acrylic nail. We flagged down the waitress and she apologized and got the owner. The owner apologized and said he doesn't know how it got there and fed us some crock about how the salads are made fresh to order.. he was nice but not believable. We carefully picked through the rest of our food and ate with caution. It was all delicious. And the incident did not reflect the waitresses tip. All the owner did was remove the ceaser salad from the bill.. which is understandable but working in the food service industry I know what my manager would have done and it would not be to remove the $0.50 salad. Great atmosphere, great service but not sure if we will be returning anytime soon I'm not a fan of acrylic with my salad.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"First of all we love char and have been three times now. So we chose this site for our nye dinner. There were limited spots when I reserve red so I took the 945 spot as opposed to super early. Little did I know the restaurant closed at 1000. We arrived early and waited ar the host stand for a solid 15 minutes before a host arrived to greet us. By the time we sat down, the server was nice but took our cocktail order and informed us that we would have to order the entire meal now because the kitchen closed in 5 minutes. We would also have to do last call and order 2nd drinks or a bottle if we wanted something else. As always the food was great, but the experience felt like we were imposing and needed to rush and eat quickly. Had I known that they were closing I would not have taken the reservation. However, I am confused as to why 1. The restaurant closed at 10 on nye. 2. Why they had a 945 reservation when they closed in 15 minutes. Very frustrating when you spend that much on a holiday celebration.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We were walking by and decided to stop in.  The host pointed to a table and threw some menus down without saying a single word let alone making eye contact.  We waited about 10 minutes for someone to come and ask for our drink order.  They brought out or water in a dirty glass and then our waiting really began.  We sat for 45 minutes and watched as other tables were seated, ordered and brought their food.  Our waiter hadn't even returned to refill our water.  After 45 minutes we got up told the manager we were leaving and took off.  Her only comment was ""oh they must have forgotten about you""",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"This place was good when it first opened, but in the past few years, i am consistantly disappointed, so i give up.  This final trip: Wait time was short, 10 minutes on a busy sunday. -super uncomfortable make-shift bench seating... painful -promptly took our order, great! Friendly wait staff -waited about an hour for food.......  got there just afterr 11, food served at 12 -flies in our syrup bottle... like, 5 fruit flies, because their syrup bottles are just open squeeze bottles... we were given a new one when we asked but blech...also lots of fruit flies buzzing around -french toast special was good. But it wasnt really french toast, so much as a cake- streussel type thing with ridiculously sweet raspberry sauce over it. -friends got the enchilada breakfast special...typically enchiladas have some type of sauce on them, these did not, but they were tasty.  -the decorating is tacky. Its like my 4th grade neice put her art projects up on the wall, and someone let her paint the sticky tables...merrrr  Bring back the Cowboy breakfast, re-vamp and simplify your decor, and hire an exterminator and faster cooks.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Came into Little Nonnas on a week night with no reservation and we were able to get a table. We had the Caesar salad and the fig bruschetta as appetizers- both were amazing.

"We've always passed by restaurant and by the pictures reviewers, it doesnt look too bad. We were hoping for an authentic chinese restaurant that had quality above regular chinese-american take out places. The first thing we see posted on the door is that they no longer have ""waitress service"". We enter a small and completely empty restaurant except for a man behind the counter and ask if we can eat in. He looked confused (probably because most people just take out) but said okay and set up a table for us. Because we had no waiter/waitress, ordering and asking for things was difficult as each time we needed something, we had to go up to the counter.  The food comes out and while it was very cheap (comparable to regular chinese take out places), it was very disappointing. The roasted pork and broccoli was extremely dry, the eggplants were weirdly orange colored and COLD, the rangoons were not fresh, the pepper steak dish was 70% vegetables, and the hot & sour soup was thin and added with non-traditional ingredients.  The best thing i can say about the restaurant is the price and that it is BYOB, however i would stay away from dining in; a carryout experience would probably be better.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I can't believe I have not been to this restaurant before. Intimate, fine dining within minutes from my place? What? I digress.  The restaurant feels as though it's in a Tuscan wine cellar: really cozy, a little dark with beautiful sconce lighting and maybe 10 tables with an adjacent dining area with several more tables. This Friday night introduced their new menu for the season with appetizers of fall salads, bisque, and various seafood and meat entrees.  A very nice selection of wines and spirits. I went with a Frothy Old Fashioned.  There was nothing frothy about the drink, and a bit more ice than I would have preferred, but very strong and beautiful color from crushed cherries.  I opted for a bowl of crab bisque, which at $8 is underpriced in my opinion. It was full of chunk crabmeat throughout with a  gorgeous creamy texture and wonderful flavor. My dining partner had the Hudson Valley Foie Gras w/port cherry compote. My entree was the Grilled Filet Mignon which was cooked to perfection. I prefer medium-well over medium-rare and it was tender, texture of butter, and just still pink enough to not be cooked too far.  The sides were cauliflower and thin, purple potato cakes-good, but not memorable. My partner chose the scallop entree. The entrees come in half portion size and a full portion. The waiter mentioned they were out of the full size portion scallop entree, so my partner opted for the half portion. We failed to ask, but we weren't sure if it was a difference in how many you are served; or, the actual size of the scallops.  It honestly looked as though it was an appetizer when it was brought out, but I was told they were delicious. There is a gentleman who assists the waiter and serves the water and passes out the bread. We were not served bread until we asked our waiter for it and he apologized for the oversight.  My cocktail took quite a while to come out, but our waiter comped the drink at the end of the meal, which was a very nice gesture and unexpected, as I had not complained or mentioned anything about it.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant! They also have a tempting breakfast menu that I plan on trying out in the near future.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"We've come to this place a million times over the past few years however The last day 4 or 5 visits have been a bust. I don't know what happened but many of the servers are new and have consistently messed up our orders. This last visit I walked in at 8:30 to grab a Pho to go. The guy told me the kitchen is closed so they couldn't serve me. The sign clearly says they close at 9. And I just wanted a soup. TO-GO. I mean, I get it but if that's the case then change your sign to read 8:30 pm. Not 9. Is that too much to ask? Needless to say that was the last straw and We won't ever be going there again.

"We came here on a whim after looking at Yelp and all the good reviews but did not like it at all. I wouldn't recommend going on a cold night like it was tonight because the door just opens right into the tiny restaurant and you get a freezing cold draft of air every time someone comes in or out.  Maybe it was an off night for them but the service was quite slow and the food not good. I would be willing to say it was the worst Thai food I have had and I have had a lot.  My husband and I both ordered the Pad Kee Mao, which I normally love. It was absolutely swimming in oil and had very little chicken or vegetables in it. We actually ordered extra vegetables for $3 each but each dish came out with about 4 strips of peppers and that was it. I questioned the waiter and he said something about how the vegetable delivery didn't come and so that was all they could put on. I'm pretty sure he wasn't going to mention that until I brought it up. He did at that point say they wouldn't charge us extra for the vegetables. The dish was very bland as well which was interesting because he had warned us that it was pretty spicy.  Our kids' food came out five minutes or more after ours did and there was no apology or anything for that. As a result our food was tepid by the time we ate it.  Our son had the pad Thai and thought it was pretty good. I tried it and liked it better than my dish but I could name a few Thai places in Stl that have better pad Thai.  The one positive was the crab rangoons.. We all liked those.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"When I went there my wife and I got the buffet (all u can eat sushi for $9.99).  The sushi was very average, but for $9.99 all u can eat it was good.

I asked the waitress and she told me it was a ""special blend"" they make themselves. For those who don't know the secret ingredient is WATER and a lot of it. I did not enjoy the sushi because of this problem. When I asked for normal soy sauce they told me they did not have any.  Really??!! no real soy sauce in a japanese restaurant.

"We had a group of 4 at 11:45am on a Friday and were seated w/o any wait, but I'll say it picked up immediately after, and it was packed.  Very nice decor and atmosphere, and the service was nice.  The meals arrived quite quickly.  From being seated until leaving, it took all 4 of us only 45 mins for appetizers and meal.  We split #34 Goi Cuon pork & shrimp spring rolls ($3.25) and #46 crispy rolls ($3.95) that came w/ lettuce, cilantro, and cucumber to wrap them in.  Both were delicious, and it would be hard to choose which one I liked better.  For my meal, I had the Bo Xao Tao ($12.95 off the dinner menu) beef and vegetable in a brown stew sauce that came in a hot pot.  They brought a huge bowl of white rice as well and a large extra plate.  You could mix the rice into the bowl or mix the rice, beef, veggies, and sauce on the plate.  Either way, I had more than 1/2 of the bowl and rice left over to take home.  Others in our group felt that the prices were a bit higher for Vietnamese and Chinese food.  Not many entrees under $10/plate.  So that's the main reason for 3 stars instead of 4, but as I get more familiar w/ this location and try other things on the menu, it's possible I'll raise that to 4 stars.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Ok. We were seated, asked what we wanted to drink, chips and salsa arrived with our drinks. Waitress said I will be right back to take your order. 30 minutes she never came back and we decided to leave. Especially when all she did was walk around and talk to the other girls.

No customer service what so ever. No apology, no let me take your order I will try to get you your order as fast as possible. NO I am sorry let me comp your drinks. No NOTHING. I looked for her name on the bill. All I seen was number 23 and Beautiful. (That might be her name)  We use to go when Manny was there. Never, ever had bad service with him.  If her name was Beautiful, she needs training on serving and customer service. As we were leaving we talked to 2 girls who were seated behind us. They we were with a party of girls.

"Management seems to be focusing more on the catering side of the business than the restaurant patrons. Since discovering DiFabio's a few years ago through a local friend and then moving to Media 6 months ago and so excited to live close and get to visit DiFabio's on a regular basis; we've noticed a decrease in the quality of the food, especially in light of the fact that their menu is pricey for the type of restaurant ($65 not including tip for pasta entree, small pizza, fries, two drinks, two cappuccinos.)  Last two visits ordered sweet potato fries, which used to be the best we ever had; both visits the fries were inedible-greasy, cold, and tasted rancid. When the waiter inquired if I wanted to box them since I hadn't eaten them, I politely told him they didn't taste right and I didn't want them. When we received the check, we were still charged for the fries.  My husband's pasta marinara dish didn't impress him either. The ravioli were smothered in marinara sauce and he said the sauce tasted overcooked.

"The first night we went to eat, the service was great! Antonio Jr was very outgoing, friendly and pleasant. The pastor meat was flavorful.   The second night we went, there was no pastor after we had ordered it. They asked what we wanted instead. We chose asada. The asada was not as flavorful and was a bit disappointed. Antonio wasn't there, so we had a different server. She was okay. Very little interaction with her.  We will probably try again if we visit again.

"Parc is one of those transporting destinations - the interior plucked from bistrots and brasseries in France and a menu scribed the same. Many will say it's an amusement park, an imposter, too kitchy. But I really can't find much wrong with this place. While I'm sure there are more authentic versions around, Parc c'est bon.  I've been here numerous times and covered all of the bases: breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner. I've never been disappointed.  Some highlights include the smoked fish platter at breakfast, the bouillabaise (Friday's plat du jour), and the roasted chicken at dinner. Oddly, the worst thing on the table is the bread basket (at dinner. brunch's is fantastic) - a glaring disparity.   I think Parc is at its best when diners can take full advantage of the outdoor seating facing Rittenhouse Square Park. This is prime real estate so be prepared to wait it out for a seat with a scenic view. And no matter when you go, Parc is usually packed so service can be a bit slow.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Had brunch at this restaurant and absolutely enjoyed the food. I had looked at their menu online and thought they would serve similar items for lunch on a Sunday, but instead found out they had just started to do a brunch menu which is totally different from their dinner menu. I was really hoping to try yakitori and ramen since I'm soon traveling to Tokyo but this wasn't available, so I will definitely have to come back to try it out. For brunch they serve some Japanese inspired breakfast dishes that are not the usual eggs and pancakes items that people often expect for brunch. These include fish items, miso soup among others. But they also have their version of American style items which include dishes like pulled pork and grits, and pulled pork and chicken sandwiches. The fried chicken sandwich was served with a sweet, spicy jelly on a brioche bun and it was so delicious and definitely spicy! The chicken was so tender but crunchy on the outside. The sake pulled pork sandwich was served with an runny egg also on a brioche bun. The pork was so flavorful. Both dishes were served with tempura shishito peppers which was a different but nice side item. Overall prices for the food seemed reasonable except for the coffee which will cost you $5 for a pour over and $6 for an iced coffee, a bit pricey in my opinion.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Both were good.  We also had the pretzels for an appetizer, which was great!!    There was a long wait for the pies so I do recommend ordering an appetizer or something if you're really hungry.

"Donuts and fried chicken. This is one of my favorites places ever.  Not only do they serve two of the finest foods known to man, but they happen to be so incredibly good, and the service is also outstanding.  My only problem here is that they sell out of everything too quickly. Make sure you get here earlier in the day to avoid disappointment (or don't, so that I won't be disappointed).  This time I was here, by about 1:30, they only had 2 out of 6 of their Fancy Donut flavors left. This was actually a good thing though, as I probably never would have ordered these flavors, and they were both excellent. We tried the Blackberry Anise and the Mango Coconut. At $2 each, these are an absolute steal.  Even cheaper, and just as delicious, are the Fresh Donuts, which are available in 3 different rotating flavors. These are only $1.25 each, and they fry them fresh on the spot for you, so you get them piping hot. There are few foods better than a fresh, hot donut, so you must make sure to try at least one of these. We tried the Vanilla Lavender on this visit, and it was really great.  As if that weren't enough, they also make some outstanding fried chicken. You can get a half chicken ($9) or a whole chicken ($17), which consists of breasts, thighs and drumsticks, or you can get wings ($9 for half a dozen). You can also choose from a ton of rotating dry or glazed preparations as well, which have all been great so far in my few visits. I've tried the Buttermilk Ranch and Za'atar here, both dry toppings, and both great. Like everything else, it all tasted so fresh. The chicken was incredibly juicy and tasty.  As if that weren't enough, they also give you a free, simple Honey Glazed donut with every order of fried chicken.  The service here is great. Every single worker is super friendly and is very helpful with suggestions. They are very talkative and frequently chat with customers, as the few seats in the small place are lined up at the counter.  I've been to more than my fair share of this new thing of Fried Chicken & Donut restaurants, and this one is by far the best. I  will keep on returning also because of the great variety. I came a year ago, and the entire selection of donuts was completely different. Any time I'm in Philly now, this is a must.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
My poboy was soggy and gross like it'd been sitting in its own juices for 15 minutes and the sauce was weird. Like old mayonnaise that had chunked a little.

When it was Riff's burgers, food was great, all meat ground on premises, lots of healthy choices like veggie burger, turkey burger, great affordable salads. But the service was disorganized mess and it was doomed because they never got that part together. Now this new place has table side service, but the food is not the same. Most menu items are deep fried, and less than mediocre. The burger is dry and there are no choices except beef burger. Nothing like the Riff's burger options.  French fries were terrible, limp and they tasted microwaved. The mac and cheese was not good either.  Chicken salad was good; croissant not good. We ordered a cupcake from bakery, which was so dry, we only ate the frosting. All salads are made with ice berg lettuce.

I also thought their practice of cutting gyros strips off the cone before they are ready to be served and then keeping them in the bottom of the pan was questionable.

I have given this place multiple opportunities after poor experiences as it is so close to my home.

There was not a staff member in sight but a full restaurant of hungry complaining guests.

"I love, love, love this place! I always try to stop by whenever we are in Philly, we actually came here a few times from NY just to have dinner here.  Did I mention that I love this place?  My ultimate goal is to try all of the dishes on the menu, which has been difficult as I always order the same 2-3 dishes each time.  See below for the dishes I have tried, which are ranked based on my preference:  Prah-Hok Kateeh - My absolute favorite dish and I have to order it every time I come here.  It doesn't look much in pictures, but trust me, you will love it.  It is basically ground pork that is flavored to perfection and you eat it with an assortment of vegetables.  I can eat this dish everyday!  Actually Khmer Kitchen inspired me to try to replicate this dish at home, I have tried a bunch of different variations of this dish using recipes from the internet, and none have even come close to the ones served here.  Sah-Law Machue Yuin - Another dish that I always order. It is a sweet and sour soup that comes with either chicken, fish or shrimp.  My personal favorite is the fish version.  Due to the fact that there are no Cambodian restaurants in NYC, I try to order a similar dish when I go to Vietnamese restaurants, but needless to say, none have come close to this dish.  I love the fresh pineapples (most other places use canned ones), and the gourd melon, which I have never had before I came here, now I love it!  Cha Throp - stir fried eggplant that comes with either pork or chicken.  I love the pork version, the pork just melts in your mouth.  The flavor could be similar to eggplant with garlic sauce from Chinese restaurants, but Khmer Kitchen uses big pieces of perfectly flavored pork instead of group pork, which I think makes a huge difference  Cha Mussels - The sauce for this dish is out of this world.  True story, my friend actually took the leftover sauce to go so that she can eat it over rice for lunch the next day, no mussels, just the sauce.  The mussels are great too, but the sauce this the star of this dish, and I kind of wish they serve bread with this dish so I can sop up that delicious heavenly sauce.  Pleah Sak-Koe- It is basically a rare beef salad.  For people who are a bit squeamish about eating rare beef, this is probably not the dish for you. For the more adventurous eaters, give this a chance.  It is super refreshing, particularly during the summer.  Could be a bit spicy, so be forewarned!  Sah-Law Machue Kr'ung - another soup with either chicken or beef.  I liked the aforementioned sweet and sour soup better, but this one has my favorite protein, i.e. beef.  The beef is super tender and flavorful.  I picked out all of the beef while everyone else was busy talking (no, that's not rude at all)  Kuh-Puh Ch'in - Shrimps that are lightly battered and fried to perfection.  I am not a huge fan of shrimp, but if I have to eat shrimp, I would eat this any day.  Cha La-Pauh - stir fried pumpkin with either chicken or pork.  I don't like pumpkin, but the pork in this dish is so yummy.  I had to be sneaky and pick out the pork as I did with the previously mentioned soup.  Everyone that liked pumpkins at the table raved about this dish.  Cha Kr'ung - stir fry dish with celery and pepper, comes with either chicken or beef.  It was just ok, nothing too spectacular to report.    Cha Lok-Lak - my least favorite dish.  It is basically beef cubes on a bed of lettuce.  Perhaps I should've dipped the beef in the sauce longer, but it is not as flavorful as the rest of the menu.  This is a family restaurant with the mother and grandmother in the back cooking, and coming here feels like going home to mom's cooking, well if your mom is Cambodian and an amazing cook.  The waiter is super friendly, I assume he's the son/grandson to the chefs.  He's always very patient in answering whatever questions we have, and always accommodating with all of the annoying requests I have (i.e. more vegetables for the Prah-Hok Kateeh, more napkins, takeout containers for the leftover sauce).  The only downside is that the hours can be unpredictable, so definitely call beforehand.  I have been disappointed numerous times because they had to close early, or open late for various reasons, as I don't live in Philly, I couldn't wait around for them to open.  It has been a running joke between us that we are 'lucky' if the place is actually open when they say they would.  However, they have a loyal customer in me, I will come back here again and again!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I really really wish this wasn't so close to my office.  Seriously.  I find myself looking at the sad can of Progresso soup, apple and sack of pretzels sitting on my shelf, and then I start daydreaming about kimchi, the spicy tofu/kinchi/pork belly soup, banchan (sides) and suddenly without knowing how, I'm all up in some Korea House.  The service is great here, they scold you if they haven't seen you for a while, and they are patient if you are an ignorant honky like me.  Seriously, a lot of other Asian restaurants in town kind of treat you like crap, I assume it is because they frequently get raided by low-tipping hipster douches, or maybe it is just a cultural thing.  But here, it reminds me of a trip to my Mamaw's.  If my Mamaw was Korean instead of a Southern lady schooled in the cuisine of Texas ranches.  They even serve the BBQ dishes on the same sizzling hot aluminum dishes with melamine holders my grandmother used to serve steaks on.  They are always coming out from the kitchen and checking on you, they'll even fill up your side dishes if you are a good eater.  Always patience and smiles all the way around.  Probably not my favorite Korean BBQ, a little on the greasy side for me, but their soups and stews more than make up for it.  And make sure that you get an egg dumped in your soup - it poaches while you wait for it to not be hotter than the surface of the sun, and is a nice addition to the bowl. Also, speaking of eggs, go for the Dolsot Bibimbop, it almost makes me not want to eat meat.  Almost.  Also, make sure to tip 'em, they give great service here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"To summarize and save you time, I would be willing to try it again. But for those of you who like substance to their pizza place reviews...  This place has a interesting atmosphere. It's a place that has slices for sale in the front, but then there is a full bar in there, too.   We got three whole pies for the 10 of us: a plain pie, a pepperoni pie, and a chicken ranch pie.  The pizza was pretty good. Not excellent, but tasty and huge. For a brick oven baked pizza, the crust was not as crispy as you usually get from those furnaces. It is dusted with garlic powder, so your breath will probably be kicking when you're done, so bring a mint for yourself and everyone else.    We also got a smathering of apps. The fries we got were decent, but needed some kind of dip, they didn't even bring us ketchup. The onion rings looked good but I didn't get to try'em. The wings also looked great, but again, did not try any.  They have a decent happy hour: $3 beer, wine or mixed drinks. That's not half bad.

"A Mother's Day nightmare. Avoid buffets here like the plaque, unless you are a fan of food borne illnesses.  I'm no stranger to dining on holidays or at buffets.  In fact, I took mom to Di Paolo's last year for the moms day buffet.  I didn't want to do it again (prefer sit down dining) but never thought the restaurants organizational skills and buffet could get worse!  Here's the thing folks on a regular night with a sit down dinner I'd give Di Paolo's 5 stars because the crab cakes are melt in your mouth, to die for good.  When in the hospitality industry I sent a good 20-30 guests their way. My world traveled FH even acquiesced to the awesomeness of their crab cakes.  The buffet was a whole other animal. One where tables were packed so tight I could grab sugar packets off the next table without getting up. Last year the restaurant sacrificed the smallest of 3 seating areas to have the buffet. This year, every iota of space was crammed with a table and the buffet was set up in front of the restrooms. That did not seem hygienic. Even worse as hungry patrons manhandled the tongs they would constantly be dropped into the food. People would then dig into the food with their fingers to retrieve them.     My mother was sick not long after eating here and if I had to pick the culprit it was the numerous guests handling the serving ware.   The food itself was fair to poor with pasta dishes being cold & rubbery and the fish & calamari being dry, chewy and overcooked.  The meat was bland and I did not taste or see a difference in the lamb versus the roast beef.    Food highlights included well crafted Caesar and strawberry spinach salads with fresh ingredients, homemade Italian wedding soup, and boxed pastries/desserts ( not sure where they came from, see pictures). My mother also enjoyed the chicken Marsala.   The mango rum martini was divine fruitiness but cost extra. Apparently $2 more even then the $8 suggested price on the cocktail list. The waitress did correct the overcharge.  The dining experience was not enjoyable as the buffet line wrapped around our table. Sitting at the end of our table, I was eye level with butts and got knocked with purses and elbows countless times. It was close to 6pm when I heard people in line comment they had reservations at 5 and this was their first trip up to the buffet. I only made 2 trips up and waited 15 minutes first time and 18 minutes my second time.   The organization was another huge pet peeve with the buffet. My family arrived 10 min prior to our 5pm seating and we were the second party in the door. Nobody greeted us until about 5:01 when the room was full and even then the hostess only checked us off a list. They were still setting tables 10 after 5 and they called parties randomly and not by arrival. Instead of staggering, every party was seated at once and it was a mad chaotic dash to the teeny buffet area.   To improve flow and guest comfort in the future I'd suggest the servers bring bread and antipasta to the tables and call tables up for the first go in a staggered manner so lines do not weave like vines around the tables. Also instead of 1 line for 4 stations have 4. I wanted soup but was told by a waitress I had to go through the dessert and salad line, because it was one line only. Despite the weak line system there were rude individuals walking up and helping themselves with no correction from the restaurant.  Consensus I heard from other patrons was displeasure with the buffet and lack of organization.  And because some people care, I'll also mention the new decor in the entrance area. It is a hideous combo of black, chrome and zebra which does not fit with the warm rustic  Tuscan feel that regulars associate Di Paolo's with. I heard and agreed with other patrons on this through the course of the night. The front room remodel is definitely a WTF were they thinking moment.  I love this restaurant but I will never go back to another buffet  EVER!   Pains me to give 2 stars but I have faith Di Paolo's will do the right thing with the buffet or scrap it and give the amazing sit down dining experience I love them for. I plan to return and review a regular night :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Duck...duck... duuuuuck... get the duuuuuuck! A tasty blend of duck, veggies and fried potatoes (that somehow come out tasting crunchy on the outside and yukon gold perfect on the inside).  Yeah, get this one..getitgetitgetit.  Breakfast sandwich...the homemade english muffin is heavy, especially when melded to two different cheeses, while a really nice sweet and smoky bacon provides a punch of flavor and the fried egg provides both bulk and drippy yolk for the muffin to soak up.  The spinach is there so your wife wont complain about your diet.  This is a sandwich that will fill you up and is better eaten with knife and fork.  More tomorrow..yes, im going back.

"Im Dominican and I most definitely know what's supposed to be going on. This place is good. I wouldn't go as far to say that the food is fresh but, it's delicious. The food is made then stays out in the open so that customers can choose what they want on their plate. Don't fear, the food is made well. Their natural juices are amazing and can either be made with milk or just water based. If you're on the healthy side, get the water based juice. The yuca con cebollas are divine and so is everything else.   I highly recommend this place if your out for lunch on a date, from work or simply craving a good bite.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"My lunch-buddy and I are always on the prowl for cheap eats and were happy to discover Dim Sum Garden's soup dumplings. Not only are they cheap, but for a little over $5, you get eight dumplings filled with delicious broth. I'm not saying it's fat free because once the broth began to cool, you could indeed see the congealed grease, but that's common with soups and/or gravies, right? Hey- I don't complain! I walk away with a belly full of delicious hot pork, broth and spare change. You'll also get hot tea and in and out in record time! I've tried other dumplings, too, and have been pleasantly surprised, but I keep coming back for the ""juicy"" dumplings.

"I've been on a mission to visit Taco Mama ever since it opened. The menu alone looked delicious, and I heard great things from those who tried it.  I ordered a burrito bowl with chicken, rice, black beans and a slew of other free toppings (I just picked them at random...I was too hungry to go in with any kind of strategy). I was surprised at the number of toppings offered, all of which were free of charge.  I didn't taste anything in the bowl that I didn't like. My concoction may not have been the most well designed in regard to flavor combinations, but it's hard to go wrong with Tex Mex in a bowl. My only issues were the wateriness of the bowl (I'm not sure what I included that would have contributed to so much water) as well as the very limited amount of queso - if any at all. However, neither of those had any major negative effect on the bowl as a whole.  The service was excellent. Every employee that I encountered was friendly. At least two visited our table to see how we were doing and to see if there was anything that they could get for us as well as remove stuff from the table after we had finished. That's very rare for a counter service restaurant.  I'll definitely be back to try more of the expansive menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
This is our favorite Philadelphia brunch place. I have no idea how I never reviewed it! I typically go for a Lox Benedict or the French toast. This time we had the pleasure of the GE chefs going into my imaginary food journal and their specials being my wildest dreams.   Sit down for this one: blueberry bomb French toast! Blueberries and marscapone  cheese. Dreams!   We also had the steak and eggs. The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked. High quality steak too! Not that chipped steak used in Philadelphia cheese steaks.   $40 for two people for brunch is steep (including tip) but I will be 100% keep coming back  Note : cash only,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"PokeMee is Bae. There's Fish in Salad or rice on one side, and There's also a boba half of the store as well.  There's two types of Poke Bowls: Regular Bowl: 3 Scoops of any meat Large Bowl: 5 Scoops of any meat  You can mix and match these such as getting 2 scoops of Tuna and a scoop of shrimp. You can get unlimited topping too. I recommend the crab meat, masago, wasabi mayo, tuna and cucumber.  This place gives a ton of rice even for the half and half salad /rice combo. There is just too much rice even when we requested 3/4 salad 1/4 rice.   The boba stand serves strange combinations or styles like Hot Boba, crepes, flavored ice.  I've been here a few times and they do miss on the occasional thing, like only having regular bowls one day or no change for cash on another.  This place is pretty good even at around $11-13 a bowl.

"It's been years since I've been back, please see my last review. And it will be a few years before I return.   I write this review here, in the restaurant, waiting about 15 minutes to speak to the manager, who ""will be out when she is done with her post"", as I was told by my server.   So I wanted to see who gets to finish their post first, me or the manager, giving her that 15 minute head start.   Let me start with the good: the French onion soup is the best in town.  Hands down.  Nobody comes close.  I also had the croque madame which was delightful, full of flavor yet delicate. The dessert was outstanding as well, the raspberry chocolate cake was bright and colorful and fresh.   The service was mixed.  She was pleasant and brought the food as fast as she could, but never asked how anything was.  Isn't this a must at any sit down restaurant?  And she disappeared after delivering the food until the bill was dropped off.  The REAL BIG disappointment is the lack of cleanliness, which is why I'm still waiting to speak to the manager, who just arrived...  The silverware was disgusting. I actually brought it to the bathroom to hand wash it myself because I remember how slow the service is. And my water glass had garbage stuck to the outside.

There was no taco bowl and the salad looked like a side salad with a little meat buried under the lettuce, and three to four chips on the side. I asked the waiter about the salad because in the past I have loved their taco bowls. He said they changed it.

"Vietnamese restaurants are known mainly in the US for their ""pho"", hot rice noodle soup.  But my favorite is actually ""bun"",  cooler noodles with just a little broth on the side.   I had the Bun Ga (cool noodles with chicken) with egg roll (#85 or thereabouts), and I loved it! It was $7.50. Soft drink with refills was $1.75.  It came with crushed peanuts on it, which was good. But I don't remember seeing peanuts mentioned as part of the ingredients in the description. So if you're allergic to anything, be sure to ask the waiter if it's in the dish you're considering. The menu was not written so as to mention common allergy items.  I really like bun dishes. They come with fresh bean sprouts, some green leafy stuff, mint, and (I think) lemongrass. The cool bun noodles are not refrigerator cold, but are more cool than warm. There is a small cup of soup broth served on the side. After I eat the meat part of the dish, I put the soup broth in the big bowl with the other ingredients and mix everything up. I don't know if that's the traditional way of eating it, but it's what I like.  Our Vietnamese waiter appeared to speak fluent English.  There's a big flat screen TV in the dining area.  They also have carry-out.  I'd have to rate this place at least equal to King Wok Nha Hang Co Do, and Sizzling Wok Hai, both of which are further up Lafayette Road (4100 to 4300 or so).  If I remember correctly, the restroom has been remodeled, and looked better than before. Decor is kind of dark and low-lighted. Ceiling is black and open (no drop-down ceiling tiles) exposing the rafters and HVAC but since it's all painted black, it works. They usually keep the blinds at the front window closed since it faces West.  The popular Bubble Tea is on the menu.  Menu is pretty extensive with well over 100 entres, sorted by type of dish, Pho or Bun, or rice combo.  All the other diners I overhead seemed to realy enjoy their meals too. The next table over asked the waiter to recommend a seafood entree, and they really liked it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Stopped in here on a trek around the city. I had this bookmarked for a while and when I found myself a few blocks away I couldn't miss the chance to drop by.   I was eating ""healthy"" and ordered what is easily the hugest ""garden salad"" I've ever been served. I expected a little bowl of greens and was pleasantly surprised with the amount of food that was delivered. Plenty to tide me over to the next mean. Unfortunately, the wings that my boyfriend ordered were dry and not super flavorful so that was disappointing.  I also had a tasting pour of the pretzel beer. I can't recall the precise name but it was pretty boring. I think if I hadn't had expectations that it would have some pretzeliness to it, I would have liked it just fine but flavor profile had no hint of pretzel. It was just a basic, boring beer.

Definitely not worth the money outside of the $25 three course meal you get during restaurant week, and even then the gelato really carries it. I also wasn't impressed with the service, our server took a very long time to check in on us, to the point that we were there for 2 hours and not out of choice.

The grilled romaine Caesar salad is fantastic and you can't go wrong with at of the pizzas! Like their drinks, they like to have a creative twist on classics, like the ""Maine shrimp roll.""

I'd heard goody goody was famous for their burgers so I opted for one of the signature burgers - the cheeseburger POX. Cheeseburger, pickles, onions and a special sauce. The special sauce is pretty much marinara sauce. Very weird. The burgers were pretty small too, especially for the price. I'd recommend 2 patties for anyone who's hungry.

"Husk reminds me of West LA life.  The food presentation, the decor, and the whole eat local.  The best thing about arriving is seeing the big board with all the handwritten meats/produce and where each particular item comes from.  It's pretty inspiring and interesting to see how much effort they put into it.   The staff are very knowledgable so if you have any questions, ask away!  My only pity is we overheard a table of girls that wanted gluten free and less carb.  Then don't fucking eat out!!! The gross life of the gluten free ... Actually who I really feel sorry for is the chefs who have to deal with this kind of behavior and modify their delicious dishes to cater to the clientele.  Hopefully it is a fad that doesn't last much longer.    The meat dishes were superb.  Everything was cooked perfectly, and we enjoyed the whole meal.  The duck was tender and had great flavor.   The shrimp n grits is definitely a must get.  The flavor bomb is intense, but in a good way.  Usually I am not a huge fan of 'the foam' as it rarely has any real meaning or adds to the dish that complements it, but I found the foam in the shrimp n grits to actually work well.  The cornbread was explained as how they ""used to make it"" in the olden days.  So it's a lot grittier and more like that stone wheat quality to it.  It's a bit dry so if you aren't really into the mealy component of cornbread, it may not be for you.  For me, I rather enjoyed it - interesting to see how they used to make cornbread and how far it's come.   Husk - a good experience overall, very nice decor.

"As a Quarterite, this has been one of my favorite restaurants since it opened, especially since it has an oyster bar combined with white table cloth service - those are usually mutually exclusive. I would always start with something unique to this restaurant, the Trio, a dozen oysters consisting of 4 oysters Rockefeller, Bienville, and Fonseca each. It was to die for! Now they have evidently succumbed to the Charbroiled oyster craze, which were very good, but something now found everywhere in New Orleans. For me, it was their signature dish, and the reason I would always take out of town visitors there. I asked the waiter if they couldn't make them anyway, given they still have the equipment to make them, and he said they had not made up the sauces that go on top. If that's all it takes, it seems they could offer both dishes, the charbroiled for all the tourists, and the Trio for the many locals like me that like something out of the ordinary.

Being a LA native who now lives out of state, I love trying new places every time I make it back to Nola. I was ready to give Vincent's a try when in town with family and friends and simply wish now that I hadn't. Let me break this down for you: 1) To begin, the restaurant screwed up our reservation but was nice enough to hold our table until the correct time. Appreciate that. 2) The waitress- RUDE! Beyond embarrassing how she spoke to me when I attempted to order a virgin cocktail for my pregnant sister. She completely shut me down and said ""we can't do that"" before continuing to make comments and speak to me like a child. I love being spoken down to and the icing on the cake was the fact that she completely embarrassed someone for being pregnant.  3) She (i.e. Waitress of the year) then chose not to write anything down and then had to ask each of us multiple times what we had ordered, blaming it on me and ""the drink incident"". Yes, that was completely my fault that you chose to depend on your memory for a ten person table... 4) The entire time, from the drinks all the way until the end of the meal it was clear the restaurant had no clue what we had ordered. They would just bring stuff by and guess until they got our drinks, salad, and entrees correct.  5) The food itself was decent, but nothing to brag about.  While I understand that things were crazy due to it being Jazzfest weekend, that is still not an excuse for speaking to me in the manner that she did. Embarrassing to have a place with people like that representing the New Orleans food scene.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Just your average pho.  Except the service wasn't very good- the food came out fast but you're eating piping hot food and they were slacking on the drinks.  I will admit that the bowls though are larger than any other place I've been to ever. Very reasonable prices for the amount of food that you get.  We got their pork summer rolls as well and they were great. Try it with a side of peanut sauce- you won't be disappointed.  But can I ask the question that has been racking my mind for ages when it comes to pho places? Why can't they have some lemons for your water! You ask for lemon, you get lime...100% of the time. It's crazy! Seriously though; why is that?!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Wow....based on all the 4 & 5 start reviews, thought we'd give a try. It was the first time eating there and the restaurant  was not too busy buy the time we got there. I ordered a glass of merlot and I could tell just by the smell that it wasn't good and the sip I took just confirmed it. Tasted like it was the chef's old cooking wine. Horrid. I told the server and she was kind enough to open another bottle.  The new bottle was much better - but just not a good wine in general. Asked for a glass of water - which was not filtered and tasted worse than my tap water at home. I didn't order food but my sister had the short ribs which were very nicely presented. As she took a bite the look on her face told me this was not going to be one of her better meals. I took a taste of the short ribs which were nice and tender but most of it tasted like they were cooked with old rancid oil..the veggies as well. She had a few more bites and that was it. Our server was very nice and accommodating as my sister and her husband have certain foods they can't eat. I truly want our local establishments to do well, but quite honestly I don't know that I would take the chance of going back. I know my sister and her husband certainly won't. Hoping the manager will see this and look into these issues.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"It was okay, but it didn't knock my socks off or leave me yearning to go back. Heck, it didn't even make me go home to my hubby and tell him we have to go there sometime. The happy hour prices were great on beer and wine, but I didn't indulge. They also have 2-4-1 on wells and calls. If I go back, it would be for their late night happy hour with half price pizzas and calzones along with 2-4-1 drinks.   I met some friends here on a weekday night around 6:30. It wasn't very crowded, which is a good thing because they don't take reservations. The outside area looks really nice, but we dined in due to the cold. The ambiance is great, but it has an odd smell. The bathroom was even worse, smelling very musty. The noise level was good, and the service was okay. While I waited for my friends, the waiter barely checked on me.   I ordered the Tre Funghi as a calzone, and it wasn't even mentionable. It was mostly air! And mine had a huge blowout so instead of a doughy and cheesy experience, the top part was hard and thin. The mushrooms didn't taste fresh; they tasted like they were from a can. And for a calzone, it sure lacked cheese. I wouldn't order it again or recommend it. The marinara was good, however. My friends seemed to like their pasta dishes, so that's what I'd go with next time if I were to come back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Gosh. Yelp reviewers almost never let me down. But this place and burger, after so much hype, was a total disappointment. The place is small, hot, greasy, with little to no atmosphere. And a tall guy constantly coming around and emptying the trash as loud as possible. I got the standard burger, with everything on it (including Benton bacon and grilled onions) and ordered it medium (normally all come medium rare.) It came well done. The bun was fine, a little burned. The burger was not even as good as a burger from a place like Backyard Burger. The fries were good. And lastly, the sign ""sorry, due to our small size of restaurant, our milkshake machine won't fit here so you can only get milkshakes at the other location"". Ok. I'm out. Wife said ""well, were never going there again"". Maybe the other location is eons better?  I sure hope so for their sake.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

But that's where the good things end!!!  The food tasted so sour and the rice tasted like fart. The vegetarian options are also very limited, and the vegetarian food they have is also very odd and disgusting, and I don't even think there was a flour tortilla in my enchilada! There was so much god damn cheese! The beans were also dryer than the Sahara desert and there were carrots and cauliflowers in there. I've never seen that before!!!

Pros: great location with beautiful views. Cons: the food. I ordered the stuffed lobster - it had a thick coating of old bay spicy seasoning crusted on the lobster and crab making it inedible. My boyfriend ordered the Chilean sea bass which was not cooked. The steak fries are not French fries but rather deep fries potato quarters. Yuck.

"Just in case no one has caught on yet, Nam Phuong has switched owners some time in the past few months.  I didn't think there would be such a noticeable decline in their food so soon after the change.  The original Nam Phuong team has permantly moved to the other smaller Nam Phuong, now renamed Nam Son.  (16th and Washington)  I never thought the smaller Nam Phuong/ Nam Son was that great but since the change, the food there has gotten a lot better.  They have Vietnamese hoagies there, which is a definite plus.  Actually, the menu is almost the same as the Original NP with a few more items.  However, it is a smaller restaurant, in a shadier neighborhood, with no liquor license.  But hey....it could be the Vietnamese Tiffin.  I guess it depends on your priorties, better food or bigger restaurant.  The service in both places is spotty however.  Neither the new owners nor the old owners have figured out how to correct this issue.  You get what you pay for I suppose.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Tried out the new Culver's in Wesley Chapel. Ordered the Wisconsin Melt with Fries and Drink. Liked the sitting and taking a number so a server can bring the food. The sandwich was a little bland and the fries were very good. Added mayo to the sandwich and that made it much better. Overall I would like to come back to form a real opinion about the place.

We shared a couple of sides - onion rings were phenomenal, sweet potato tots where just fine... but the marshmallow side was a cool touch. I am ashamed to say that I ordered a Krispy Kreme milkshake... and I am even more ashamed to say that I loved it!  Much pricier than a typical burger joint, with a longer wait and slower service (basically, everything I expected because of the ""Boutique"" in the name!)... but I will go back again.

If I could 0 stars I would! First walk in there are only 3 customers and it's not busy. One waitress for up front which is no problem since it's not very many customers. We were told right away to seat ourselves which is fine I kinda like that choice. However only 3 customers at one table were getting attention. A couple of gentlemen were already sitting at a table before we got there and didn't have menus or any drinks much less water. After another 5 minutes they had their order taken. The waitress did respond a couple times she would be with us in a minute which at least we were acknowledged. But after having to hunt down breakfast menus ourselves and over 15 minutes of no service we left!!! Sorry that prepping like making tea and filling sugar and stocking the back station is more important than Customer service here!! The Drive thru pretty sad too as when we were leaving a couple in the car out front (Not in the drive thru window) (that would mess with their times so can't have that!) were upset and had been sitting almost 15 minutes according to them) for 2 breakfast items.

We weren't greeted by our party host at the door, we finally met our host at our table (Jazmin). She wasn't enthusiastic about being there at all. As soon as she explained everything to me, I made sure to start ordering our food already that way before our guests came, they won't have to wait too long. Nooooot!! Our food came an hr. and a half later! Boooo! All of our guests were hungry! The pizza were okay and the wings platter that we ordered didn't come until another 30mins. later! We had a very bad experienced here. In addition, our guests were treated poorly and not only that, some of their staff were rude.

"Being from San Diego, I like to think of myself as an authority on 24 hour taquerias. Especially one food item in particular, a dish that originated in San Diego...carne asada fries. Or ""Super Fries"" as they are referred to here. Back home in San Diego, this dish is my barometer for any new taquerias I visit. So when I saw that a place in Indy had my ""go to"" item, I knew I had to give them a try. First thing I noticed was they use crinkle cut fries. That's always a big no no for me. The best fries are always the regular cut French fries. Not steak cut, not waffle fries, not crinkle cut. Another no no is adding pico de gallo and beans to the dish. There are places in San Diego that do this, too. And those are the places that nobody goes to for fries. Just sayin'. But aside from that, the flavor of the dish was pretty good. The carne asada seemed really chopped up. Almost diced. I'm used to the carne asada having bigger chunks, but it wasn't horrible and didn't affect the taste. Overall it wasn't bad. I've definitely had much worse in the San Francisco area believe it or not. I can't eat carne asada fries all the time, but if I'm in Indy and have a craving I'll definitely stop by here for a modified order of Super Fries.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I only ordered lettuce and mayo and got a handful of bad lettuce and a big pile of mayo in the middle of my sandwich. I wanted a fountain  drink but the ice was out so I was given a can! I should have gone another block down the road to Jimmy Jonhs!! The family that I think owns this location is very friendly to their customers.

The first time I asked for one sandwich and got another. Rather than send it back, I just alerted the waitress and finished it. After we were done, the waitress said it was a good thing because the sandwich I ordered was more expensive anyway.  The second time my husband asked for an Italian sub, mayo on the side, peppers on the side, no oil. We didn't get peppers and the sub was slathered with oil and when we brought it to the waitresses attention she denied culpability and said she put it in the system correctly.

"alright look the food is awesome, just like every other Olive Garden. the location is ideal being right on the Boulevard and easy to get to. the staff however are lacking in a couple things. one of which being personality, or really showing any emotion at all other than anger. for some reason every single employee in this specific restaurant looks at you like you killed their little puppy and baby brother. god forbid you go to the bar, because then your looked at like a crazy alcoholic even though you asked for a Shirley Temple for your child. the wait staff is true to its name, since you're sitting there waiting for at least a half hour before they even come and ask you what to drink. then you have to wait another 20 minutes for those drinks to come back to your table, and then you get to order your food. fast forward 45 to 50 minutes you're finally evening depending on what you were there it may or may not be piping hot most likely not. If you come here you need to be really patient. I love their food, I love the atmosphere, however I'm not a patient person if I'm hungry I want my food. I'm thirsty give me my soda. I know two people who work here, both are very nice people and they're very quick outside of work so I don't know why so freaking slow when serving.

"This was an enjoyable meal, met my expectations. We started off with 2 drinks, the poppy doble and unholy water. Both were very unique tasting cocktails, but I expected that since the bar manager used to manage at APO. Both drinks were refreshing, perfect for the summer. I have also tried the Lady Grey on another occasion, and that was really goood, although a bit lacking in volume.   We started off with some grilled rock octopus. This was probably the best dish here! it was full of flavor, and the texture was great. Might have been the best octopus i've ever had! It's kinda expensive at $12, but it was damn good.   Next we had the Tater tots, I would say these weren't your typical tots, different texture, more mushy and slight different flavor. The sauce that came with it was good. Worth a try but probably would not order it again because it wasn't really worth the price.   We also had the kool aid pickled watermelon, which was basically watermelon with some pickles... kinda expensive just for watermelon, I didn't even taste too much of the kool aid. It was refreshing though for summer.  For entrees we got the Skate and the whole fish which was a black bass I think. I've never had Skate, and it was really good, cooked perfectly and the sauce was great. The black bass was great too, especially the sauce, it had a little spice to it which was great; it too was cooked perfectly.  For dessert we got the coconut bread pudding which was delicious! it came in its own small little individual pan, which gave it a nice burnt crispy crust on the sides. The taste was not too sweet but not too bland. This was definitely a treat, and one of the best desserts I have had.  I would definately recommend this place. Great drinks, great food!

I didn't even remind her about it because I knew I wouldn't get it for another 20 minutes, and by then, what was the point of ""bottomless""?   We got a couple of entremets, and while they were gorgeous, they didn't actually taste that great, and definitely weren't worth $8 each. After we finished eating our (quite good) omelette, it took Ariel another 10 minutes to notice that we needed our check. We sat at the bar and felt totally ignored.

Their menu offers a wide range of toppings, sauces and cheeses to choose from. If you're not in the mood on building you own pizza, they have the feast options too. I usually go for the BBQ Chicken which is loaded with chicken, onions, bacon, peppers, cheese and of course barbecue sauce. The pizza is really delicious and goes great with their ranch dipping sauce though I mostly pour it across my slice. Yum!  Domino's has takeout and delivery, and are usually quick with their orders. During my last visit, I waited about 15 minutes for two large pizzas. Pretty fast during noon time! The staff are friendly and helpful and I have nothing bad I can say about them.

"When a friend first suggested going to Sang Kee, I went there half out of curiosity-- a Chinese restaurant in Sheraton Hotel? Let's see how good it is!  Sang Kee did not disappoint me at all-- in fact, I greatly enjoyed my visit and returned there several times both for its quality of food and the ambience. The restaurant is very spacious and well-lit. There are always a considerable number of people; however, it is never too loud to have a conversation with the person you are eating with. I've tried various different types of dishes-- honey almond shrimp, beef noodle soup, dim sum (pork buns, shrimp/pork shu mai, egg tarts), some sort of marinated duck noodle. The portion size is fulfilling, and the amount of sauce is adequate. Especially if you are hungry and want some fast-served slow food, this is the place for you. We literally got our beef noodle soup in less than three minutes after we made an order.  My all-time favorite dish at Sang Kee is honey almond shrimp -- extreme crispness outside with lots of coated almonds and honey (the sweetness isn't overwhelming though) with chewy, huge shrimp meat inside. You should give it a try!  Just looking at the quality of food, I'd give the place 3.5 stars, since everything in general is pretty good but not ""outstanding."" (except for honey almond shrimp, in my opinion) Also, the place is slightly pricier than other Chinese restaurants in University City. However, the fact that you can eat at a very clean, nicely decorated Chinese restaurant in University City is a rarity and I'd be totally down to pay $1-$2 premium for this ambience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

There was no actual salad option. I ended up getting a steak, which was very good, but it was quite expensive for something I didn't particularly want in the first place.   Now a moment to air my current pet peeve - menus where every item requires a definition or an explanation. I've been seeing this a lot lately and it was especially the case at Flyte. It just seems like showing off, when the focus (in my humble opinion) should be on serving good food. Ok - off my soapbox now.   I'm sure I'll still go to Flyte for their happy hour, but am not inclined to return for dinner.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
This place has slowly gone downhill.  Charles and his staff have always been so great that we've looked past some obvious and glaring miss-steps.  This last time was the worst.  The lo-mein with veggie ham tasted as though it had been re-heated.  The place has also gone downhill in a correlary fashion in its popularity.  We were the only ones there for a meal at 1pm on a nice Sunday afternoon in August.  Every other Chinese restaurant in Chinatown was packed.  Maybe this is a place who's sun has set.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Food at Thai 202 is mostly fine, but very rarely anything special. Phad Thai is overly sweet and lacks texture. Phad Kee Mao is gloopy and lacks ""wok hay,"" that lovely smoky flavor imparted from a hot wok. The curries are slightly better, but as often happens the vegetables are lame.  Also, on a particularly annoying note for someone looking to order takeout, Thai 202 regularly closes well before it's published closing time, or simply refuses to pick up the phone. Don't expect open doors past 8:15 despite a 9:00 closing time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

This is exactly what you want in a local eatery. Great food, great staff, and a totally relaxed atmosphere. I enjoyed the Savoy Benedict. Perfectly poached eggs served with black forest ham and a delightful Charon sauce, placed on a grilled Ciabatta roll. Extraordinary! My wife had their Quiche of the Moment. This day it was the Quiche Lorraine with bacon Swiss cheese and onion. Very nice! Our friend had the house made granola with Greek yogurt. We also had the carrot cake featured on the show.

"Tonight we attempted to have dinner here and it was one of the worst meals I have had In Philadelphia. We were a party of six and when we arrived the hostess simply pointed her thumb to the back of the restaurant where our 4 other friends had been seated. The salad speciial was prosciutto wrapped around string beans with Gorgonzola cheese. Sounds good, taste was ok, but the prosciutto was gray. It was downhill from there. I ordered the fish of the day, cod, could not eat it. It had the texture of grits without any flavor. They took it back and I ordered the pasta special shell fish over pasta. They forgot to cook the pasta, it had no flavor and I picked at the seafood and left the pasta. It gets worse. As a party of 6 they added a gratuity, 20%, ok a little higher than the 18% that is the normal tip for larger parties,however, the 20% was applied to dinner and the tax total, OUTRAGEOUS. Three couples and each used a credit card to pay the bill; I was informed they could only accept 2 cards, with a little persuasion on my part they took all three.

"Okay, so I rarely do reviews. But I really think this deserves it.  I went to this location yesterday for lunch.  Ordering: The process for ordering the food was a little confusing. Not the end of the world... but why not just take our whole order at the start of the process?   Price: Over priced for what you get.   Quality: My meal tasted fine - not spectacular. For the price I expected to find it was more outstanding rather then middle of the road. My wife didn't even finish hers.  She ordered soup - and it was cold. Not ice cold, but certainly short of warm. And a flatbread that just wasn't appetizing.   Other: When I paid there was an option for ""tip."" I always tip. 15% if I get bad service, 20-25% if I get good service. But that is usually at places where they seat you, take your order at the table, and bring your food to you.  Actual SERVICE at your table. This is more of a cafeteria style line. Why would they ask for a tip!? I tipped, because that's what I do, but I don't think it appropriate for them to ask for a tip in this dining format.   I'm giving it two stars, because I did like my meal, but there are just too many issues here imo.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Jian Korean Cuisine is located on the second floor of HMart in a food court. It's the stall that's all the way in the corner. There's usually parking in front of the supermarket and there's a lot across the street as well.   I got the Yookgaejang ($8.99) and it comes with kimchi, pickles, and water. For the amount of food they give you I think it's not too badly priced. I think some items on the menu are better than others though. I enjoyed my dish and thought it was flavorful, but the dish that my friend ordered tasted odd. My soup definitely hit the spot and satisfied my craving, but this isn't a place that I'd purposefully come to unless I was also grocery shopping.

Dimsum house definitely takes your average dimsum dishes and places it in a more upscale environment than your usual Chinatown setting (which also means marking the price up a couple dollars)   The dishes here are really well made and enjoyable.

"I think Nebraska Mini Mart is an awesome addition to Seminole Heights!  Love the whole concept of walk up, order food and drinks, then enjoy the outdoor games/general area. They call you over the PA once your food is ready and for some reason, I really enjoy that.   They are kid and dog-friendly - and it was a great place to hang out when our friends with three kids came to visit. They could run around (controlled and supervised) without worrying about having to be shushed.  Minus 1/2 star because I think the games are priced a little expensive.  However, they have been having a lot of ""free game"" specials, so that's bee nice.  Minus another 1/2 star because I would love to see additional covered options. They do have an indoor area, but it feels so disconnected from the whole feel of the place.  With the Florida sun/rain, perhaps putting some kind of cover/roof structure over half of the grassy area would be a good investment to ensure business keeps coming even when the weather doesn't cooperate!

"Been going to this place for 5 years and it has gotten worse and worse with every year. Every time I go I say it's going to be my last but I always go back to give it one more try. And every time it reminds me of why I shouldn't bother.   Dining in: The host/hostesses are always on their phones and act like seating you is the biggest inconvenience of their day. How dare I want to come here and pay you for overpriced food? Longest service ever. I don't entirely blame the wait staff because I believe the kitchen is the hold up. But don't ask for a cinnamon bun. You'll wait 20 mins. The food is good, don't get me wrong. But $45 for a breakfast for 2? C'mon..   I'm pretty sure this salvaged and restored authentic diner straight from the 50's is supposed to be 50's theme down to the milkshake menu. They used to play 50's - 80's diner-themed music which added to the ambience of the place. But now it's R&B at Soul at 9am.   Take-out: WORST. They need to teach employees to interact over the phone. Employees are rude and virtually incompetent. It would be better if they had an online way of ordering so you know that your order has even gone through and you won't be treated like you're bothering them.  90% of the time we come home to find our order is wrong OR we're told upon arrival for pick-up that they're out of what we ordered. Then we have to wait for a new order to be made.

But the worst thing was that at the end of the meal, we had been looking forward to eating the yeasty bread ( injera ) that had been sitting under the dishes on the large platter as it had sopped up all the juices and looked yummy, it was not ! It had a really weird chemical taste, very overpowering and we were concerned that it could be unsafe to eat, as the platter the food was served on was plastic and I have no idea if it was food grade plastic, especially with having acidic food on top which  leaches stuff out. I would have told the owner, but she seemd very unreceptive to any  input, as demonstrated earlier.

"It has been a few years since I was last at Bahama Breeze and, wow, it is still packed and the food is still as delicious, if not even more, than I remembered. On a Sat afternoon after biking on the Courtney Campbell Causeway my 2 friends and I decided to eat lunch at BB. We got there around 2pm and practically had to fight for a table on the patio. BB is located right next to the water, it was a semi-hot and sunny day so, of course, everyone wanted to sit outdoors to take in the sun and scenery. I noticed the patio got bigger since I was last there. Nice addition! There's still a guy playing cheerful Bahamian music. I enjoy him most of the times except it does get too loud. Try to get a table further away from the stage otherwise you'll end up screaming to your friends.  The menu, too, seemed to have been revised since I was last there. I ordered the Fish Tacos. They were a bit bland for my taste. The fish is nicely grilled and big, but I thought the cabbage could use some seasoning. The fish tacos come with a side so I chose the Tomato Salad. Disappointing! The side is literally just diced fresh tomatoes, that's it. It tasted like there's no seasoning, no dressing, absolutely nothing else was added to the diced tomatoes.  1 of my friends ordered a chicken dish that she inhaled because she was so hungry from biking. I suspect it was good. The other friend ordered 2 appetizers which she seemed to like as well.  For dessert, the 3 of us shared a Warm Chocolate Pineapple Upside Down Cake. The cake has a molten center, which was super hot and gooey. This cake is devine! I'm quite certain I have never had a better cake. I wanted to ordered a 2nd one just for me, unfortunately, I can't afford the calories. You don't even want to know.  Coming back to Bahama Breeze brings back fond memories of when I went on a regular basis.

It just wasn't the level of freshness and homemade flavors that one would expect from a Tucson Mexican restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I really wanted this place to be good because it is so close to home but while the food was above average it was severely overpriced and the beer selection wasn't good.    Let me first say that the interior is sparse and has very little atmosphere (just a glassed-in strip mall space with parking lot views in every direction).  I generally don't start a review with a description of the build-out but lets just say that it is certainly not a place where you would expect to pay $16.50 for a burger and fries (much less $55.00 for the filet mignon that is also on the menu) and $7.00 for a Sun King Cream Ale (Sun King and FSB Preachers Daughter were the only local craft beers on the beer menu - Everything else were macro brews).  I suppose the prices are just slightly higher than what you would find at Bru Burger but the atmosphere and beer selection are well below what I expect at that price level.    It was cold and windy outside when I dined there and there was nothing between the entrance and the seating to block the cold air from reaching the tables.  Again, probably acceptable in a cheap pub but who wants to deal with that when paying these prices?    As for the food, I had a pork tenderloin and fries.  Both were above average which is why I didn't leave a 1-star review.  The pork was not your typical paper thin offering and was fairly tender.  The fries were thin and crispy although 30% of them were less than an inch long (again, I don't expect fries to be this way when paying $4.50).    Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place and will be unlikely to return.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I have been looking forward to trying this place since I saw them moving in. After some online research, I had decided that my burger-loving self would find something to love in Burger's Priest. My boyfriend and I have been waiting a few months for the newness of the place to wear off, and finally got to try it a few days ago.  The location itself is unfortunate. Parking in that particular parking lot is an excersise in frustration. After finally finding a spot, we hiked across the lot to the doors. It was not busy at all. In fact, it was pretty much all ours... At 6:30 pm on a Thursday? That's not a good sign. Oh well, we counted ourselves lucky and headed up to order. Boyfriend went for the High Priest, which appears to be their answer to the Big Mac. Two all beef patties, lettuce, cheese, special sauce... You know the drill. It was not bad. It was also not spectacular. The patties were very good quality, that was obvious. However, some seasoning or flavour would be appreciated. The buns were exact replicas of the Safeway brand hamburger buns I currently have on my kitchen counter. So, not exactly mind blowing. Lettuce was fresh, and otherwise unnoticeable. And the special sauce... Just wasn't special. Boyfriend claimed that he would choose McDonalds' special sauce over theirs. Yikes. All together, the burger was just bland.  I chose the Magnum. I have enjoyed a blue cheese burger at other places, and had a craving to satisy. I made a mistake. The blue cheese they have chosen was not my favourite, and was the only thing I could taste in the burger. It is a very strong flavour, so I understand to a point. However, if the burger itself had any flavour, I think this wouldn't have been such a problem. Once again the good quality patty with little to no seasoning was an issue. The tomato was very good when I tasted it on its own. It tasted like a tomato, which is something of a novelty at burger joints these days. The bacon was perfectly cooked, and would have been a highlight on its own. The bun was merely a vehicle for the meat. All in all, a disappointing experience.  The fries were uneventful. We did not try the milkshakes, and I'm told that was a mistake. We will be heading back another time, as we could both see potential there. My boyfriend plans to try the Vatican City, and I aim my sites on a milkshake, and anything without blue cheese. Until then, we are both left with the impression that for that amount of money, there are better places in Edmonton to enjoy a burger.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"My very first experience at La Locanda del Ghiottone was on a first date, almost a year ago.  The guy I went out with had dined there several times and the owner and staff welcomed him with open arms.  In fact, they showed us to the ""engagement table,"" where they claimed many first dates occurred in which the couple later got engaged.  Mmm-hmm.  Probably one of the more awkward moments of the date...  Luckily, the food (and wine that I was now guzzling at warp-speed) made up for any weirdness.  My date asked if I liked mushrooms, and when I said no, he insisted on ordering the mushroom appetizer anyway and promised I would like it.  Ooohkay.    I had to hand it to the guy, the ""crepe con funghi"" was good.  Points.  He also recommended the homemade gnocchi, which I believe is a special and made from cheese instead of potatoes.  Of course, being the stubborn girl that I am, I went for the ravioli instead.  Which were good, but not as good as the gnocchi, which I stole from my dining companion's plate at every opportunity.      The tiramisu that was given to us ""on the house"" was to-die.    There was a love connection made that night, only it wasn't with my date.  But I will be forever grateful to him for introducing me to this charming little Italian BYO.

"I came here with a friend for brunch. Except the brunch menu had 3 items on it instead of a whole brunch menu page like on the website. I think that's one of the main reasons I can't give the restaurant a great rating because it makes me mad when their menu in person does not match the menu online at all and they are completely different. Instead of potato hash like on the website menu the 1 breakfast dish came with tator tots which I thought was just a sad and cheap replacement for potato hash. Instead I got a lunch. I got the goat cheese salad. The fried goat cheese was delicious and it came with a huge chunk. The pecans were just alright. I would have liked more of a sweet spiced candied pecan on the salad but they were pretty spicy. I think there were way too many pecans and cranberries on the salad. It looks like they dumped a bag of craisins on it. The dressing was supposed to be an orange tarragon dressing and I figured it would be more sweet from the ""orange"". It looked like it had spices in it but it honestly just tasted like garlic. I did not taste any orange. Overall, it was alright but I probably won't go back. The manager seemed nice and came around to check up on everyone. The staff is attentive and polite.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"If you ask a cop on Bourbon Street where to eat after 11pm most will tell you to come here. Why? That's a great question. Of the few Cajun places that remain open late this is the best, several different cops told us. (Or they are getting free food from this particular location and shuffle customers in.) What did seem odd is most of the handful we polled (and we asked as sober folks) mentioned we should try Oceana or Olde NOLA Cookery, two places that are open late and also by the same owner.   Regardless, this place is worth a late night bite. It's better priced that some nearby competitors and while the food isn't amazing, it's at par with chains you've likely been to like Copelands and Pappadeaux. This isn't the kind of place that's a destination restaurant, like many others in NOLA. Meanwhile, it sure beats all the pizza by slice joints that surround it. The reality, come here for Cajun after 10pm when the competition is closed and you have no other choice. That's when it's best. And, that late at night you'll be content with the food and the service which is far better than like competitors nearby (we aren't referring to the high end spots).   I've eaten here a few times and everything is a strong average, but don't expect great sides. The veggies taste like they are made in the microwave and the collard greens definitely stemmed from a can. We've had the blackened redfish here a few times (it's much cheaper than at competitors) but often overcooked. Here's the blunt version. If you're from the Great Lakes, Northeast, or Northwest, you'll rave about this place. Meanwhile, if you live anywhere in the South, you'll agree, it's average.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"First time ever to Fatburger. My wife and I was looking forward to having a thick burger for lunch, and what an appropriate place with the name ""Fatburger"", right? Wrong! I ordered the extra large burger for my wife and myself too, and my daughter wanted the chicken strips kids meal. At the register there is a small little tablet computer that you can sign up your cell number, and you get an order of French fries for free, which I signed up. After our order, it came out to around $25 for the three of us. When our food arrived to our table, my daughter got 3 small chicken strips, no meal. My wife and I looked at our burgers, they were past well done but not burnt. However, they were as thin as cardboard and inside these thick burger buns. The condiments were on there correctly, but overall we were very disappointed. In addition, we didn't get our free fries, but we didn't ask for them either because the fries were almost burnt. I think the biggest problem was that there were only two people running the place. The cook at the grill who also delivered the food to the dining room, and the cashier who was running the front counter, drive-thru, and answering the telephone at the same time. I feel with the lack of help, his also hindered the quality and service that this restaurant should've had.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I was born and raised in Alton and during high school, Tony's was the 'go to' place for the greatest pizza ever.   I don't live in Alton now and just visit a couple times a year.  Last weekend, 6 of us went to Tony's for dinner in the bar.  My 'local' friends, tried to suggest other places, but I was determined to go.  Since it was Sunday, the restaurant had a great pasta special--salad, pasta and glass of wine for $10.  The ladies in our group got the special.  The guys--one ordered a pizza, another wanted the portobello mushroom sandwich, and the other guy got a sandwich as well.  One of the guys also ordered a beer--from the list located on the wall.  The waitress comes back and first tells one guy- they are out of mushrooms, so he ordered another sandwich, the next guy was told they were out of the beer he ordered, and finally, the guy who ordered pizza was told, they were out of hamburger, so they could not make him the pizza with that topping!

"My husband and I were recommended to stop in here for breakfast by our Air BnB host when we were staying down the street. We arrived on a Saturday morning around 10 or 10:30 and the line was practically out the door. After ordering, we were able to find a table inside. Your food is brought out to you according to your table number. Service both in that aspect and at the counter was friendly. The kitchen made an error on my husband's breakfast sandwich (left off turkey bacon) and they were quick to apologize and correct it. Coffee available that day was in medium and dark roast. I had a medium roast which was very good. They have a variety of juices and teas for grab and go too. Lots of pastries, cookies, etc. if you are looking for a sweet treat.  Both my husband and I did a ""BYO breakfast sandwich"". I chose: sourdough toast, egg, turkey andouille sausage, gouda, cooked spinach, and cooked tomato. I appreciated I was offered the option of cooked because 1. I didn't even think about it and 2. I prefer cooked to raw anyways. The breakfast sandwich was very large and filling. The bread was nicely toasted, the turkey sausage was well-flavored and had a spicy kick, the gouda perfectly melted, and the spinach and tomato were both seasoned well. The egg was fried well too. My husband chose rye toast, turkey bacon, mozzarella, and fried egg. He enjoyed his sandwich and found it to be filling too.  I'm glad our Air BnB host recommended coming here because we had a great experience-quick service, inexpensive yet quality food, and a hearty enough breakfast that we were good to go until dinner. I definitely noticed a lot of students lingering with laptops so I imagine this place can get even more packed once the universities in the area are back in full swing.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

We were packed in like sardines. No need to dress up, bedroom slippers and hoodies are not a problem I ordered the wedge for a starter, I have had better at less expensive places, the blue cheese was just blah and scant bacon. It took 20 minutes for a water refill. I ordered a filet mignon, medium well, I know sacrilegious, but I like my beef cooked. It came out rare and charred on top.  I was surprised-this is a steakhouse, they should know how to cook a steak. I sent it back, and it came back rare again now burnt on top, even the waiter was surprised. I told them to forget it, I didnt want to see the piece of leather they would bring back trying to cook this poor piece of meat.  I usually give the kitchen two tries to make it right then I move on. So only sides for me. My husband enjoyed his steak, but thought that it was a little fatty. When he got the bill, he realized it was because he was given a bone in ribeye, not the bone in NY strip he had ordered. Back to my sides. The brussel sprouts were overcooked (boiled and not grilled, roasted or sauteed, btw) and the potatoes burnt, so definitely not a good dinner. Just OK is not OK especially at these prices.

The chicken was moist and the bleu cheese coleslaw was great! We also had a pink squeeze and an orange blossom to drink.

The in house bakery is also a nice touch and very appealing.  But, alas, we are there to eat.  It was this area - food- where my smile disappeared.  In short: It was bad.  A simple bacon and eggs dish.  Can't go wrong there, right?    Wrong.   Eggs were partially burnt- partially runny.  Not sure how that happened.  Potatoes - blah.  Bacon- cold.   Full disclosure:  it was very busy so perhaps the kitchen was having a poor day.  It took quite awhile to get the food so sending it back wasn't a practical option.

"If you are looking for authentic Mexican cuisine served in a clean, relatively large restaurant right on Phoenixville's ""restaurant row"", look no further.  Owned and operated by a young couple who genuinely want you to enjoy your dining experience, despite the occasional language barrier.  If you are looking for Taco Bell type cuisine as was one lunch time diner placing a takeout order, you will be ""disappointed"" at the lack of lettuce and sour cream on your tacos al a Taco Hell.  If however, you want the genuine article and crave the pinapple and spices from an Al Pastor or the slow simmered pork shoulder in the Carnitas or the spice laced Chorizo, served on double corn tortillas warmed on a flattop just before serving, then you are in the right location.  The chorizo was soooo good that I could have eaten a big bowl of it. In fact, I asked them if they would be willing to serve me something off the menu at a future visit - Chorizo and over easy eggs and they were only too happy to oblige with a big smile.

"We found this restaurant as we were looking for another cafe. Boy, I'm glad we found this one.  I had the chorizo and sweet potato hash -- wonderful. Others in the party had stuffed french toast, poached florentine, and basic pancakes. Since we all stopped talking at the same time and started making ""yum"" noises, we shared. All tasted good.

"I stopped in for lunch for the first time today and tried their ""Spider Man Roll"". I had tried the Sushi House's (located right across the street) ""Spider Roll"" and was very fond of it and thought this would be a good way to compare the two. Now, the Sushi House charges $8.95 for theirs and here at Asian Cuisine it's $10.50 so.... basically $1.50 more. Well... let me tell you...  for that extra buck and a half I was quite happy as not only was the roll considerably larger (I'd say about 25%) it was even better. That is to say, I'd rate the Sushi House's version as ""good"" and Asian Cuisine's as ""great""! I know you can't fully rate a restaurant on one item but coming from a guy who really doesn't do much sushi (can't do the raw traditional stuff), but I wanted to pass on a review of some kind. I will say that as far as atmosphere, the Sushi House wins out as this is a smaller place that clearly caters more to the carryout crowd. That's not to say there's anything wrong here it just smaller and has less decor. I found the restaurant to be very clean and the employees to be friendly, attentive, and polite. I'll certainly be back to try some of the Chinese selections and will update my review then if needed. I guess the only real criticism is that I think they may need to have their kitchen/grill  ventilator system either checked or increased in capacity as there was (at times) some very strong smokey odors. So.... if your a big fan of the softshell crab rolls (Spider Roll, Spider Man Roll, or whatever you call them) THIS place's version is AWESOME!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I had heard great things about this place was so, was pretty excited about the Eggs Benedict. The eggs came out  pretty much hard-boiled!  This may sound nit-picky to some, but eggs hard-boiled on English muffins is simply a completely different dish. And one I definitely would not have ordered if the waitress had given me the heads up ahead of time. I see a few some previous reviewers who have had this problem, so it must be a continual problem.   My friend had the Kitchen Sink, and it was simply one of the tastiest breakfast dishes I've had yet. Which is saying something. Honestly could have done without the biscuit, but everything else coated in that delicious gravy was heavenly. Our sides of bacon and scrapple were also great- the bacon was thickly cut, savory, smoky, with a slightly charred taste; the scrapple had a thin, toasted outside, but in the inside was warm and soft-something I haven't experienced before with scrapple. Amazing.   Poached eggs are a standard, and if the 24 hour diner down the street from me can get them right at 2am, it's pretty shameful that Green Eggs Cafe cannot during the regular brunch hour.   If I hadn't experienced that extremely disappointing order myself, I may have given this place a 5.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Its their opening night and can't really fault them for having a learning curve and kinks. All is forgiven on that front. The food has great flavor. However the menu is limited and the portion sizes are not what you pay for. Let's start of with the 3 combo my sweet cheeks ordered. The taco was VERY small not even street taco size and the enchilada was street taco size but folded like a taco (not a good bang for you buck) again flavor was good. I had the shrimp, chicken and steak fajitas. The chicken ratio was way more than the beef and shrimp, so I kinda feel shorted. I do hope they make some changes on a few things like the size of the tacos and enchiladas. Not too bad though.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I scream you scream we all scream for ice cream! It is Friday and in my world, that means treat yo-self. Rolled ice cream has really blown up over the past couple of years. Originating in Thailand, rolled ice cream rolled it's way over to the United States. The first established rolled ice cream shop in the United States was located in New York. Thankfully with much achievement and high demand, ICE NY opened a shop in Philadelphia and several other locations. I just had to check it out!  Step 1: Pick your ice cream flavor & your toppings.  Flavor:  Thai I-CE Tea Banana Pudding Chocorilla Cookie Spree Mango Sticky Rice Matcha Mania Strawberry Chee-se Cake To-Taro Ca-Ti Coconut Black Sesame OR CREATE YOUR OWN!  Toppings:  Candy Cookie Brownie Fruit Cheesecake Marshmellow Pocky and more toppings...and a bunch of sauces!  Step 2: POUR POUR POUR, SMASH SMASH SMASH  Watch staff pour the ice cream mix onto a cold metal place. Staff use metal paddles to quickly break up toppings you ordered to mix into your ice cream. This is the fun part!  Step 3: The final product.  If you could not tell already, I ordered the Cookie Spree ice cream. . . and I am SO happy with my choice. It was incredibly delicious with all the ooeey gooey brownie, oreo, and chocolate sauce. This was by far the best-rolled ice cream I have had in Philadelphia. I have been to several other places in the area, but what makes ICE NY PHILLY different is that their ice cream is very rich and creamy. The ice cream had a thicker consistency which really made it stand out. I can also say I was stuffed after eating this treat.  Staff was very welcoming when I first walked in. They were super helpful especially with this being my first time at ICE NY PHILLY. They were able to give recommendations and state which rolled ice cream cups were their best sellers. It was fun watching them make my ice cream treat and getting to know the staff. Not only does ICE NY PHILLY have rolled ice cream cups, but they also make rolled ice cream sandwiches. An ice cream sandwich is definitely something I would like to try next time. I wish it was acceptable to go back again tomorrow for another ice cream treat, but I will most certainly be back in the near future to cure my next craving at ICE NY PHILLY.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Yowza. We met some friends for dinner, and this was their pick. Lolita is a very intimate space. The tables are close together and people sometimes have to squeeze behind you. But that said, it manages to be close quarters without feeling like you don't have your private space and you can't talk with your tablemates. It's an odd feat of restaurant engineering but it works. We had reservations (would highly recommend). So we were able to walk in and be seated immediately even on a busy night.  This is upscale Mexican and everything we had was delicious. We got the traditional guacamole to start, which was delicious and creamy and came with the most delicous basket of not only ""regular"" chips but also plantain chips and chips that very much reminded me of Terra Chips. Super yummy. We also got the toro tartare appetizer, which was served on more of those little chips and was absolutely delicious.  Entree-wise, I got the chicken enchiladas, which were very good and way too much food for even me to eat. But I did have ordering envy. My husband got the carne asada, which turned out to be an absolutely spot on perfectly cooked mid-rare filet with a bunch of other stuff. It was melt in your mouth perfection.  We also got a number of beverages. My husband seemed to enjoy the tamarind special cocktail and I was quite content with the beer menu. Our server was friendly and proficient. It was a really lovely meal from start to finish. Would highly recommend.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

Chicken tacos were flavorless, dry tacos. His burrito was pretty flavorless and he said burnt too. I hate wasting food, I never leave it behind.

"No Remedy for this Doomed Restaurant!  Il Remedio opened at the site of the former Rx on 45th & Spruce.  So much going for the place; so little coming out.  It's hard to fail in this neighborhood:  Penn students tend to flock toward novelty; the regular residents like to support neighborhood businesses; and there's quite some foot traffic.  So all a new restaurant has to do is provide reasonable food at  reasonable prices with vaguely competent service, right?  Wrong.  Il Remedio gets it wrong from the beginning, and there was literally nothing it did to remedy (ha!) itself or to suggest it cares to do so throughout one incomprehensibly bad meal.    Let's start with the decor:  white tablecloths in a neighborhood restaurant--  with ill-cut curtains that sort of crunch over at the bottom of the windowseats-- fine if you're going for the grungy down-market dorm look, but somehow the two just create grotesquely contradictory curb appeal (""we want to be fancy [tablecloths] but we're lazy and sloppy and couldn't get our curtains properly sized at Ikea"").  But who goes for the drapery:  let's get to the food.  I brought 7 friends in on a recent Tuesday.  We had plenty of dining options:  I dragged them here to support my neighborhood.  We ordered all the items on the appetizer list and were uniformly disappointed.  Cockles w/sausages sound great if they had something other than shells; the sausage in that dish seemed like it could learn a thing or two from Hebrew National (you know, taste, texture, complexity).  The radish salad had a few industrial looking pieces of white something and we're still debating if it was cheese, filler, or what.  The scallops with beans and ""bacon foam"" would have been nice if someone had bothered to add beans and to drop the foam (a few driblets).  And the ""greens"" on the dishes had that same industrially grown and processed feel-- heck, Trader J's might provide better produce (and no, that's NOT a compliment).  The housemade pasta was what I was looking for and it arrived lumpy, with the linguini actually angel hair. When the error was pointed out to the  waitress, she first berated the cook (""I told him to put linguini!"") then came back and insisted that their ""house made"" linguini actually resembled that angel hair on the plate.  Our party dissed the risotto as well, and the pork on the menu (or was it lamb?) was tough and disappointing.   But wait, there's dessert!  Aah:  lumps of more industrially prepared and cut gelatin appeared (""berry terrine"").  The wafer had been sitting in the cream so long it was a soggy fan; the cheese platter (""we don't know the cheeses since we buy them the day of serving"" informed our helpfully non-compos waitress)-- well, it was more of the industrial stuff that again TJ's could do better.  The profiteroles looked like they came out of a plastic can and did not  taste much better.  All the growing pains of a recently-opened restaurant, you say?  Maybe.  But in this very forgiving neighborhood, a lot might be overlooked for a competent, intelligent waitstaff.  Our party was one of 2 in the restaurant that evening, and our incompetent, simple-minded, and inept waitress seemed ignorant of every single aspect of her job.  At one point, we actually had to phone the restaurant to get her attention (""sorry, you're missing half our order, and could we please have that corkscrew you promised about 40 minutes ago."")  So, friends, support your neighborhood.  Eat at Honest Tom's down the street for a fraction of the price, or head to Kanella (10th & Spruce) owned by a W. Philly resident for superlative food and service.  But caveat emptor on this one:  there's simply no remedy for the horrors you'll find at Il Remedio!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I hate to admit it... I went here with the hopes that this place would be better than the reviews.  Unfortunately I agree with most people, just kind of a let down of a restaurant!  The atmosphere was amazing!!!  The food was disappointing...  No flavor, and tiny portions.  I took peoples advice and steered clear of the salsa bar and went for the yellow queso to start.  It was very bland but I did like the chips.  I got their version of a pizza with the pineapple pork.  It sounded delicious but was very bland!  I soaked it in cholula and salt and ate it, haha.  My boyfriend got the tamales.  It was a very small portion and he told me it was mostly dough.  They don't put any sort of sides on the plate.  Normally when you go to a mexican restaurant you get a side of rice, beans, lettuce, pico, sour cream, and sometimes guac.  There was nothing like that on either of our plates.  Also there was no salt and pepper on the table, I had to ask for salt and cholula.

"First, this place looks like the a scene from ""Book of Life"" on Dia de also Muertos! I thought it was cool, but our kids were almost terrified. The chairs were nice, but far from comfortable.   Our service left a lot to be desired. It wasn't the fault of our sever. She was new and not ready to be on her own. The fact that a manager let her take tables says a lot about their training program! She was unable to answer simple questions about the menu and had to double back to the kitchen for the answer. I guess that's better than being wrong in a guess. After our food came we never saw her again. No refills of our drinks, which was awful. When my wife finally did get a refill, it was clearly not the diet soda she ordered. I know because I drank it when I ran out of tea. Later, we asked for a box and the check, got the box. After another few minutes I had to ask the hostess for the check.   The food was mediocre. One expects chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant. Here, they charge for it. We got the Guacamole and it was pretty good. My wife had the chimichanga. She liked it but thought it was small and a little over fried. When we asked about the kids nachos, we were told plain cheese. We assumed sauce, but it was actually Monterrey Jack baked onto the chips. One of two kids approved. I had a Baja fish taco, old school and a margarita steak taco. The last one was my least favorite. No beans and rice, just tacos.   We were glad not to have driven far to try it, it would have disappointed.

When we took it inside to let them know there was one nice girl, she went to fix it, then a rude manager comes up and says ""can i help you?"" With a bad attitude and when we say someone is already Helping is she asks US where her employee is, and asks US why the employee never talked to her?? How would we or why would we even know that??

I enjoyed the sandwich and it hit the spot. The service was very friendly.  The downside is their location. It is a bit awkward to get into if you are going southbound on Grant. And also can be a bit tough to turn back southbound from the parking lot. The parking is a bit awkward, too, as there are no spaces in front of any of the businesses here due to the shape of the lot, which is rectangular next to the river. But it isn't a big deal.

I liked that they let me get a fruit cup instead of potatoes and there was a good mix (berries and pineapple), but the fruit was past it's prime. My boyfriend got the classic Benedict with hash browns. He decided the latter wasn't worth the calories and didn't eat it. He was also disappointed by his Benedict.   We also got a cinnamon roll.

"Meh.... I really wanted to love this place.  A great refurbished of the old restaurant. Open space, full bar, friendly service, happy Sundays with bargain drinks and apps. Sadly they didn't deliver on the food. I would venture to say the food is too diverse and eclectic. Bao buns alongside spaghetti and meatballs? Odd mix.  The apps were the stars here- they do these well. Good flavor, mozzarella wedges and fried green tomatoes were crisp and flavorful. Served with aioli.  Our meals were flat iron steak and grilled lobster. The steak was cooked well, but lacking seasoning. The lobster was....underwhelming, stuffed (not grilled or broiled) with Something of a breadcrumb-crab mix--I left both the grey-edged lobster and the stuffing sadly my plate.  The bao pork belly buns, Asian style were ok, on the sweet side, with the buns being too thick and heavy. The pork belly was lost in the bun.  Come here for the nice staff, full bar and apps.  I will still hope",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Amazing food!  Went here with my parents for the first time this past sunday night.  Interior is lovely and cozy, I especially liked the throw cushions.  I had the green curry with seafood, and it was delicious, flavorful, with just the right amount of spice.  My eyes were watering a little, but not too overpowering, and they can make it spicier on request.  And enough for a doggie bag for lunch tomorrow.  Service was good, our server was quite knowledgeable, and another woman (server?  manager?) asked us about our food and experience on the way out, making sure we had a good dinner.  Can't believe I've never been here before since I live right up the street and love thai food... will definitely be back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"We just tried this place for dinner based on a little write-up in the St. Pete Times.  It needs work in several respects.  First, even though they weren't full, nobody greeted us at the door for a good 2-3 minutes.  Our waitress was polite, but took forever to get us drinks.  Then, as we noticed tables getting bread, we asked if it was complimentary and she said yes, but we needed to ask for it!  Food was just so-so--my husband's lasagna was lukewarm, and my chicken saltimbocca wasn't anything special.  Bill had a $2 upcharge for linguine that I wasn't aware of--another reviewer informed me that this did appear on the menu, but the print was so tiny that my husband and I had a hard time reading it!  And I did not ask for the linguine--the waitress asked which pasta I wanted, and under those circumstances, I would expect her to have mentioned that the homemade pasta options cost extra.  Red wine was also served Florida room temperature, where no wine should ever be served!  Unfortunately, there aren't many great options for family-style Italian food in St. Pete, and I can't say this restaurant helps alleviate that problem.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I'm not one to write reviews, but I felt this one is warranted. I haven't been to this location in over a year, and decided to stop in today. I used to LOVE this place... sang its praises to friends and family, but man has it gone downhill. Off day maybe? Who knows. I ordered two shrimp tacos grilled no cilantro, because they weren't doing fried for the time being. (Federale Taco Grilled Tiger Shrimp and Bacon, tossed in Texican BBQ Sauce, topped with Spicy Slaw, Chipotle BBQ Sauce, Toasted Sesame Seeds and Cilantro) the photo speaks for itself...They were drenched in sauce with very little topping other than the shrimp. SO disappointed. Sad to say I won't be going back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"ALERT!!!!! THEE most disgusting food I've ever had in my life!!!!   I ordered from them because they were the only Chinese restaurant that delivered to my hotel, I had the combination fried rice and shrimp egg rolls. The fried rice wasn't fried at all, and it looked a lot like Uncle Ben's rice that you get from the grocery store. The egg rolls were barely fried as well. The meat wasn't cooked thoroughly, if it was real chicken and beef at all. And the food had a weird smell to it. I wouldn't recommend anyone eating at this establishment in the future, in fact they need to fucking shut this place down.

"I have been to Bar Louie a couple of times and had never been blown away. That being said, what they do they do very well. This is a great spot for the after work crowd to grab a quick, and cheap drink. It's a great spot to meet up and catch games. And they have great Happy Hour and Daily specials.   We were there on a Tuesday to catch the USA v. Belgium World Cup match up and the specials for that day consisted of a list of half price apps, $3.25 drafts (312 for $3.25?!! Yes, please!) and dollar burgers.   We had the hummus plate and calamari to share and burgers all around and a side of tots. The calamari was pretty bad. It tasted like it had been frozen and it was chewy. We ended up not finishing it. The Hummus plate was awesome. The burgers. . . I guess I will just say, they are dollar burgers and you get what you pay for. I will reserve my review of their burgers for a day when I order a normal one off the menu. The tots were perfect.  Overall, I would definitely go back for the drink specials, the atmosphere for games and late night. Not so much the food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This place is a solid Asian Fusion place, and I was pleasantly surprised that all the dishes were delicious, no matter the original cuisine.  The sushi was fresh, the pad thai was the perfect blend of savory and sweet, and the taro spring rolls are the perfect way to end your meal.  I know that many Penn students have an aversion to this place, but I never understood why.  If it's only because the food is more expensive than other restaurants, then I think that is unfair.  While somewhat pricy, I think it is still one of the cheaper Starr restaurants and offers very tasty options throughout the menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Our large party of 20 people celebrated a special birthday at Sullivan's and was greatly disappointed.  We were held hostage for a few hours after our food and drink came an hour and half from ordering (the restaurant wasn't busy), dessert (it was a party after all) came so late people ended up getting theirs to go (the restaurant put ice cream in a to go box - who does that?).  3 hours into it people just wanted their checks to go home (our reservation was at 6pm and by this point it was 9pm)...It took over an hour to get our checks sorted out (though they sat us and took our order according to our separate checks). At 10pm they ended up lining us up in our private room and ""checking us out"" couple by couple because they couldn't get anyone's bill correct.  Finally around 10:30pm the last couple was able to leave.  Worst service experience ever!  I gave it 2 stars because everyone loved their food (or just starving by the time they got it).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Had a wonderful experience at Josephine the other night. The interior of the restaurant had a modern yet intimate feel. Perfect for date night! The cuisine was upscale Southern with a fine dining feel and service was on par with the quality of the food. We were well taken care of by our server who answered all questions, provided prompt and knowledgeable service, and gave great recommendations! The entire staff was friendly even as we closed down the restaurant.  Food was incredible here. We enjoyed a round of craft cocktails with our appetizers of duck fat hash browns with trout roe and the cheese board (pictures included). We then split the lamb bolognese, the swordfish with potato salad, and the Brussels sprouts. Our server had the dishes individually plated for us, which I always appreciate when sharing food. Everything was cooked beautifully and we would've licked the plates clean if we could have!! Josephine was a great choice--highly recommend.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"I'm not one to watch the chef shows so celebrity chefs don't do me. That said, the food was creative and cutting edge. We had the  four course tasting menu. The dishes have many flavors that reveal themselves to you one at a time which is fun. Small portions, but enough food. I had a wonderful glass of Argentinian wine which was fun. My only disappointment is that they only change the four course menu seasonally so no real incentive to go back again until next season unless I ante up for the six course menu which is just a little too pricey with a kid in college.  Wonderful service. Really top notch which is becoming more and more rare these days.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I'm from Chicago and my wife was kind enough to bring me one of your deep dish pizzas. All I'll say is you all need to take a trip to the Windy City and see how the real thing is made.  All of that seasoning in your crust was overwhelming, the meatball needs to be chunks not ground and there's way too much seasoning on the top of the tomatoes sauce.

"I really love this place. The burritos are cheaper AND fresher than Qdoba, and they even have a ""mini"" size for just $4.99 if the regular size proves too overwhelming (or you just have problems with self-control.)  My favorite burrito is the California chicken -- rice, salsa, chicken, guac, cucumbers, tomatoes, green peppers and sour cream -- although I've tried pretty much the entire menu, and have yet to be disappointed. The chicken and cheese is great if you're not big on rice...and the turkey burger burrito is basically a burger, served tex-mex style. Mmmm. There's also a substantial veggie menu, with treats like the spicy Middle eastern burrito, complete with jalepeno hummus and salsa negra. yum!  The decor is simple and a little funky...a small counter with bar stools, smattering of booths in the back, colorful collages on the wall and a small TV mounted on the wall. I'll walk all the way from Old City to grab lunch in this joint -- a testament to its affordability and deliciousness.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Ate here recently and split the porterhouse, very good. Sweet potato nice and soft but slight after taste-I eat organic ones at home. Mushrooms on the steak were phenomenal. Caesar still great-I will ask for a touch less dressing but really like it. Calamari melts in the mouth with a creamy sauce-may ask if they can do marinate next time. I asked about an organic wine and I am hoping they will order some. I drink Frey but others are fine. These are healthier and they don't make my cheeks hurt due to the added nitrates. It is so pleasant inside; simply gorgeous. They accommodated us Seven people with request to be outside but inside if it rained. It was a weeknight but still fairly full. Dessert was a giant chocolate covered light creamy cheese cake-amazing. This has mostly choices for steak but can also get crab cakes, fish, oysters (lots of people eating them). They have veal parm-not sure if they will do a chicken parm. They have gourmet salads with interesting dressings. Service was perfect; the waitress was pleasant and fantastic. She was always available when we needed anything. Water was filled. Everything was perfect. They have valet only which is nice and free but can park off street if there are places. I don't recall any music but that would be nice softly I the back ground. I just love this place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

But when we were sat it felt like our server was rushing us and was eager to get away. Our waters sat empty for a minute and I had to ask to get them refilled. What really bothered me though was seeing a busser repeatedly pick up glasses with her hands in the glass, running around so much I highly doubt hands were washed afterwards. And then on top of that while glancing in the kitchen I noticed none of the kitchen staff were correctly wearing their masks each time I would see them. The syrup container was coated in syrup leading me to think that also was not being washed.

"I did not add any pictures to this review as I think you would get more of the same.   The food here is of high quality but not particularly inventive.   Yes, it is a chain.  Go for the dry aged steak.  There are big upcharges on the typical high margin items - wine, dessert, drinks, etc - but the quality of the ingredients here was top shelf.  Appetizers Tuna tartare - small cubes of sushi grade tuna stacked over cucumber and avocado.   Generous portion for one, better for two.   Dabs of sriracha and a mango puree also came with the dish along with matzo type crackers.   4 stars.  Everything just didn't come together here.  Lobster and crab cakes - two small cakes with a small side of corn salad.  Good portion for one. Creamy sauce to go with it but not exciting. 3 stars.   OK but would not order again.  Bread basket - amazing.   Warm onion rolls, onion pumpernickel, and at least two other breads.   5 stars  Entrees: All steaks and all cooked perfectly and these entrees were in the $50 range, each. Dry aged Porterhouse - great 5 stars.  Huge portion for even a very hungry person Filet with butter poached lobster tails.   Not sure that these were Maine lobsters based on the size.   Filet was great.  4 stars overall Porcini dry aged strip steak with balsamic vinegar - excellent and a huge portion. 5 stars  We ordered two sides.  Plenty for three.   Nothing exciting here either.  Dessert - we shared a cocoanut custard pie. Graham cracker crust with not much custard and lots of whipped cream with a large, flat, coconut ""cookie"".   Without the cookie, and no written knowledge of the flavor, you would be hard pressed to identify it as coconut custard. 3 stars.   Would not order this again.  We ordered a bottle of wine and paid a hefty price for a 90 point Malbec.   We finished the bottle but I am sure the house made $50 on this alone.  This is not the place for the cheap or on a budget.   You might get a better deal at lunch.    There are many service people here.   It was attentive but condescending at times.   For example we asked for clarification about the foie gras creme brûlée.   ""Have you ever had it?""  Yes, we have, many times.   ""Have you ever had flan?""  Yes, we have, many times.   Not sure how a nice way would be to ask that without saying first that we had both.  Free valet parking is available.     Make a reservation.   I was able to get one before six the night before but everything else was locked up tight with more folks waiting.  It is very dark inside with no windows in the main dining area and the background music is loud for conversation with the older set.  That having been said, it was mostly an older crowd.     The dress was labeled as ""dressy"" on Yelp so the guys went with a collared shirt, no jeans, and a tie.   Not so for others there.  Many polo shirts and a couple of Hawaiian shirts as well.   So much for dressy.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"NoLibs restaurant cafe with a menu that caters equally to vegetarians, vegans, and meat-eaters with home-cookin' Southern influenced food. It's a very eclectic mix of offerings with sprinklings of nutrition-packed power foods (ie: kale, quinoa, brussel sprouts) along with some good ole fatty meat (like riblets and fried chicken).   I was very pleased with the: - Catfish Po' Boy: (deepfried seasoned catfish served on a long roll with lettuce, pickles, and remoulade) - Side Mac and Cheese: (made with 3 cheeses and multi-grain pasta). Fresh ingredients, good flavor, generous portions  Feeling 'meh' about:  - Spinach and Black Bread Salad: wish there were more grilled veggies, and wasn't really feelin' the pumpernickel toast - Ginger Soy Kale: Solid, but a pretty small portion, even for a side  - Belgian Waffle Ice Cream Sandwich: it's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants call what is a pretty standard waffle a Belgian waffle- these were definitely regular waffles, except may be a little mealier in texture. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the enormous scoops of ""motor oil"" ice cream (coffee with caramel/coffee swirls) inside.   Our servers were super patient and helpful, and maybe it is just the NoLibs atmosphere but they just made me feel so relaxed and calm.   When it's nice out, the outdoor seating along Liberties Walk is a prime location for eating leisurely and people watching. I also love how the water glasses are huge jars. Very cute.

No smile or nothing.  Then when I went to go pick up my order at the end of the counter So I asked I wasn't sure if it was ready or not so I asked another employee another employee is this ready ""is this ready?"" and her reply was ""no that's why it's still sitting there"".   The salad bar was just basic, nothing special but not horrible. I will say, it has a decent about if toppings - proteins not included. The chicken ranchero wrap was very small, reminded me of a kids meal.   Overall, I don't anticipate going out of my way to come back.

"I had been itching to try out Lovers & Madmen for a while and finally got to scratch that itch a few days ago. I ordered a quiche with spinach, scallion, and goat cheese, as well as an iced chamomile tea. Before I went there, I looked up Lovers & Madmen's menu on its website and saw that it was $5.50 for a slice of quiche. I thought that's reasonable since other Yelpers recommend the quiche. However, it was in fact $8. I kind of felt cheated and misled by the website, but I grudgingly paid $8 to try this supposedly great quiche. Yes, it was delicious, but was it worth $8? Hell no. On top of that, the cashier/barista (she was the only one there) told me a few minutes after I paid and while the quiche was being heated that she forgot they ran out of salad. She offered potato chips instead, but I didn't want unhealthy, greasy food, so I declined. She didn't offer anything else as a replacement.  In summary, Lovers & Madmen has poor service and overpriced menu. If you're willing to pay and dismiss the poor service, then this place is for you.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"So my mom wanted R&R's pizza for Mother's Day. There were several people eating over so we decided to save time and order online. I placed the order and all that came up on the screen was ""order already processed"" which seemed off to me. I called the store to ask if they received my order and they said they had not. Ok, that happens. In speaking with them I found out the menu service on their own website- Menu Star- is no longer supported by them. We would have used Grubhub but the restaurant claims to have twice not received prior order my family placed through there. Ralph told me to reach out to the Menu Star company...who they themselves cut ties with because they don't have a customer service number. Meanwhile, in Menu Star's terms of service they say that refunds are up to the discretion of the restaurant.   A second person called back to confirm my total and I asked if my online order ever came and she said no, call the company to request a refund. Again, the staff member was very emphatic that they could do absolutely nothing for me about it. I was repeatedly asked if I understood them. It's Mother's Day and I just want to spend time with my family but instead I'm listening to how little you care if your customers are duped.

Trying to make a beer selection from the extensive list in my current state was not unlike trying to solve a Rubik's cube while intoxicated.  I decided to ask Molly, the lovely bartender that evening, for assistance.  Based on my preferences, she selected a seasonal draught with a high ABV content and tons of flavor.  I was feeling human again just in time for my company to arrive.    At this point, the tables were almost all taken, so we decided to set up at the corner of the bar, so we could still chat somewhat across from each other.  Although there were many items on the menu that sounded tempting, the fried chicken with German potato salad had my number.  I was not disappointed.  The chicken was drizzled with a spicy honey that was to-die, and the German potato salad was on another level.  Instead of bacon, it contained bits of fried chicken skin, and the salad had a tangier bite than the sweeter version I grew up eating.  My grandmom will probably beat me down with her little German fists shall she ever read this, but... Resurrection's potato salad had her recipe beat (just by a little, I promise!).    My date had a flaky turnover stuffed with duck confit, which was a special that had been on the New Year's Eve menu.  I might just lobby to get this onto their regular menu in the future.  It was excellent!    Several more beers and a number of very strong Irish coffees later, we finally called it a night.  Despite being in a section of the city that I was previously unfamiliar with, I will gladly go out of my way to visit this fine establishment time and again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"It was Sunday so the regular Thai restaurant that we attend was closed, but it was Mother's Day so we wanted to treat Mom and she wanted Thai food. We arrived at 6:30 sharp afrer making a reservation and we were immediately seated. After that we waited about 25 minutes for them to even take our order. It seemed that everyone else was getting attention but us. Another 20 minutes after we placed our order, two of the people at our party were served their food. By the time they were done eating 20 more minutes later my wife and I were served ours. The food looked and tasted good except for the fact that I ordered 2 on the spicy scale of 1 to 5 and the food they brought me out was much much hotter than a 2. It was so uncomfortably spicy that i was unable to enjoy my dinner. The waiter  even came out and asked me if it was hot enough.

"Finally Joe's New York style pizza and restaurant got the OK to open from the Largo code department. Largo has some of the strictest code rules in the area and is constantly holding up new restaurants from opening.  We've been here two times during the opening week, and another time for take-out. First time we ordered two slices of pizza and a soda for $7.00 each. It was a good deal, the pizza slices are so huge my wife couldn't finish both of them. I ordered a plain pizza and a loaded meat pizza, both had good flavor with a nice crunch on the crust.  Second time here I ordered linguine with White clam sauce. I really didn't like it, it had a very odd taste to it.  Third time we ordered takeout pizza, green pepper and onions. Got to say it was just all right, nothing special.

"This place DOES NOT OFFER Quattro Formaggi Pizza!!! Now, this is my number one concern, and I think we are not the only party who found that name completely misleading. Walking down the Mandalay Ave, I saw this place and thought of Classic Four Cheese Pizza, but that wasn't the case.  Next up, the interior. On top of being super worn, like EXTREMELY worn, every couch of theirs is begging to get vacuumed, every single table is crying to get cleaned. The hands literally stick down to it. There are tons of sand in the couches, on the floors and all over the place.  The wall between seating area and the kitchen is not all the way up; there is like a couple foot gap between it and a ceiling, that allows all the smoke and other cooking-process vapors to come thru and settle on all surfaces. Menus are nasty to touch, they are black dirty.  Service. Altough the guy serving us was nice, it felt like they were super short handed. He was taking orders at the counter, bringing the food out of the kitchen, would be no surprise if he takes part in the cooking process while in the back, he was the only person in. Beer was served open bottle covered with 0.2l plastic cup (see pic) - no comments on this.  To a little better part now, which is the pizza. Despite the selection isn't wide, the pie was made really well. We ordered Mona Lisa pizza, and its their savior from the shallowness of 1 star. It wasn't soggy, kept its crust, ingredients seemed fresh and cooked fine. Onions were tasty and I did feel the truffle oil flavor as much as needed, not overcrowded.  It probably would've been 3 stars if not their pricing. Pizza on the pic is the small-sized pie and it was $18, while the asking price for a larger one is $27. I understand, its right on the Mandalay Ave, right in the heart of the strip, but considering all abovementioned IT IS NOT WORTH THE COST.  This place isn't dangerous, but without a minor doubt, I will not recommend to come here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"A large group of us ate at Franks in hopes of having one last remarkable meal in New Orleans before heading home.  And, I must say this experience was one of the most remarkable dining experiences I've had in my life.  What we hadn't accounted for, however, is that the term remarkable can also refer to infamously miserable experiences.  A few, select facts: 1) 3 of the 6 of us ate less than 1/10 of their food 2) 1 of us thought it was ok / good (He had the muffaleta) 3) The other two ate about half of their food 4) We were charged for an item we didn't buy 5) I accidently knocked over a full glass of water and ice.  It took their team 15 minutes to clean it up 6) We were served food without silverware or napkins (also why we didn't clean up the water ourselves) 7) Too many additional problems to attempt to be comprehensive  A few quotes for the group: 1) ""I've had food poisoning that tasted better than this"" 2) ""I almost feel guilty for not cutting into each ravioli because I know they're going to serve my left-overs to the next guy [who orders ravioli]"" 3) ""Back in college, I cooked spagetti and ragu in my freshman dorm room [using a microwave] that was 10x better than this""",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I am not a West Coastie. I should start off with this to be fair. So I have heard stories of Del Taco and how it is vastly superior to Taco Bell.  I had to find out. I was pleasantly surprised. Other than a lady who was sitting in the corner booth talking to herself (at some point... I think she took her panties off in the bathroom), the atmosphere was what you expect of a fast food joint-although the parking kind of sucks. I think this location is more of a drive through oriented restaurant.  I preferred the Del Taco meal deal-$4 for a large taco, big bean burrito, fries and a drink. Crazy cheap... The taco was stuffed with to the brim with cheese, like seriously amazing fresh ground stuff-not what I expected at all. The bean burrito had actual refried beans, with whole beans in it-and a ton of cheddar too. I tried one fry-not bad at all. I should have stuffed my burrito.  I looked at the menu and saw a ""The Del Taco Turkey"" and curiosity and a bottomless stomach led me to buy it too. I sauced it up (the Hot is actually spicy-unlike even the weak Diablo at Taco Bell) and took a gigantic bite to a very flavorful, also cheesy, taco. Honestly, the ground beef and ground turkey don't have a huge flavor difference but I like the texture of the turkey more.  Overall... Del Taco isn't even in the same category as Taco Bell. No competition it's waaaaaay better.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"If I could give zero stars I would. I understand that this is in a resort and expect to pay a little bit more because of it. However, I also expect to receive exceptional service. That was not the case.   My husband and I both ordered the pork. Both with side salads, one Mac and cheese and one baked beans.   First it took 10 minutes for a server to even greet us in a half full dining room that we waited for. Then after ordering, another half hour (without a salad). When the food arrived the server didn't return until we had pushed our plates aside.   The pork was DRY dry dry. When I say this is the worst pulled pork I have ever had I am not exaggerating. It was terrible and I could have gotten better from the cold section at the gas station. Mac and cheese was OK but just good enough to choke down (I was hungry, pork inedible and no server in sight). If I could have hunted down a server I would have told them to please for the love of all things take this back.   After our $21 plates of gas station pork we got the bill. One bottle of domestic beer was $5.   Don't bother. Seriously. Do yourself a favor and just don't bother.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I was so bummed by our experience here because I had really high hopes after hearing great things!  To be fair, it's possible that we didn't order the right things (although the menu is fairly small and one-note for a sharing multiple plates type of restaurant).    Everything had the same note of salty and heavy and not much else.  At an individual plate level, I thought a simple touch of green apple or other acid could've perked up a dish.  But after five or six plates of the exact same, it was pretty clear that this is just the chef's taste.  The best dish we had was the dessert - bitter grapefruit sorbet.  It was really well balanced with bitter, sweet, and sour and provided much-needed lightness after such a fatty, heavy meal.  The worst dish was the special of the night.  It was a cassoulet with duck, lamb, and pork.  I imagined a cassoulet with a piece of duck, a piece of pork belly, and maybe a lamb sausage.  Nope!  It was a bowl of slightly undercooked white beans topped with chopped up meat.  Sometimes I worry that the special of the night is a way to use up leftovers from the restaurant.  This was definitely 100% leftovers - just bits of meat that didn't make the cut into other dishes.  On top of the food, I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere.  Service was professional (although we had one long stretch waiting with no food on the table), but it felt like everyone was too cool for me.  Not especially friendly or attentive.

I really wanted to like this place because of it's convenient location near my home but I have eaten here on four occasions and still think it's average.  IMO, one of the signs that the food is going to be good at any Mexican Restaurant is the quality of the chips and salsa when you first sit down. The chips are awful. Hard and tasteless and the salsa is something you would get our of a jar at the grocery store. The cheese enchiladas are bland and insipid. The tortillas are starchy, tasteless and boring. The chicken tacos are passable. The chalupa lacks guacamole.  I cannot elaborate on any of the specialty entrees. I tend to order the basics because most Mexican restaurants do not know how to deliver good seafood dishes (unless you are in California.)   My theory is that you must conquer the basics before you can excel at the specialties.   I give up on Salsa's. Adios Amigos!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The servers were quite friendly, just a bit ""relaxed"". They offer both ""prepared"" and DIY Korean bbq - grilling the meat yourself at the table. Prices were a tad high, for my ""California Korean Restaurant"" standards. Bibimbap (clay pot) was $12-13.

"The feel of this place was super cool and the building itself is really unique. Unfortunately, the pizza just wasn't all that I had hoped it'd be. We got a pizza off of their regular menu called the Pork & Pine as well as their special, the Nashvillian.   Both pizzas were just okay. The toppings were very sparse. We weren't disappointed with the light amount of cheese though... so I will give them kudos on that much. The pizza sauce was good, but again there just wasn't a ton of anything to merit saying the flavor was amazing or unique. We couldn't taste the ham at all on the Pork & Pine (and I honestly forgot that was a topping until my boyfriend said something about it after the meal) and their were maybe one or two tiny cuts of pineapple per slice. Even then, the pineapple was just so-so.   I really wish I could give this place a better review simply because it does have such a cool building and vibe. Sadly, I wouldn't recommend King Dough unless you are a fan of light everything... including toppings. I will say that the Yelp reservation/place holder option is awesome though.

I never had one, and the menu doesnt really tell you what the sandwich comes with, so i was hit with add ons for both their 'sharp provolone' and the famous broccoli rabe, both i suppose complement the sandwich. i guess they should have figured out a way to include these staples in their namesake sandwich without costing me another 20%! they added to the sandwich, but without them, i bet the pork could hold its own.  cost aside, it was fine, moist, flavorful, could it use a sauce? everyone loves a sauce, but it was sauceless, sad sauce face.  anyway, in closing, it was a fine sandwich and i would eat another one in a less busy time and thats that.  porked",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I could eat those things all day!  I also really enjoyed the amul cheese pizza! The cheese was unique, kind of similar to an American white cheese.

The beef lamb gyro meat was dry, had gristle, and very little flavor (It was bordering on uneatable for me and I stopped halfway through) and 2. I chose lettuce as opposed to rice or a pita and the amount of lettuce was very small. (It's lettuce - cut food costs somewhere else.)

"The food was ok, but a bit bland. We love Indian food, so we have experience with which to compare this. Here, medium spicy seems to mean bland. I will compliment them on the rice, as that is so often a weak point.  The real problem was the service. We were only the second table when we arrived, and the other was occupied by just one person. The woman server seemed nice enough, if not warm and friendly. But, the man was just rude. He doesn't even seem to know how to place dishes when they arrive; he just handed the platters/bowls to us and we had to set them down. His entire attitude was one of being irritated - by the presence of customers!  As we were leaving, he rushed up to a table of two women who arrived after we did. He snapped at them that they had to pay cash, because his card processor was down or something.  They were both startled and neither had enough cash on them. I don't know how that worked out. I'll just reiterate that this man, apparently the owner, is unpleasant. None of us at dinner - 3 of whom live nearby - will go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I'm going to be perfectly honest: I did not enjoy my meal here. However, the service was attentive and Zack devoured his pulled pork sandwich- I have no doubts that other people will love this place.   The pulled jerk chicken sandwich didn't taste like jerk chicken. It was mushy and unappetizing and served on a long roll. Looked kinda like stuffing at a Thanksgiving table spread and I could only eat a few bites. The ""coleslaw"" was really just pickled cabbage and the fries are sprinkled with bay seasoning. Maybe you're into that. I'm just letting you know, okay?   FYI: the only side offered that doesn't include a pork product is the mac and cheese.   Zack's going to reheat the other 3/4 of my sandwich for lunch tomorrow. He'll probably like it better than I did.  Note- @BlueBellyBBQ did not like this review.

"I like to go to Red Hook because they're very close and convenient for me to buy quality coffee by the pound.  The decor is nice and they feature different artists selling their work monthly.  The owner is very nice as well, and they're dog friendly.  Other times, the coffee made by the snubbish barista's has been good, but just good at a price that's a little above average.  I appreciate they serve organic items and try to be enviromentally friendly, but at a price.  The smoothies are good but I don't think they're made with fresh fruit, and for $5, I'd like fresh fruit.  I'd never order food there again.  I had a chicken basil pesto sandwich once and had food poisoning for 2 days, and then I later learn 3 of my friends have gotten food poisoning as well from their sandwiches!  Yikes!

"Ok, let's set something straight right now, a 5-star restaurant is something like The Top of the Mark in San Francisco or something like that. This is NOT a 5-star despite what ""Ronnie"" wants you to believe. Maybe ""Ronnie"" is an Idaho native and one thing's for sure, their standards are *very* low. OK about the restaurant: This place is VERY popular with the local crowd, probably because of the hibachi show (Think Benihana). I believe the joint used to be a Shakey's as can be seen carved into the original concrete. The interior, if you look closely, is all worn and beat up with massive water stains in the ceiling tiles especially over the sushi bar. (a *tiny* sushi bar) The main tepanyaki (flat grill and show) prepared food is decent and well priced during lunch. (rice and meats) The side dishes fall well below the mark. Salad is western style w/croutons, small and not very tasty. They also serve a blah onion soup, probably catering to western tastes, but not very Japanese. Prices go up by around 50% at dinner so be prepared to get socked. The sushi side of things was a huge disappointment. The owner was not there, instead his wife was doing the slicing and dicing. Here they give you low quality miso soup. Our sushi was the biggest let-down. We got very tiny, paper thin (or shoji-thin!) pieces, the kind you'd expect at the $1.00 sushi boat place. Except these cost $4.00! That could only be categorized as a rip-off in my book. The fish was OK, and they did have a tasty No. 9 Kyoto roll, (shrimp, avocado, tobiko) but that didn't make up for their stingy portions. Also, they didn't serve any tea, guess you gotta ask for it or pay for it. If you want the grill tepanyaki show, a better place to go might be Ichiban. The best sushi place in town still remains Shige's.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"My husband and I went during lunch on a Saturday. The place was small and not busy when we walked in. There was one other group of customers at the time. The service was extremely slow. There was only one waitress at the time,she was pleasant just very slow. As slow as the service was it seemed like she was waitress, cook and table busser all in one. We ordered the spring roll sampler, seafood mac and wings. The spring rolls were average at best. The seafood mac was a nice serving size, it didn't have crab as they were out of crab at the time. The seafood seasoning overpowered the dish as well. The Thai salt and pepper wings were good, they reminded me of the salt and pepper wings that I've only been able to find in San Diego, CA",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I've been here multiple times in the past. And this recent experience have put this place at the bottom of my hand drawn noodle list. I went with my boyfriend and my brother on a Saturday evening. It was early enough where it wasn't busy but late enough where there were a few others dining.  It's not bad food-wise. The broth is decent, nothing to write about. The hand-drawn noodles were bloated despite coming out so quickly. I ordered the shaved noodles which were fine.   The service was terrible. We got seated fairly quickly by a male waiter who asked us what we wanted to drink and we said water. He leaves and never bring any back. Not that big of a deal. We can ask again. But when it came to ordering we had another older female waitress get our order. As we were ordering, mid-word, stopped us to seat another group. We were astounded because we've never had someone taking my order just disappear like that. Especially as we were in the middle of a sentence. It wasn't super busy and there were other wait staff.  She comes back and continues with our order, clearly uninterested and clearly not paying attention. After we put our order in, 10 minute later, she comes back to confirm that we ordered a veggie mix shaved bowl. We didn't, we ordered a shaved beef mix bowl (which I don't recommend because despite listing beef slices included in the mix, I got 2 small slices.)  Back to the water situation, another younger waitress came by with a handful of cup asking each table if they wanted water. We grabbed the 3 we need and realized 2 of the 3 cups were dirty so we didnt drink it. And at this point, we just wanted to finish our noodles and leave this place.  TLDR: Terrible service. Food is not good enough to make up for it. Will not be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

The only thing that bothered me (but I got used to it) is this alarm that goes off every time someone enters the gas station.

"Our reservation was for Mother's Day brunch. The food was excellent - really superb. The service was also good - though limited on this occasion. Rating would have been 5 stars but I reduced it based on the ""value"" factor because I was disappointed that the $65/pp rate for the brunch also applied to our children, who clearly were not enjoying the mimosas. (I contacted the restaurant about this in advance and did not receive a response.) I also thought that the ""suggested gratuities"" of 18%-22% were a bit presumptuous and aggressive, particularly considering this was a buffet situation -- in other words, ""service"" amounted to topping off drinks and clearing plates between trips to the food line. Yes, the gratuity is a choice - and I did choose to tip generously because the two employees taking care of us were attentive and polite - but I don't like to see the expectation that tips be ~20% in a limited-service scenario. Overall, we enjoyed it and everyone in my family agreed we'd go back on another day.

We arrived at around 10:04 pm so you know what that means!!! HALF PRICE APPS!!!! Although we actually came for the crab legs we decided to indulge in some appetizers, why not? We had buffalo shrimp, fried pickles, and crab legs. The  food was fresh and you could tell was made to order. Even the price of the crab legs have went from $11.99 to $20,99 they are well worth it . You get 1lb for that price with hot melted butter. Yum some of the best crab legs I've had hands down. You can tell they are streamed and not boiled in water. Real crab leg eaters know steaming them helps to keep their integrity. The waitstaff assisted each other which showed good team work  and morale among the staff. Our particular waitress was great until she took my plate and through it away trying to clean up but I still had crab legs to eat on their. My feelings were extremely hurt. She came by and asked us how we were doing for the last time before ending hr shift and I was very transparent with her and explained my hurt for her accidentally throwing my food away. She quickly fixed the problem by requesting the chef to make a few to replace the ones she accidentally threw away. Sorry, I am a sucker for exceptional customer service. She went above and beyond without getting a manager involved . I greatly appreciated that.

Normally, I don't get too excited to try a new restaurant if they don't have more than a few vegan options, but at a meatball speciality restaurant that offers vegan meatballs, I'm not sure what more one could expect.  The patio sidewalk seating was a huge plus, as it is located on the edge of Mass Ave with a nice view of downtown. The interior of the restaurant gave off a nice ambience and was cozy and laid back.   I went with the vegan meatballs with traditional marinara and spicy cilantro sauce, with a side of grilled Brussels sprouts. Everything about this meal was absolutely delicious. The meatballs were very original and made with veggies rather than an imitation meat product. The spicy cilantro was spicy and flavorful without being uncomfortably hot.

If you charged for the regular salmon plate ... where was the rest of that plate?  To not have any way to add chicken, salmon, steak, etc to a salad ... seems your ordering systems need some updating.  Main point being - your approach toward the conversation ... immediately argumentative and defensive toward my question, rather than accomodating or compromising is a poor way to treat a customer. When I wanted the argument to end and just pay the amount, you continued to argue with me.  Run your business how you'd like.

"I've been going to this location for about a decade now and remember the days when this used to be Jillian's. It's a pretty large establishment and unfortunately for me I've never done their bowling or billiards, but perhaps one day I will and will update this review.  I stopped in on Saturday with my seven year old nephew and it was insanely crowded, which I half expected. A lot of their games are old, not in disrepair, just old and uninteresting because of it (they're mostly ten year old games, so no longer cutting edge or shiny and clean). Still, it's a decent arcade, and I enjoyed playing some racing games.   As far as the food I've never been disappointed. It's about in line with what you'd expect from a chain, greasy and fried but filling at least. Their drinks are also good, if expensive, I suggest getting a Purple People Eater to see your mouth turn blue (that's if they still have it, the last time I ordered it was over a year ago).   This place could be better than what it is, but at least it's not half bad, and it's a fun way to waste some time. Just don't go in with your expectations too high.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Stopped in at about 2:15 pm on a Tuesday afternoon. We were the only ones there until 2 ladies and 1 man came in. We opted for the bar. We ordered happy hour margaritas which were 2 for $7. Salter rim, lime, on the rocks which were more tart than sweet which is how I like them.   Ordered a chilaquiles and added chorizo for $2. He ordered three mexican street tacos = 1 chorizo, 1 carnitas &1 steak. All came with cilantro and chopped white onion. All delicious. Limes on the side. And we asked for the red hot sauce. Also very good.   The chilaquiles was loaded with chorizo. Well worth the $2 added to the tab. The chips were fresh made and were on top of a ladle of green sauce. They stated 'spicy' on the menu but to me it was not however I LOVE HOT FOOD! The eggs were perfectly cooked. The beans and rice were huge portions. I had enough for 2 more meals. Delicious! My favorite go to mexican food along side chiles relents.   We had to ask for silverware which wasn't a biggy. We also asked for extra hot sauce. Free chips and 2 salsa upon arrival. Both salsas were made in house and good but mot overly spicy.   Service was good. She checked on us several times. 2 large meals and 2 margaritas was $24. But like I said my meal was enough for 3 servings. Definitely recommend you stop in. They offer delivery as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"So I went back and tried two new different things.. I got the roast chicken lunch special which comes with a whole half a chicken and yellow rice and beans for under $6. It's a great deal! They do give you a few slices of lettuce and a slice of a tomato in your lunch special, which I guess is a wanna be salad? I would have rather had some veggies, extra rice, or nothing at all. So I guess last time I got white rice (which was SO bland) and I switched to yellow rice this time, MUCH better! Make sure you order yellow rice! I also got the garlicky fried plantains, they were super good.  Anyways, I will be back! And I plan on trying many more things.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Triumph has a nice feel to it but the service and prices made it just an average place for an evening of drinks. For a Friday night the place was pretty packed and we could t get a seat at the bar. I had the Honey Blonde which tasted slightly better than a Miller Light and cost twice as much. My boyfriend tried their Winter Wheat and enjoyed it. I also tried a bit of my friend's calamari which was lightly breaded but way too salty. What turned me off about this place was their disorganized waitstaff. They did a poor job of communicating wait times and were just all around unfriendly (borderline rude). We'll be heading to another bar next time we're in Olde City.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This was our first visit to the Sea Hut after driving by the restaurant for years. We were immediately greeted by the smiling hostess and a pungent smell of old, damp building;  we eventually got use to it.   We started with 3-Crab soup which was pretty good. Flavorful, made with real crab (watch for the sharp and still attached claw shell).   For dinner we had the Fried Clams and Fish Taco's which was one of the featured entrees for the evening.  The portion sizes were adequate. However, the clams were soggy and had more fried batter debris then clams. The fish tacos were, well... unique. Two filets of white fish atop flour tortillas and some pitiful shreds of lettuce.  Frankly, the presentation of the meals was good, but it went downhill fast from there.   Our server was friendly enough and reasonably efficient with the exception of the ""computer losing the fish taco order"" so our meals came out 10 minutes apart. I actually believe him because the entree wasn't listed on the bill but the amount due reflected it.   Apparently the technology was on par with the food. Your basic triple-bogie.   It might have been just an off night for them but we won't be back. It's not worth the risk if this is typical.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"My father in law is 90 years old and is one of the best looking and healthiest 90 year old's on the planet. When he says he wants to go to Joe's Crab Shack, I take him.  I had never been to a Joe's Crab Shack before. I have passed a couple of their locations at different times but this was my first time as a diner. I checked Yelp! and found out they do take reservations as long as they are made a minimum of 5 hours in advance of the dining time (TIP). We had a reservation and some patrons gave us the stink eye who were waiting a while for a table as we were immediately seated upon entering. Thanks Yelp!  The interior is what one would expect, it has a bay side or dockside rustic and charming feel. The tables are simple and much of the seating is bench style. We went with the Arctic Bay Steam Pot-Queen crab, shrimp, a whole Maine lobster and smoked sausage tossed in a garlic butter bath and topped with Old Bay Seasoning. My wife, daughter and I shared this and it was enough food. We did a double portion for an additional $20.00 which was reasonable, the steam pot was good and all of the items tasted fresh. The lobster was a little over cooked but the crab was sweet and moist.  The seafood is cooked in a very classic steamed process. There wasn't a lot of flavor except for the natural flavors of the seafood and some light seasoning. My father in law, wife, and brother in law were all adding vinegar, lemon and hot sauce to enhance the flavors.  I liked Joe's Crab Shack and for a chain it's not bad at all. Certainly a lot better the Red Lobster. It was a fun time and our server was great. The place can be a little noisy. The food was tasty and fresh but I prefer boil type seafood such as Bistro South East on South Street. But Joe's made my father in law happy and that is what really matters.  3.5 solid Yelp stars",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Wow first thing I can say is that this is definitely not a café, it's more of a high-end plant-based experience!  I have a very good friend who is vegan, and this place popped up on our radar, so we decided to go and try it... They have wine and cocktails as well which was a plus.  We did a bunch of different plates, three appetizers and some entrées also dessert so tried quite a few things and the food is very high-level! That atmosphere is beautiful inside, so don't be fooled by the name this is definitely a culinary experience.  The beat sliders, and the kimchi dumplings were amazing... Also we had the Brussel sprouts and potatoes which were beautifully presented. I really like how they put the sauce on the inside of the bowl. But the kimchi dumplings were a masterpiece!  I went ahead with the raw zucchini lasagna, which for an Italian boy would normally be very faux pas, but the taste was exquisite... Really an amazing dish. My friends had the burger, which was great, and the quinoa bowl which also was really good. For dessert we had the coconut cream pie which was also really flavourful and had an amazing nut crust.   You definitely need to check this place out for a nice dinner, it's a little pricey, but you definitely get full value... A really great new unique restaurant in Edmonton!   (PS as a meat eater, I learned that vegan is different than plant-based... Which I learned as this is a plant-based restaurant it really is not only vegan but really healthy, and care is taken on each ingredient. Sometimes just vegan can be not very healthy.)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I've visited these guys twice now. The first time was for the ""pre-opening"" party, it's in quotes because it was open to the public which pretty much means you're open. Right? The second time was Monday of this week for lunch.  For the first visit I ordered five small plates from the limited menu they were offering at the time. Mini Beef Brochettes, Scallops in Cognac Sauce, ""Empanada Madness"", Oyster Shooters and Bruschetta. The food was decent with a few disappointments...  One scallop was overcooked and two were undercooked. They were topped with Tobiko which wasn't listed on the menu description. I think raw ingredients should be listed without a doubt. The empanadas include one cheese, one pork and one chicken. The meats were nondescript and the cheese was basically nonexistent. Oyster shooters were incredibly spicy from black pepper. I like hot food and they made me gasp a bit from the pepper. My friend just about had to spit hers out. The bruschetta was as good as any I've had with nothing really special to it. Mini Beef Skewers were tiny tiny pieces of meat, cooked well and tasty. They're served with mushroom risotto which was the best part of the meal, rich and creamy as it should be. Service on this visit left a lot to be desired. Our server returned about four times to confirm our order. She wrote it down the first time but apparently either her or the kitchen had no clue what it was supposed to mean. When we ordered Pinot Grigio from the menu she must have thought we were speaking Chinese from the look on her face. She walked away before we could explain and came back to ask again what we wanted for drinks. I order a Great Basin Icky and she was stumped again.....  For my second visit I stopped for lunch and ordered ""Ducktastic"". Description off the menu- ""Duck confit over arugula with mushrooms and roasted vegetables in hoisin balsamic dressing"". Mine was served with mixed greens, not straight arugula. The roasted vegetables were cooked and seasoned well. Unfortunately the duck confit, which should be the star of the dish, was buried beneath piles of canned mandarin oranges. The oranges were unexpected from a place that claims they have a ""Chef driven menu using local ingredients"".  Canned mandarin oranges are okay for some things. In this dish they were way off with their level of sweetness and metallic aftertaste. They ruined the flavors of everything else. Almost seems like they made this salad and said ""Hey, this needs more color, let's throw some oranges on there!"".  The service this time was fine. Our server was prompt and polite, only stopped by when needed and had everything to us as ordered. Only comment I could make is that since we were sitting outside and it was sunny he was wearing sunglasses. Can't blame him too much as I had my shades on as well but it's still a little unprofessional.  To be honest I was really hoping for a stellar meal from these guys. After browsing the menu before they opened it seemed very adventurous, maybe too much so. It's rare that a restaurant can pull of the variety of dishes that they offer and do it well. That's why we don;t see many places like this in Reno.   It's worth a shot for another trip as nothing was too terrible to keep me from coming back but it won't be my first pick anytime soon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"We came here for Mothers Day with a large group.  My parents love this place so I went along for the ride.  It is a strip mall restaurant with a takeout window and then a restaurant next to it.    Warm bread is served at the table - excellent and worth coming just for the bread - 5 stars  Pizza- very good - definitely above average with a sweet sauce, which I like - 4+ stars  Stuffed Figs- only 2 of them and the charged $11.99??- 1 Star  Rigatoni- mine came with fresh plum tomatoes in the sauce along with egg plant fresh chunks of mozzarella, which was very good and enough that my wife and I shared the meal.  Comes with a side salad for $18.99-4 stars  She added shrimp on top for $9 extra (and you only get 3 shrimp?)  I ordered  chicken on top, which was a breast butterflied and then overcooked so it was thin and hard.  Manager came by to ask how the food was so I told him - just said ""Really?"" In disbelief- so I told my mom what I said and she says ""they always overcook the chicken""- 1 Star  Ambiance - loud  Service- really seemed to try hard.

"I've driven by Ya-Ya's so many times and finally stopped by to grab lunch to go. I was surprised when I walked into the establishment. The decor definitely hasn't been changed since the 80s and thank goodness that just LOOKS like carpet on the floor and really isn't. They don't take credit or debit and will direct you to an ATM at the front of the store if needed.   Food was just OK. Service was fast- they pulled a white meat chicken piece right off the grill and bagged it with pre-prepped containers of my two sides of choice. Don't go for the mixed veggies- super bland and not fresh. Potato salad was just OK. That honey butter and pita though. My lord, it was divine.   All in all, there are some places that can do the ""we haven't changed since the 80s"". Orlandoians (and anyone traveling to Orlando), think Beefy King.

"Went at lunchtime and was seated fairly quickly. After a brief tutorial I was sent to the rather long and kind of slow moving line to ""build the bowl"". I was able to get quite a lot of meat and veggies stacked up. The meats looked fresh for the most part, with a couple exceptions.  The veggies also looked fresh although some of the options were a bit repetetive. The sauces were kind of a mess and it was difficult to know which one was which, I chose by name and didn't bother tasting.  I was handed a number but wasn't sure if I was supposed to stand there and wait or go sit down. I chose the latter an in about 5 minutes the bowl of steaming food arrived. Overall, I was happy. It was a bit salty and the sauce was a bit strong but that is probably more due to my choices versus how it was prepared.  The only surprise was how much it cost for lunch. After tax and tip it came to $11 and change and I had water with the meal. I know you can go ""bottomless"" for another dollar but $10 plus for lunch is just too much for me.

"This place is definitely 5/5 on AZ-asian-food scale and 4/5 on my CA-asian food scale for sure. I visited here a few times and I think I can now confidently say that Ikkyu can take all my money and I won't even be mad.  Overall, it's a simple ma-n-pop shop with no thrill decor, no fancy service, just solid/ homey/ legit Japanese food. I honestly much prefer eating at ma-n-pop food spots because the price is right and the food is even more right (is that proper grammar?!).   Parking: massive lot shared with Lee Lee supermarket. Come here for lunch or dinner and walk off all those calories by going groceries shopping! Win Win!  Ambience: not much. You order the food and seat yourself, when the food is ready, you serve yourself and fetch your own utensils. At the end of the meal, you put away the dishes on the side. This style of restaurant is very popular in CA in order to keep prices low for smaller businesses, I don't mind serving myself so it's not a problem. But this might not be your spot if you're expecting a fancy sit-down Japanese restaurant.  FOOD: the star, the MVP, the bae   Spicy tonkotsu ramen: BOMBDOTCOM. The meat is flavorful. It comes with bamboo and bean sprouts and all the right veggies. THE BROTH, o my gurd, the broth is always consistent and delicious, it's really not spicy so have no fear my friends. the only con: only available THURS-FRI-SAT. I do wish the chasiu is a bit fattier and why don't they offer eggs :O  Tuna-don volcano style: this is not authentic Japanese food style, i know. But who can say no to a big pile of crack-infused sauce with crunchy thangs on top of a heap of spicy tuna over rice. It's also comes with a warm cup of miso soup. So filling and delish.

"Ordered the Wisherbone sandwich. The chicken was a tiny piece of fried nugget that was about 5 bites on a huge big bun. The sandwich would have been great had the chicken actually been a full fillet that covered the bread. So disappointing.   The red potato salad is quite sweet. I didn't see relish in it. It's a dill potato salad so not sure where the sweetness is coming from unless it's made with miracle whip or sugar is added. $3.75 for a small cup.   Corn bread is on the small side for $2.75. I'd expect a full square for that price. Overall, not impressed with the food or portions of this fast food type place.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"We came out to the burbs from Philly to visit some friends, and came here as a group for an early-Sunday dinner/ Margaritas and football!  The decor in here rocks, and they're all dressed up for Halloween to boot.  It was so over-the-top crazy, but somehow it worked!    We sat down at a big, long table (with chairs of questionable structural integrity), and began to drink.  We ordered 3 pitchers of Margaritas to split and began to munch on homemade tortilla chips and pico de Gallo.  There were 2 bowls of chips/salsa to split between 8 of us, and the boys were hungry!  They went quick.  We spent the majority of time sitting in front of 2 empty bowls, and then when the food came out, our waitress offered to refresh the chips... which was weird timing cuz we had food now... so they sat there.  The margarita's were a bit light on the booze (I drank 3 of them by the conclusion of the evening... and didn't have so much as a buzz... and I'm no linebacker), but they were fine...    I ordered the tofu tacos (2) for dinner, and when they came out, I couldn't decide what about them made them $10!  For a meal like this in the city, I'd expect to pay like $6, and I guarantee it would taste a whole lot better.  I thought they would have spiced up the tofu a bit, but it was literally a white square that had been pan fried, and then covered in some sort of syrupy-sweet sauce.  Ick.  I was hungry enough, so i ate the insides of the tacos and left the shells (tried to pretend it was something different), and my side of cold rice and beans.    My boyfriend got a burrito and it looked about 100% better.  In the car on the way home, he confessed that Qdoba makes a better burrito, but that he was hungry as well, so he ate it.  They make it either crispy, or enchelladaed... which is kind of strange.  I like the intentions of this place, as I spent a good year out in LA, and their Mexican food was to die for!  I wouldn't attempt to relive that experience here though.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"First time visiting new orleans and was constantly referred to this restaurant. Even though I don't eat Oysters I was assured their other dishes were decent. That should have been my first clue that this place had nothing else going for it.  My party ordered the lobster mac & cheese, shrimp seduction,  a catfish platter and a shrimp platter. The Lobster Mac & Cheese was slightly better than average but everything else we had was terrible. The catfish reminded me of a schnitzel because it was pounded paper thin and more breading than fish. You would think being so close to a river the catfish would be plentiful.   The Shrimp Seduction (tomato based shrimp pasta) tasted like chef boyardee and the shrimp were rubbery. We ended up having to send back a few of our plates which of course pissed off our already rude waitress. Towards the end of the meal the manager came over to our table and asked us how the food was. Our faces told her we were unimpressed and she proceeded to ask us if we had the oysters. When we told her no she quickly stated that they do not season their fried foods at all. Louisiana cuisine with no seasonings?!?!?!?!??! I'm sure we weren't the first to complain.  Decor was similar to a cafeteria or buffet in a cheap casino. Service was bad (we had to force the waitress to remove the meals we sent back even after the manager told her too). Even with the bad service we still tipped her but she didn't seem too impressed.

"This place is best for its view, in my opinion.   I came here for dinner about a year ago and the food was decent, from what I could remember. I went today for brunch and did not have a great food experience. The fried scrapple w/runny egg and cheddar on a bun was lame and made me feel gross afterwards (but I also realized I hate scrapple). Bf's fried chicken sandwich seemed like an overpriced McChicken (alright, maybe it was a little higher quality). My bloody mary tasted weird. Maybe there wasn't enough tomato juice and just too much ice which eventually melted - the one slice of bacon (for an extra $2) turned out to be a rip.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We were a table of 4. We had an obviously new server. She couldn't answer any of our menu questions and constantly had to leave and come back with answers. We ordered a dozen charbroiled oysters to start. Those tasted great and were hot. Our entrees came out at room temperature. Not one item we ordered was warm so it wasn't one dish or side that held up the order. The server asked if we wanted to see a manager and we said we didn't we just wanted them to know that the food was cold. One member of our party went to the restroom and ran into our server. He then asked to see a manager. The manager came to the table and apologized. He offered us something to go or a dessert. At this point, we were ready to leave and forget this horrible experience. He did not discount our bill or offer to refund any of the uneaten meals (fried food is horrible cold). This Drago's in located inside a hotel and in very close proximity of the Riverwalk. That must be the reason this place is still open.

"Very disappointing. Our experience would have been good if it weren't for the service.  We came in with a party of 10 after a long day of work. We had to wait for a table (understandable), then wait for a server. He took drink orders, then it was an even longer wait (like 20 minutes) for the drinks to arrive - and they were just fountain drinks and tap beer, nothing special. We had to ask for basics like water.  Food took about 40 more minutes to arrive. That's right, it was over an hour from being seated until we could finally eat. The way it arrived was poor as well. One person's dish came out first, then it was about 5 or 10 more minutes until anyone else's did. They didn't bring out silverware until after we asked.   When the second delivery of food showed up, two of the dishes were wrong and had to be sent back. One person who ordered a salad didn't receive her ranch dressing until about 10 minutes after her salad showed up.  The food tasted good, at least - once the problems had been corrected. And I do say ""good"" on purpose, because it was fine and not great. I ordered chicken tacos with a side of veggies. The chicken was a little chewy (overdone), but flavorful; the vegetable of the day ended up being green beans (not the most elegant pairing with Mexican flavors), and they were over cooked and bland. They hadn't even been prepped properly; many of them still had stems on.  During the meal, a few people ordered additional drinks but they took ages to arrive. One person ordered a cider that took about half an hour - even though all that needed to happen with it was to pop the top off because it was a bottle.  Finally, once it was all done, the checks showed up. Half of them were wrong - drinks were showing up on checks with the wrong person's meal. That took another 20 minutes to fix.  All in all, we spent well over 2.5 hours here, which wasted the evening. This review was going to be 1 star, but I decided to give 2 because at least the bad service was polite and apologetic. Will not be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I have to have my head examined or get bariatric surgery or have an alarm system wired into my brain, in my impulsivity center. I just cannot trust myself to be rational when I'm on the loose, unaccompanied and hungry. Today was just another example of my poor judgment . I needed/wanted to eat having had nothing but coffee by 1 PM and was out sort of looking for a place instead of having made up my mind ahead of time. Found myself driving into a comfort food haven, aka Claim Jumper. I am sooooo sorry. Couldn't decide but wanted meat so I wound up ordering a baby-back rib lunch plate. The ribs were okay, commercial tasting bbq sauce, cooked 'til tender but the rest of the plate was a disaster. If I was the chef I would be ashamed to send this out of the kitchen and whomever makes up the menu should be banished from the food industry altogether.  (I""m still taking responsibility for making the choice here). Came with mashies and gravy. Looked and tasted like a plastic food display. Stiff, gummy, lumpy, Bah! And then the second great ""side"" was a piece of thick white bread with melted cheese on it. Oh, lord!! Ate the ribs, made sure to register my dissatisfaction, was offered but declined a dessert to go, paid way to much money, and left. Looking for comfort in all the wrong places.

"Mong Kok has much to owe to its location on 10th street, and its extremely conspicuous neon orange signage. Smart on their part. This place is also open later than other bakeries It is by this more people come, and therefore more people say ""it's the best bakery!"" By all accounts, I beg to differ. This place is mediocre at best.   1. Their selection is decent, and on par with other large bakeries. They have nothing unique, and are missing large almond cookies and mooncakes, but that's fine.  2. Their quality, mediocre. Nothing is really warmed. Some bakeries' pastries are still warmed by their display machines and whatnot, but not Mong Kok's - I pretty much expect Mong Kok's to be meh whenever I go there.   3. Prices of pastries in Chinatown are pretty much all the same, +/- $0.05.  There are more organized, cleaner, less cramped bakeries in Chinatown with better quality pastries. Just spend 5 minutes to look for another one, and it'll be almost guaranteed to be better than Mong Kok's. However, it's not a terrible bakery by any means.

Everything tasted out of a can or a frozen bag as far as the vegetables go, and they were over salted by a lot. Not even edible. The pasta noodles were also overcooked and watery. Sadly, the chicken was not even anything special at all. I got four sides (okra, macaroni and cheese, beans and rice, sweet potatoes) and I liked (not loved) everything actually but it came to my table barely warm. The rice with the beans and rice seemed like minute rice. The peach cobbler was pretty good although not the best I've ever had but of all the items we had it was certainly the best.

"I love this place! Itake almost everyone visiting me in Philadelphia here because I think it's a must-stop for brunch.   There are, of course, a few downsides. Typically there's about a 1 to 2 hour wait for a table on the weekends. There are no reservations available and they will pretty much call your name when your table is ready and if you don't respond, it will be gone. No phone call, no text, nothing. This pretty much requires that you stick around the restaurant, so be prepared for a wait outside. Of course, this also means that the inside of the restaurant is typically packed full, so it's always pretty loud and hectic. I don't mind this at all -- I kind of prefer my brunch to be full of activity -- but if you're looking for somewhere peaceful or quiet, this might not be the best option.  The portions of food here are extremely generous -- I always end up leaving with leftovers galore. It's a bit pricey, but nothing out of the ordinary for a brunch. Food-wise, I usually get an omelette with fruit instead of potatoes. It's extremely filling. Also, if I'm feeling like a treat, I'll split one of the delicious sweet treats on the menu with my table. My favorite has to be the creme brulee french toast, which is literally to die for.

I don't care to out the waitress but she should have said ""would you like to add meatballs and salad"" or state that the Ravioli was l la carte but she didn't and when we got the bill the meatballs and salad where extra. I didn't mind paying for it but anyone in hospitality should never assume it's ok and up sell consumers like that. I will say the waitress was a great waitress however, she now has a distrust label and I will not want her as a waitress. I've also learned that I need to do my homework when at a new place so I don't get up sold.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Food and service are above average. My problem was the excessive noise from a table of about 5 adults and 7 or 8 children seated in the dining room. The adult males were screaming at the basketball game on TV. None of the adults were supervising the children, who were also screaming. It's a dining room at a restaurant, not Chuckie Cheese. All of the customers in the dining room were complaining about the unbearable noise. We went to this restaurant with a good friend we hadn't seen in a while and wanted to have a conversation. Instead, I left with a migraine headache. They need to get rid of a few of the TV's which are plastered wall to wall and blaring out sports. That would deter some of the animals who don't know how to behave in public.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I tried to adjust my reservation for a Saturday night table from 6 to 7 people and they told me it just couldn't be done.   A couple days later, they called to tell me they had a cancellation and offered the extra room for my party if we still wanted it.  I thought this was a good way to start a relationship with a restaurant. The seven of us in my party were celebrating a birthday and this family style dinner was really good.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  We even tried the gizzards, as so many yelpers insisted, and I admit, they were good.   The staff was fast, friendly and attractive; collectively, they were like a dream date.  The price was reasonable and the birthday dessert arrived with a candle.   What more can you ask for?

We arrived at 12:20, but luckily there wasn't a long wait and we were quickly seated. We ordered our meal, along with a bottle beer and Sake while waiting for our order to come out. We waited.. and waited.. and waited. People came in after us, were seated and we watched table after table receive their food before us. After a 30 minute wait, we decided to leave without eating and ended up going to another restaurant.   It's been a while since I've last been to Sake, but things seem to have taken a turn for the worse as far as service goes.

"This is covid times. The low score is about covid. Quick breakdown: Food - 4 to 5 stars Service: 2 stars but I was hangry so I'll bump it up to 3 Covid safety- 2 stars -- they wore masks but didn't make eat in diners social distance  I came here to get takeout. They told me 20 minutes so I showed up 25 min after I called. They didn't acknowledge me for a bit because they had actual people eating in the establishment. Not great but that's technically allowed I guess...  When I got to speak with someone they told me my order wasn't ready and to sit down. I sat down for 20 minutes and didn't get addressed at all.   While I was trying to wait, two large groups showed up with reservations. So this space as three large circular tables clustered pretty close together. All three tables were occupied. There was no social distancing.  Finally I got to the counter again and they said my food was ready... But I thought it was one of the bags already there from the start... So I was confused.  I took my food home. It was delicious. I have very few complaints about that. The chicken wasn't very crispy but very flavor. I really want to try this place again post pandemic... But not during the pandemic. They just don't follow safe pandemic practices and it worries me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"First of all, I made our reservation weeks ago and the lady up front didn't check us in even though they took us to the lounge so we had to track someone down 20 min after the reservation should have started to find out she never checked us in. Then, the waiter was extremely shady while taking orders. When we ordered he asked what kind of salad we wanted (assuming this was included by the way he worded this) then when the check came, they were very expensive. He asked if we wanted a small side of lobster to mix in, we said yes, we were charged 38$ for that.  In addition, we couldn't find him for over THIRTY minutes when we were ready to leave. We asked people and they said he was coming, yet never showed until I stood up to find the manager. I wanted to also bring up the lobster Mac and cheese but at this point we just wanted to leave. My husbands steak was good but my lobster tail was mediocre.

"Although this place seems to be a New Orleans/Creole/Cajun place, I decided to get the Fillet Mignon Sandwich and homemade chips. I know this was a bit retarded, but I was in the mood for a juicy steak, and a sandwich was the cheapest way to get it. The meat was cooked a little more rare than I asked for it, but it was very tender and juicy. Not much flavor (salt, seasonings) in it though. However, the chips were blow me away fabulous. Even though I got takeout, most of the chips were still fresh and crispy. I really might need to take a trip to eat the chips fresher and in person. They had just the right amount of (Cajun?) seasoning and were fried perfectly. A few other friends also ordered food from here, and the reviews were decent, but no ravings. I include this just in case you wanted some thought regarding the more Cajun/Creole fare.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

You get large portions for very little money and the quality is always good.  I'd definitely recommend this restaurant.

"I'm giving Bodega two stars with the caveat that I visited on opening night (last Friday, Jan. 24) and acknowledge that the problems I perceived are very fixable kinks.  That said, I'm not in any rush to go back any time soon.    The decor is nice enough, but the whole bar feels very dark (even shortly after 5 p.m. when it is still light outside) and it was noisy enough that my friend and I had to raise our voices to talk with each other.  We were lucky and grabbed two corner seats at the bar, despite the crowd, but that was only because we knew one of the guys leaving those seats -- and he was trying to get out to find a better bar.    We followed suit and also hightailed it out of there after one round of drinks.  I had the opportunity to taste four different cocktails, thanks to two more friends who joined us at the bar for a little while -- but unfortunately none of the four were very good.  The Pinalita tasted like nothing but pineapple juice, and the Cuban Cappuccino was so sugary it was almost undrinkable.  The bourbon cocktail was not bad, but it was nothing in comparison to the many bars around Midtown (and the city as a whole) that offer phenomenal bourbon cocktails.  The fourth drink was so unremarkable that I honestly don't even remember what it was.  Meanwhile, service was okay at best.  The staff was obviously new and seemed pretty overwhelmed.  I overheard someone else at the bar ordering a daiquiri, and the bartender helping him just responded with a blank stare.  After several mildly uncomfortable seconds passed, she told him they didn't have all their cocktails available yet and asked if he could order something else.  That message didn't comport with what our bartender had told us, so I'm not sure whether she just didn't know how to make a daiquiri or they truly didn't have the supplies -- but, either way, it wasn't a great look.    We didn't try any food, so I can't comment on that.  Based on the other reviews Bodega has received so far, I am wondering if maybe the trick is to order only margaritas at Bodega and focus on the food instead of treating it as a happy hour/cocktail/nightcap spot.  Or maybe the key is just to avoid opening night, which most people reading this have already accomplished.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The food isn't bad, but it's a bit overpriced for what it is. It's always loud and crowded, and service was very slow when we were there.

"I'd seen this place recently on my way home and decided to try it. I've gone to Golden Dragon at Swan and Sunrise, and thought their food was eeh and too salty. This same location used to be a different Chinese place prior, and I had not been that impressed, but since it changed I decided why not give it a try! I'm glad I did.   My mom and I shared the Broccoli beef and were able to choose between steamed rice, brown rice or Singapore chow mein, we decided on the brown rice, which was good (a little sticky). Also decided to give their crabpuffs a chance. They were delish! The orange sauce that came with them was nice, fresh, and zesty. They also were fast in the making, when we called they said to come pick it up in 5 minutes!! Wow! I was scared of the quality, but it was yummy, with lots of veggies and just enough sauce.   FYI: This is definitely a pick up your take out or call for delivery place. They don't have anywhere for people to sit down and eat. Also their menu isn't online yet.

"We headed to Butcher and Singer for a dinner with a small group of friends for New Years Eve. I was so happy that they weren't doing a limited fixed price menu. First things first we ordered a round of fancy cocktails. Then we ordered a few appetizers; oysters, a wedge salad and calamari to start. Oysters were delicious, calamari was pretty good, and the wedge salad was good, but I wasn't a fan of the thousand island dressing on it, would have preferred blue cheese.   For dinner everyone ordered steaks, duh. My husband and I split the aged rib eye which was buttery and cooked to perfection. For our sides we shared the stuffed hash browns, onion rings and the asparagus. The stuffed hash browns are ridiculously amazing and I would go back for those and a steak alone. The other two sides were fine, but nothing amazing.   The winning course of this dinner (besides our steak) was the dessert. We shared carrot cake, baked Alaska, and a super-moist chocolate cake. All of the desserts were amazing!   I've been to Butcher and Singer once before for their burger lunch special.

So I pulled in, went to order and immediately recognized it as a chain that I had been to once in Nevada.  Nice guy at the counter recommended the pulled pork, and I got that with slaw and fries and a drink.  My bad, I thought it was going to be a sandwich, but it was a ""platter"" type of deal with the meat piled on some paper on my tray.  No biggie.  The pork was pretty average, but really dry.  The slaw was out of a jar, and really bland.  The fries were waffle cut and quite fine.  They have 3 sauces at the self serve counter, all flavored about the same with varying degrees of sweet/heat.

"The Courthouse Cafe is the closest restaurant to my new office, directly across the street from the red brick Church of the Redeemer and catercorner from both the new & old Mercer County courthouses. I have stopped in for a quick meal now and then when going to/departing these halls of justice over many years. Although the name used to be Gus's, it still looks and feels the same.  It is old school. It slings traditional breakfasts and lunches for the courthouse and state worker crowds, and keeps quality, creativity and price in balance for the limited time and budget restraints of their market. It does this well, as can be seen by the full house at lunch and the empty seats after about 1:30.  My Chicken Salad on Rye Toast was a decent sandwich. Fresh ingredients. Good bread. The side of fries was okay and the thimble cup of sweet slaw pretty tasty. At around $8 with tax, it was a fair deal.  The Turkey & Swiss was likewise a solid lunch, as was the Chicken Salad & Bacon Melt I had last week.   Ownership is in the house and involved in everything.

"EVERY SINGLE TIME I GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!!!  I used to go to this place once every few months for a pick up lunch order.  It's hard to mess up a pick up lunch order and they usually didn't.  Sometimes I'd have to stand at the vacant counter searching for an employee for too long but that was usually the worst of it.  Dining in is a whole different story.  It seems every time I get dragged in here by some family member or friend something goes wrong.   Sometimes the food is cold. Sometimes the food is wrong.  Sometimes the drinks never get re-filled. Sometimes the silverware is dirty.  Sometimes something is floating in the water.  Sometimes the check never shows up.  Sometimes the waiter disappears.    My mother and my kids went to IHOP on the 25th of July.  I got dragged along of course and - not surprisingly something went wrong - the bigger story is that surprisingly - everything mentioned in the previous paragraph went wrong!!! WOW!!!!

For my entree I order the grilled trout with out capers. It was brought to me full of capers. The waiter took it to the kitchen and they scrapped off most of the capers and put it back in an over or skillet and brought it back. There were still capers on it and was burnt and not edible. I sent it back and order the chicken Milanese without capers. The chicken Milanese was beat to death and full of capers. I tried it and it was gross almost like it was made by someone who never cooked. I was done at this point the manager insisted I try something else.

Stir fried rice was a bit oily and the stir fried chow mein and chow fun were oilier for our taste. Other wise our waitress was nice.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Do not go here if you're hungry, because you won't even be acknowledged as a customer for at least 25 minutes. Once you finally get helped, if you're lucky, you won't get the food you ordered for about an hour. Granted, they provided SOME of the food we ordered, but no utensils, napkins, or sauce to eat it with. The food was pretty good, but it didn't make up for the terrible customer service. There was only one server who continued to mention how backed up they were, yet there were only 3 tables with parties seated at them. Pretty unfortunate that this is the closest sushi place accessible to UA students :(",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Pancake Pantry is known for serving up ""Nashville's Best Pancakes"" and is indeed a place that tourists come to indulge in some short stacks. Located in Hillsboro Village, it is convenient if you plan to do a bit of shopping in the area before heading on to the next activity.   When we came here on a Sunday mid-morning,  the line was out the door as expected. However, it was just about a 15 minute wait to get a table which really wasn't bad at all.  Server was very nice and other staff come around to refill your water glasses and take away any empty plates. Ambiance is just okay, it is like any other diner-type setting. When you get ready to leave you can pay at the register at the front.   If you're going to come here you have to get the pancakes. Any other decision would just be ludicrous as it is part of the name of the place after all! With a large array of different pancakes on the menu I wasn't sure whether to make an out-of-the-box selection like the sweet potato pancakes or to go the more traditional route to play it safe. I ended up going to traditional route with the blueberry pancakes...because I knew this was something that couldn't possibly go wrong. The pancakes were fluffy and the compote was not overly sweet which I like. Got a side of the bacon as well which is always a good decision.   I thought that this place is pretty good, but nothing about it made me excited and feel like I have to come back here. Classic, sure but maybe just not interesting enough for me. If I'm coming to pay $8+ for a plate of pancakes I want a side of something else and more for my money as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"3.5 stars.  Ms Michelle C steered me to this place earlier in the week. It's in a small shop across the street from the strip mall with the Dunkin Donuts and pizza place on Haddon Ave. The decor is pretty minimal, but I""m about the food, not the fru fru.  I ordered the enchiladas verdes and some horchata. The waitress brought out some chips and salsa. The one odd thing was that they put refried beans on top of the chips, which made it a bit messy to eat. The salsa was a red salsa, not too thick and not too thin and full of spice. By the time I got done eating the chips and salsa my nose was running. The horchata was sweet and had a lot of cinnamon in it. It helped quench the fire of the salsa.  The enchiladas came out on a big plate. The verdes sauce covered the enchiladas and the plate, which gave me a flashback to Plaza Garibaldi. However, this verdes sauce was very tasty. You could tell they made there own verdes sauce with fresh tomatillos. Either that or they found the best canned tomatillos. The chicken enchiladas pretty good, as was the mexican rice, which had some peas and carrots cut up in it.  I will definitely be back to try some of their other dishes. The tacos sounded really good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Terrible experience, and we (my boyfriend and I) rarely ever feel that way. It was a busy Friday night, so we expected to wait, but not everything else we experienced. It took several minutes for the host to even take our name down, and we could tell it was a disorganized mess. We finally got our name in and sat a table in the patio area to wait, like many others were. After about 30 minutes some of the servers started bringing a few of the people waiting water and chips and salsa. We thought that was a nice gesture, but we and some of the other tables never received any. Throughout our wait we also saw many other parties seated that had arrived after us. About another 20 minutes went by and we were finally seated.   The waiter came by and took our drink order and brought us water. A couple minutes later another waiter/waitress came by, and looked confused that we had already ordered our drinks and walked off seemingly perturbed about that. The waiter then dropped off our drinks but didn't take our order. We sat for 15-20 minutes and no one came by to take our order or check on us. Finally the waiter came by with more drinks in his hand, looking confused that we had already had drinks (by this point we had finished them), and then just walked away. My boyfriend flagged him down and asked him if we could just get the check, and he had no problem bringing that and picking up the card right away. We spent probably a total of an hour and a half there just to get some stale chips and a drink for each of us. We know that restaurants are under an immense staffing crisis; however, the other tables around us seemed to have sufficient service. Not sure if it was just a fluke night or what, but the whole experience was enough to make us not want to go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Ok so the staff and building we're great. I had a long walk there and I got a water and coffee right away. Coffee was nothing special but it was ok. I went with the Crawfish gravy and biscuits. I mean I'm I Nola so why not do it right. It looked really good and the portion was generous. That said it just was not that good. The biscuits we're way to dense and dry. The gravy could have had more crawfish and I actually had a shrimp in my gravy. It just didn't work overall with the biscuits. I had an egg on the side and I will say it was a perfect scrambled egg and I wish had ordered more eggs. I'm sure if I had the chance id find the right food here.

"I love salt + smoke but the last 3 times that we've gone the food has been quite disappointing, it has def gone downhill. Food did not seem fresh and was cold. Brisket was cut so thick and was dry, lacked any flavor. It used to be juicy and full of flavor. Mac and cheese had like whole ritz crackers in it! Some parts were cheesy and some parts had no cheese, the consistency in every bite was off. They no longer have the burnt ends toasted ravs, don't know why. Their beef fat fries used to have chopped garlic and parsley garnish which gave the fries so much more flavor and now it's just dry overcooked fries. The last 3 times we've gone they've been out of the popovers which is another one of our favorites there, instead we just got what seems like store bought dinner rolls.

I paid more for the dinner all you can eat and I can tell you I was happier with the Mana roll from the lunch menu.   The Hawaiian gimmick translates to merely a few slices of fruit scattered amongst your dishes, and looks more like a bartender dropped them on the dishes as they sat forgotten by the food runners.  The one the bright side of our meal was the bus boy who kept the table free of dishes. The rest of the wait staff was merely adequate as far as service goes.

I never seen her before in the past. Her name was Bridgette I believe. She completely ruined my order and my colleagues. Which was quite embarrassing since I was just bragging about how great this place was.     We were hungry so instead of our chicken milanse ( my recommendation), we ate chicken marsala. It was delicious but not what I ordered. A manager never came over to talk which was weird since they are always very attentive. She did offer us a free glass of wine but it was a little early. We were her last table upstairs, so I'm not sure if she was maybe in a rush... Right when we finished eating she took the plates from us, rather aggressively. Didn't offer us coffee or dessert but proceeded to present the bill.     I hope I never get this server again! She even charged me for tap water.

Most of the wait staff were NOT wearing masks and they have signs saying they are optional. We did not like this but we were to tired and hungry to go searching for something else so we stayed.

I have driven past this restaurant on numerous of occasions and decided to take a good friend of mine out while she was visiting the Philadelphia. I was dying to try this ceviche because that is what is advertised on the marquee. So then I was told by the waitress who was a sweetheart that this ceviche is more so an appetizer which I found to be quite interesting and priced at $17. The taste was horrible. My appetizer was delicious but as someone mentioned below it came out at the same time as the entree.The waitress kept apologizing for the behavior of the kitchen. The best item on my plate happened to be the appetizer which was this spicy sausage served with French fries that we really enjoyed. I feel like this was a gentrified take of  Peruvian  food.

"This was a very nice place to have dinner, al fresco, late on a warm summer afternoon.  What I especially liked was how many of their sushi rolls are original creations.  I had the ""Blue Man Roll"" (tuna, crab, and mango), while my honey had the ""Banzai Roll"" (cucumbers, green onions, salmon, avocado).  These two were a little on the smallish side; though others were a bit larger, Arigato is probably not a place to go if you're starving and not prepared to drop a fair number of bills.  That said, everything was very nicely presented, and the service was attentive.    All in all, a little on the expensive side, but it was fine and mostly nicely done.

"We ordered two servings of Sweet and Sour soup and 7 sushi rolls on a rainy Saturday night. We ordered on grubhub at around 7pm. It took over an hour and half for our delivery to arrive (grubhub estimated about an hour). Sweet and sour soup was huge for only $4. We ordered spicy crab roll, spicy tuna roll, mango roll, sweet potato roll and 3 special rolls (chorishi fire roll, volcano roll, zen roll). The spicy tuna, volcano and zen rolls were our favorites. Both volcano and zen rolls were pretty similar as both had shrimp tempura and eel sauce. The zen roll was a little lighter tasting as it also had cream cheese inside.  Prices were pretty average for sushi in the City- $4 for fruit roll, $5-5.50 for regular roll (spicy tuna or crab) and  $11-$12 for special roll. And I would say the quality was pretty average. I know that some places in the city charge more than this for special rolls, but they also provide larger, more interesting rolls than this place. The special rolls were decent but nothing that spectacular. Mango roll was pretty boring- just a piece of mango in some rice.  Like: - Very large menu- both Chinese and Japanese options - Huge serving for soup - Soup was still very hot when it was delivered - No delivery charge - Delivery man was very nice   Dislike: - Took over hour and a half for delivery (rainy Saturday night at dinner time could have something to so with this)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The third visit was problematic. I ordered two of the same burger - one medium and one medium well. The guy taking the order said so you want a double?  Uh, no, 2 of the same burger.   After ringing me up, I noticed that the ticket said sub American. When I asked why he substituted a different cheese that I did not ask for, he said, oh, not sure how that happened.    When the food was delivered, he said ""I do not know how to tell which one is medium and which one is medium well"". He looked confused and left us to figure it out. Both we well done.    We ordered the half and half fries. They delivered a full basket of sweet potato fries and said the regular fries would take a while.   When the other fries arrived, I asked for a to go container.

"Who writes Yelp reviews of McDonald's? A customer who always has a uniquely bad experience at the same place. That's who.  The McDonalds at Exit 35 (Springfield/Joelton) on I-24 is the dirtiest McDonald's I have ever experienced. And it has been that way on a regular basis for some time.  The toilets and sinks in the bathroom look dirty, not only from wear and neglect, but really not being cleaned either. At the drink fountain and condiment bar, the dispensers for the napkins have an icky accumulation in the cracks, and what looks like food drippings that has not been cleaned in weeks. On my last visit, there was no top on the sweet tea dispenser, allowing anything in the air (dust, customer's sneezes) to settle there. Thankfully, I don't drink sweet tea. The whole drink fountain showed evidence of not being regularly cleaned, nor did any of the tables. On top of that, the counter person, who did not appear to be new or inexperienced, left two items off my order and prepared my eat-in order to go.  Look, no one expects French service at McDonald's. What every customer can and should expect from McDonald's, however, is a consistent, clean environment, serving cheap and decent food, with consistent, accurate service that is up to the standards for which the company is known.  This location clearly does not hit any of those marks.  All that said, let me make a general comment on McDonald's:  I am OK with McDonald's. I'm a field agent, on the road every day, and they are a frequent landing point for me because they always have reliably available Wi-Fi, a certain standard of cleanliness, and some (SOME) decent items on the menu at low prices. I can eat lunch on the road, do a little work undisturbed, and get out the door cheaply. Panera and Starbucks are good stops for road workers like me, for the Wi-Fi and decent work space, but you struggle to have a meal on the cheap. I am in the field literally every day, and spending $8-$10 a day, every day, on lunch makes no sense for workers like me.  But at McDonald's I can have one of the under-400-calorie sandwiches, a side salad with dressing (balsamic vinaigrette; why does the staff always assume ranch?) and a large un-sweet tea for around $3.25, feel like I ate something, feel like I didn't kill my nutritional program, feel like I didn't blow my budget and get my work done.  The problem I have with them is that there are so many items on their menu that you just shouldn't put in your body. Their marketing is designed to point you towards high-calorie, high-carb, low-nutrition items. As I said, there are some good alternatives on the menu, and with some personal responsibility, common sense and self-discipline, you can make good choices. But it's like crossing a minefield: you shouldn't enter a minefield if you don't have to, and if you do, plan ahead and watch your step. But the guy who lays the minefield does bear some responsibility for the consequences.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

The tuna on the sushi looked brown as opposed to the normal deep red color. We were hesitant to even try it based on the color. We've never seen sushi grade tuna that looked like this before, not appealing to the eye. With that said, it still tasted decent and wasn't fishy. The fried rice was bland with little flavor. I never like writing negative reviews but we had high hopes and were definitely let down. Once was enough for us as we will not return.

Unfortunately, the food has really seemed to go downhill since new management has taken over, and it is overpriced. We used to go in all of the time for pizza and it is very inconsistent now - sometimes burned other times not fully cooked. With the amount of quality restaurants and bars in Northern Liberties, this should be addressed immediately. I think they would also benefit from a brunch menu/specials.

The pizza was not worth the price. The name ""Noble Crust"" would hopefully imply good pizza but it was disappointing. The crust was covered with flour on the bottom and it was very flimsy. The crust was not crispy at all. The chicken Parmesan was a good choice and so was the house salad. It was both delicious and beautiful. Another good choice is the chicken marsala. It is served over grits, which sounds odd, but it is surprisingly delightful. It was the best chicken Marsala I have ever had.  The service is good, but our water glasses were all dirty. The server was very nice, apologetic, and replaced them quickly.  The decor was my favorite part of the experience. It has a very nice aesthetic and feels very modern. Both the interior and exterior of the restaurant is beautiful.  Overall, the salad and chicken dishes are the best choice. They are very good and I would definitely recommend it.

"Had a pleasant experience at Origami last night. As other posters have mentioned, they did a great job renovating dingy Friar Tucks. It is well decorated, with a calming atmosphere. We had great service, and our waiter worked hard to be sure we had everything we wanted, were never short on water etc.  Pretty typical roll prices - $5 for the standard rolls, $10-$15 for the specialties. While that may seem high for specialty rolls, these were huge! We got the Tiger Roll (which was fine) and the Burning Man Roll (which was amazing). There were a lot of other interesting specialty rolls on the menu that I am excited to come back and try.  Really my only issue was that my Special Eel Roll was completely falling apart. 6 of the 8 pieces unravelled as I picked them up, and it was just not very impressive. This isn't the worst thing in the world, but I would expect a sushi restaurant to be able to make a standard roll correctly.  I definitely plan on going back to try the rest of the menu. Its nice to have a new sushi spot in New Orleans.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Just left and back home. I guess I have to take into consideration they have only been open a week. The show to day was nice but short. My server was a nice young lady. kept my drinks full! I guess I was a little disappointed, because it is early afternoon and most were eating the buffet (which looked wonderful). So i ordered off the menu and ordered the Macho Nachos with guacamole. The food came out by someone other than my server, (which was nice because it meant the food would still be warm and not cold). They sat it down and walked away....NO Guac (I love guac and i heard they made theirs from scratch)!! So I waited 5 minutes no server baby (he is my hero) called another over, I asked if i could get my guac. she I saw told someone else, Then nothing... 10 minutes later i see my server asked for the guac. she was very sorry and went right then to get it for me and was back asap....NO GUAC.... seems i waited for nothing they were out grrrr(or they just had not made any i find it hard that before 130 with a buffet they could have ran out) i know eat my COLD not so Macho Nacho. The flavor was good i will say that. I will go back and give another chance since they are newly opened maybe by then the kinks will be worked out!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Why do you go to Wendy's? Because nothing else is open. It's 1am and you get that burger craze. It's the burbs and nothing is open. Except Wendy's!

"This location is normally a 4-5 star experience for us, whenever we come here. Saturday seemed to be an off day for the place. We met some family here for a family dinner. 5 of us. Seating wasnt an issue, service was. Place didnt seem busy. There were 2 mid size parties. Drink ordered went in smoothly. We ordered 2 of the famous chicken tortilla soups. Our favorite. Mine was packed full of chicken, avocado and vegies, while my wife's soup was like a broth with barely any filler in it. We ended up asking for a another bowl. Our server seemed dismissive of our table, opting to instead pay more attention to a group in the back room. On more than 1 occasion, we had to ask another staff member for help. Another server took our order. Food came out in a timely manner. My med rare steak came out very raw. Not rare, but very raw. Had to wait 5 mins to find someone to take the steak back. It came back a few minutes more , cooked enough but now less flavorful.    Such a disappointing meal. Hopefully it was just one of those days.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This is our first time back here in many years. In fact, this is our first time here since they moved to this location. Was hoping for a great meal but it was not to be. I ordered the #3 combo, taco, Red Chili, and a cheese enchilada. Wife ordered the shredded beef enchiladas. The red chili was very tender but had absolutely no flavor the taco was good but the cheese enchilada was hard to find under all the beans and rice. Everything was just thrown on the plate. Wife said that the shredded beef was very good but the sauce had no flavor. The salsa they give you with the chips also has no flavor. Now I am not expecting spicy, hot, or anything like that. But please, some flavor!  Service was excellent and Rob, our server was great. Prompt, attentive, always there to help. Price is reasonable for what you get.

"Christmas Eve dinner with my parents started out good. The Salmon pate amuse and Prince Edward mussels were delicious and reminded us of our time living in the Pacific Northwest. My house salad was good. The dressing light with a hint of citrus. The Pork Belly Salad Mom and Dad had were ok but the creole mustard dressing was heavy and over done. It needed to be lightened or thinned or served on the side. The disappointing parts were all in the main course. Filet tournedos ordered med rare were medium. Scallops served with them were overcooked and rubbery, the green beans were over cooked, wrinkly and soft with no crisp or toothsomeness, and clearly it had waited for service because the arugula on the plate was shriveled. Dad's Halibut was overcooked and dry, the root vegetables were actually delicious, but what was thought to be sauteed mushrooms and onions was actually brussel sprouts so over cooked to lacking in color and tasting like smothered cabbage which doesn't really go with Halibut in my mind the way properly cooked green brussel sprouts would have. We actually thought they subbed out the sprouts for mushrooms. Mom's red snapper was also over cooked and dry with the second root vegetables as Dad's but she also was unfortunate to have a similar batch of green beans as I had: wrinkly and soft and mushy in your mouth. We reviewed the dessert menu but it was mainly one note of chocolate and/or caramel with only an option of pavlova or creme brulee if you were looking to finalize your meal.   Our server was lovely and did a great job but overall, they appeared to be slightly under staffed and the kitchen backed up.  Over all...... But not sure I'll be back to try them on a less busy night since I live not far from the restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I visited Kallejon 813 on a Friday during lunch.    The menu looked fantastic and someone who seemed like the owner spoke English and was enthusiastic about explaining any menu items we had questions about.  My Spanish is unfortunately a 2 on a scale from 1-10.    I ended up ordering Yuca fries and a pork sandwich called a pan con chicharron.    The service was good and the food came out really quickly.  Unfortunately the food lacked flavor.  Not in a minor way but in a shockingly how did you make this without any flavor!!!!! Kind of way!   This business opened around March 2020 at the beginning of Covid and they have lasted a year.  They are working on a new menu and I really hope the food issue was due to a lack of demand therefore a lower quality product due to a business trying to stay afloat.    They new menu looks great, and this place could be a new Peruvian gem if they fix the lack of flavor issue.    Please check this place out as the menu is changing and I think they need business to support what could be a gem of a place in Tampa.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I had Valentines Day brunch here on Sunday.  This was my second visit to this restaurant and the second time we've sent food back.  There's a lot of great food in this city so it's hard to want to come back a third time honestly.  They have good ideas here.  The menu is interesting, the service is good (mostly).  I ordered the cochon gumbo for the first course.  It was ok, a little too salty for my taste and I really like salty.  It was a theme for the day unfortunately.  There wasn't a lot of food in the bowl but it was an ok 1st course portion.  It wasn't a remarkable dish in any case.  For a second course I had a spanish tortilla with mizuna greens and romesco sauce.  A pile of potato tart with some crawfish tails on top.  It was good.  I liked it with the romesco.  The mizuna greens were so salty as to be inedible.  Absolutely couldn't eat them.  Did they do this because my wife sent her 1st course salad back because it was way too salty?  Did the waitstaff not tell them about the 1st course?  I said something about my salad and she put my wife's plate on top of mine, said she was going to tell the kitchen then promptly just dumped the dishes and went back to what she was doing.    The manager, before I got my 2nd course, sent out a really nice smoked catfish dish because we were unhappy and I had said something about the food runner that was delivering bowls of food with his thumb inserted deep into the dish.   I'm not sure why I am giving them 3 stars actually.  We were really underwhelmed for sure.  Too bad, we live 0.2 miles from here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I came here for some breakfast. I was seated promptly. I got a country omelette and an orange juice. The best part of this meal was the orange juice. I asked for no butter on my toast, and no cheese in the omelette. I have a milk allergy. The waitress informed me there wasn't cheese in this specific omelette. I got toast with butter on it, the omelette didn't have cheese. As far as the meal. The omelette was nothing to write home about. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to eat it. The breakfast came with hashbrowns.  Again no flavor whatsoever.  Even after salt, pepper, and ketchup. I couldn't get the waitresses attention to get toast without butter so I went without. I waited for fifteen minutes after she asked if I wanted anything else, waited no longer and with no check in hand, walked to the cash register and paid. During the breakfast there was confusion among the staff and the owner as they decided to change which waitress covered what tables.

"Solid food and solid service.  The first time we ate here, I got the portabella sandwich, which was tasty but no wow factor,  and fries,  and thoroughly enjoyed sitting outside with a beer in perfect weather.  The next time we went was for dinner with friends. I was originally going to order the grilled cheese, but it was the last evening of Devour Indy, so we weren't going to pass up on that. $20 per person was a good deal. The baked goat cheese appetizer was delicious and reminded me of when we lived in Chicago and had a penchant for the tapas restaurants. I tried the hubs' tomato basil bisque, which was also really tasty, but the oyster crackers detracted from it,  in my opinion.  For the main course, I got the eggplant and summer squash ragu. I was expecting something more ""herbful""  ..no idea why... but it was pretty tasty for an eggplant-as-the-star-but-no-parmesan dish. The quinoa that it came with...well, I have not had quinoa that I thought ""ooh I must make this at home"", and this was no exception. Hubs and a friend got the Cajun brisket fettuccine,  which looked really good and made me wonder if I wouldn't have been better off getting a pasta dish. Dessert... now, I'm not a real dessert fan, but cheesecake is something I will rarely turn down. The cheese cake with raspberry sauce was fresh tasting and delicious. I also tried some of the pecan ball, and, while not something I would order, I can see why it's on the menu.

"I've been to this restaurant site when it was Elmer's and then after it became Jerry's---a few years ago.  I wasn't impressed.  About a month ago while helping our son move to an apartment nearby, we needed a lunch break and decided to come here.  My husband and I each ordered tuna salad sandwiches which sounds like a very basic mundane offering with the soup of the day.  Everything was fresh, tasty, and obviously made to order.  Our son ordered a chicken wrap with a side of sweet potato fries.  I sampled the fries, which most of the time in any eatery are frozen.  These were fantastic!  When Chef Jerry came out to  ask us how we liked the food, he made a point of saying that the fries were fresh cut and homemade.  There is an effort to provide gluten free food here and frozen fries often don't qualify.  So this way everyone can enjoy French fries.  I like this place.  It provides good, wholesome, simply prepared food at a reasonable price.  Who can argue with that?",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"If I could give zero stars for the service, I would. We're not from here but everytime we come to the area, we love visiting this restaurant.  We walked in w a family of 7, wanting to dine in but wasn't aware of the reservation process so decided to order take out instead. We wanted to order 3 separate orders since we're all staying in different hotel rooms. The manager immediately gave us a pad & pen & told us to write our own order. Super confused to why she was having us do that? Never have I gone somewhere where they told us to write our own order so I was already appalled. Then the manager reads the order & doesnt understand what we wrote ? I respond with, ""excuse me, are you the manger? This is really bad service. We come here wanting to order food & you tell us to write our own order, bc we're a big family?!"" After clearly telling her we were ordering separately. She says something in return & ends w ""...it's not nice"" so I said ""no, you're not being nice. Yes we're a big family but we are WILLING to wait knowing how busy it is."" She takes our money then yells ""it'll be 30 mins! WAIT OUTSIDE!"" While EVERYONE ELSE was waiting inside for their take out. At that point the manager was clearly picking on me & my family.   I WILL NEVER visit this place ever again. I highly recommend the owners reconsidering their manager. Apparently my family & I aren't the only ones who have dealt w the terrible service. The service after today, just WOW! We were the unlucky ones to receive the managers stress & anger. She was obviously overwhelmed w the restaurant but there should be NO reason for her attitude & bad service.   I had to ask for our money back & needed to leave immediately. Service was just TERRIBLE.   If you are the owner reading this, I highly recommend hiring new management. I'm not sure if your manager is part ownership of the restaurant?

Considering the crowd and the price per drink (our shots had New York City prices: I had three for $29!) more should have come out and/or a bit faster.  Unsure I'd be so quick to return for a happy hour, as the value isn't fantastic. On the bright side, I'd like to acknowledge the great attention we received from Renee, Nick, and Justin.

"Haha, guys!  Very funny... I just got Taco Bussed by Tampa Bay Yelpers.  That also includes being suckered into ordering the expensive $30.00 La Tablita; a platter of dry and tough cheap cuts of pork and steak with some neon yellow rice in the middle.  Lettuce on the side and a sour cream covered soggy pile of something wrapped around squishy chicken.  I am actually a fan of beef jerky, but this was not even flavorful.  Maybe you like the food here because it is Texas or California style?   Their salsa was good, but they are very stingy with the complimentary chips and salsa.  For a table of four, we asked and were never brought and second helping.  Also, very stingy with their tortillas--- I would have to face Oaxaca and pray to the Zapotec  gods for a few more tortillas, because I will not be getting them at Senor Taco.  The melted cheese covered in chorizo was covered in the typical orange layer of grease, and definitely not worth $8.95.    The only thing that I actually liked at Senor Taco was the Horchata, which was the perfect consistency and sweetness.  Overpriced, like everything else they serve at $2.00/glass with an additional charge for refills.    Sorry folks, I eat cheap and delicious Mexican food all the time south of the Skyway and cannot justify eating at Senor Taco again. I've been punked. Unfortunately, I left Senor Taco with more questions than answers.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
The good:  Friendly efficient service and a reasonably good margarita.  The guacamole was OK but nothing spectacular.  I went out on a limb and ordered the seafood fajitas.  I was intrigued because it's not something I have  seen anywhere else.  I don't think it's a very popular choice because it seemed like all the seafood came out of the frozen section and wasn't very tasteful.  Same for their interpretation of shrimp tacos.  Interesting looking now at the online menu neither option we ate is on the menu now....  Maybe they are getting things sorted.  We gave it a try but probably would go back to El Rodeo for a comparable meal.  For a tier above we'll go into Indy for La Margarita or Delicia,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Wow, I used to really like coming here but the quality and availability of ingredients and the cleanliness of this location had made this visit my last.  I have been a huge fan of pieology in the past, but starting with the removal of the build your own salad in the nice big bowls a few months back, it has all started to go downhill and fast. At this location there are also alot of specific problems.  I can't say too much about lunch, but the last few times I have come for dinner it had been around 7.  The store generally looks unkempt.  Tables are always dirty. The lemonades are  frequently low or out.  At the pizza line, the pizza peels are dirty, not even lightly wiped between uses. Many key ingredients are often out (mushrooms and basil particularly). The ingredients are applied with little care, contaminating adjacent tubs.  The store seems constantly understaffed as there are always just one or two people working. The staff appearance and and hygiene also leave something to be desired.  I mean I know they are making pizza so I don't expect them to be sparkling but they could at least manage to button their shirts, maybe wear aprons that could be changed mid shift if they get particularly dirty.  Lastly staff don't follow good food hygiene constantly touching their hair and faces and then not washing their hands.  All of this has added up to this being the last time I will go until they address these issues :'(",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"After a bumpy flight on Christmas day, The Man and I were cranky, hungry, and thirsty.  We knew it was gonna be hard to find anything decent to eat on a holiday like today but a lil digging on Yelp led us to Domenca.  Sometimes, you gotta love Yelp.  SOMETIMES....  I'm very hesitant when comes to these celebrity chef owned restaurants, Like that idiot Emril Lagasse. 1st.  The chef is NEVER there, 2nd. The attitude is never better than the attitudes you find at your local Micky Ds., and 3rd., it's always overpriced.  What a pleasant surprise... We were lucky enough to catch the Happy Hour Menu which I have to say, was quite a bargain.  Not that I'm a miser.  If all the elements are there, I have no problem dropping down bills.  Well, actually... The Man's bills.  Half off all pizzas, well drinks, beer and wine. I can dig it..  We had the charcuterie which was AWESOME.  They cure their own meats so the flavors are intense and unlike any other.  The pizzas are fantastic.  Perfectly charred crust.  Oh... and this bread that came with our charcuterie.  You gotta have it.  I'm pretty sure it's fried in bacon fat(?)  Anyway... It made this weary traveler find her 2nd wind.  We actually ended up coming back on our last day in New Orleans.  Get the Minestrone Soup.  OH MY FUCKING GOD.... It's made with duck broth.  You'll want to bathe in it.  Service was pretty good, not great but not bad.  A lil slow but it's New Orleans...  You gotta add an extra 15 minutes to anything you might expect in other cities.  ""BAM!  Take that, Emril!!!  You suck!!""",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"located in South Philly off of the cute and quaint street of Passyunk-- Stargazy brings British delights to the city of brotherly love.   a group of my friends came to this spot right when they opened at 11 am, we were welcomed with unlimited selection of baked goods and free hot tea. Just a forewarning-- Stargazy is rather small so it probably doesn't make sense to bring a party of 10 into this cafe.   Personally, I've never had British pies before and was enamored with the savory goodness of the lamb + artichoke pie and the crunchy pastry that surrounded it. As a carb lover, the soft, creamy and airy mash melted in my mouth and the parsley liquor is AMAZING. (it looks odd-- green glop on my mash potatoes but it taste like a wonderful gravy!)

"I was initially glad Rocco's Tacos and Tequila Bar took over the old geyser hangout, Blue Martini, but was a bit disappointed in what they had to offer. Rocco's Tacos is located at International Mall Plaza next to Bar Louie, Brio Tuscan Grille, Doc B's Fresh Kitchen, Taps Burger Bar Gastro Pub, Capital Grille, Cheesecake Factory, and the Pub. We initially came for their opening night which was supposed to provide complimentary salsa and guacamole for everyone. Arriving only 1 hour into the opening night, they were already out of guacamole and overcharged us for our brewskies by double. It's a good thing we called the bartender out on this. The owner was walking on the bar splashing salsa on people and pouring tequila in girls hair and dresses. Many people were not happy lol. On another occasion,  we came for the new happy hour which is 4-7pm on weekdays and includes $1 off drinks and $7 bar bites at the bar. We tried the the beef flautas with avocado ranch and salsa Chile de arbol, camarones patron which feature shrimp tortillas sautéed in tequila, Rojo Chipotle, with Padron  peppers. The shrimp tortillas are good but we had to assemble them ourselves and didn't have enough room on the plates or condiments for the tortillas. I wish they would have came prepared instead of making us do half the work! We also had the 2 Carne asada Tacos, and the jalapeño rollenos which are stuffed fried jalapeño peppers with cotija cheese lime crema avocado ranch cilantro. Each of the Bar bites isn't enough to fill you up on its own so I recommend ordering at least 2 if you're hungry. The decor for Bar taco is really cool with angels hanging from the ceiling, Mexican Star Wars art, Mexican Gouls, Mexican weapons everywhere, and they play Star Wars in the bathroom which is nice. Roccos tacos also featured a Dj booth in a Vw bus but not a lot of people ever dance here. It's more of a high spirited casual bar than a dance club. I usually come here for drinks instead of food. Usually there's a 1-2hour wait just to get seated so We just try to find spots at the bar! I'd give this place 3 stars for food and 4 stars for the crowd decor and atmosphere. It's a welcome addition to international mall and brings crowds back but I think their Orlando location is way better.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
Visit 1: Service - Waited at the outside bar near the volleyball courts for 10 minutes (while the barmaid served what appeared to be her friends by the content of the conversation she was having with them)  I then went to the inside bar to get my beer and returned to my wife who stated she STILL had not been approached.  We drank our beer and walked over to Whiskey Joes and had a wonderful time.  Visit 2: We had an expired Groupon (Paid $12 for it)  The manager would not accept the paid value stating that Groupon would refund the money regardless of me showing him the terms and conditions on the Groupon website stating that the paid value never expires and can be used at the venue.  We left after a round of drinks.  I am now dealing with them through Groupon.  How SAD!  Visit 3: Had food.  Soup had to be sent back as it was cold.

This isn't the first time I've eaten here, but I was taken aback by how good my meal was.  Even my cocktail (five berry Cosmo) was delicious.   Don greeted us, took our drink order and told us about the specials for the evening. We started with CG special shrimp.  Humongous shrimp sautéed in garlic butter. I had to dip my bread in the sauce. Our waiter Don, brought us a small sampling of their soups. Clam Chowder and Lobster Bisque. Each was just as good as the other.   On to our main course.  Majordomo decided on one of their specials.  Veal cordon blue.  Lightly breaded veal with prosciutto and cheese.  I chose veal lemonata.  Veal in a lemon butter sauce with capers.  Each came with a side of mashed potatoes and green beans.  Both of our dishes were delightful.  I am mad that I ate all of mine and did not take some home for breakfast.   Dessert?  Why, yes please.  Tiramisu, creme brûlée, cheesecake and others each sounding more delicious than the next. We decided to split the Italian cream cake.

"Being that we were on Dale Mabry and hungry last night we ventured into Vallartas. We usually go to the location on 56th street, but we weren't on that side of town and it was already 9 PM. We were both hungry. This was our second attempt eating here and we probably won't come back (we'll stick with 56th St.).   When our waiter arrived, he informed us that soup and salad was also included with our meal.  (No thanks, the soup really did not look that appetizing at 9 PM, nor would I want to eat things (that I can see) that have been out since 11 AM).  We ordered the same thing we usually get at the Temple Terrace location:  a #1 (one taco, 2 enchiladas, and beans) and a #25 (one enchilada, one chalupa, and one burrito) all filled with chicken.T hat alone is enough to fill us up, I could not even attempt to have any soup and salad, even if it looked delicious. Oh, we also ordered a side of guacamole to go with the complimentary chips and salsa.   About 15 minutes later, our food arrived. But, no guacamole- kinda wanted it to snack on with the chips BEFORE the meal. I informed the woman who brought our meal to us that we also ordered the guac. Our waiter promptly brought us a bowl of green stuff. Yes it was made with avocado, but it looked exactly like and tasted like the stuff you get from produce department of your local grocery store. It did not look or taste like traditional guacamole. Maybe I was expecting too much.   Yes, our food was hot, but it still was meh to me. My chalupa was burnt on the sides, the chicken was in huge chunks, not shredded like at Temple Terrace, and the guac. Sigh.

"I used to go to panera all the time when I was in college. Many of my friends worked there- the service was always great and while it's a bit expensive for a college student you got your money's worth in great food and a nice environment to study. So when my mom and I received a gift card to Panera we were pretty excited and ventured out one Saturday for a nice meal.  We were very disappointed. First: ordering was awkward. While we were at the front of the line about to order, the girls behind us asked if they could cut us just to get some change. We said it would be all right but then they started ordering. We told them, ""hey, you are cutting us now"" and they backed off. Okay, so maybe that was a little confusing for the cashier: not a big deal and easily corrected. Then when ordering I noticed a big sticker over the prices for the chai. The only price available was 3.99 for a large. Kind of expensive considering they don't even have any non-dairy options. I asked the cashier if the large was the only size available and she said no, that I could get a ""regular""- so I ordered it. Later I discovered that they only had the one size, which was about a 12 oz cup. So- labeled under large, which I'm guessing is about 16oz, is really a 12oz drink. Not sure why the cashier couldn't just be clear with me. Again, not a huge deal since the girl seemed new or really nervous or something. Later when she brought my bagel out, she handed me a plate with a knife, napkin, and cream cheese: no bagel. Awkward. When I went to pick up our food, there was no tray (pretty sure there used to be trays) so I had to wait for my mom to get her coffee to take the three plates to our table. While waiting the girl behind the counter just stood there with another plate staring at me as if it was so inconvenient that I was not able to pick up the food right away. I mean the counter is huge, there was no reason to stand there like that, not saying anything, not offering help.  After sitting down pretty confused and feeling uncomfortable I discovered a big chunk of bacon in my Greek salad. I'm a vegetarian, and that really destroyed my appetite. This was also where we discovered that we had just payed 3.99 for 12oz of milk mixed with a powdered chai mix.  I asked one of the attendants there for a manager- again, a confused and nervous employee... When the manager came over she was not happy. Not a single smile, not an introduction, just silence. I explained our issues. ""So what do you want to do?"" She says. Um... What? What do I want to do? You're the manager... How are you going to make this right? The mix up with the chai, like I said- not a huge deal, but she didn't seem to understand at all why I was frustrated- nor did she care. ""Okay do you want a refund?"" I would have been fine with a new salad, or even a piece of bread or something. Sure, I guess I'll take a refund. She came back with cash and a pile of change that she tossed on the table. No reciept... No eye contact. A muffled apology as she quickly walked away from our table.   I'm sorry but if I'm spending $28 on a lunch for two people I expect the service to be halfway decent and my vegetarian meal to remain vegetarian. Not the panera I knew and loved as a college kid in Michigan. Not the panera I will be returning to. Service was less than what you would even expect at McDonald's- and prices have gone way up- combos have changed- and since when does plain cream cheese cost $1.29? Already paying almost $3 for a subpar bagel ! Maybe I've now been spoiled by the lovely local bistros and cafes downtown. Such a shame to see a nice place go downhill. Place was clean though...

"Wow, best Sushi I ever ate!  After hearing about Bluefin for years, I finally was able to convince someone else to try it with me.  Thankfully, I read reviews first and knew to make reservations.  Well, for a random Tuesday night, the place was already booked until 7:30, so I'm glad I heeded advice.  Bluefin is notorious for it's shabby exterior, chic interior, so the strip mall didn't scare me.  What did scare me were the prices.  Maybe I'm just used to crummier sushi, and I understand this is all *the freshest* fish available prepared perfectly.  I would've liked to see my budget go a little further, and my companion and I left hungry.    What we did have, Miso Soup, Sushi Dinner and Rainbow Roll, were excellent.  The soup starter was fresh and not overwhelming or too salty.  The fish, literally, melted in my mouth with a dab of wasabi and a splash of soy.  The pickled ginger was used sparingly.  Ending the meal with some fresh-cut pineapple and tempurad banana (that is served so piping hot, we might have to join that Starbucks tea lawsuit for burnt tongue! So worth it though...) was a nice treat.  For $50, the meal lasted all of 30 minutes...guess we should've ordered more and expanded our budgets, so now we know.  We will be trying Bluefin again once we've saved some money in our Sushi jars at home.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

When we got up to the counter, there was a boy who was making the salads and he did something wrong and another employee belittled him in front of everyone! When I got to the register, the girl (same one with the attitude problem from the beginning) grabbed my card out of my hand, didn't make eye contact with me, and when I thanked her just rolled her eyes!

The chick who made it clearly didn't know what she was doing when it came to wrapping and putting on toppings.   Gyro itself wasn't terrible, but with the way it was made it was more of a ""pita taco with gyro ingredients"" that was half lettuce.   And the price! $7 for a gyro?   I can get a better tasting gyro from many street food vendors around Philly.   Also, it's mad loud in here from the bar upstairs, could hear half the words they were saying.

"As other reviews said, the place was crowded. We rushed over because their website said they closed at 9, but at 9:10 there were no signs of them closing. The burrito was great. Chicken was very tasty. They have a large variety of items to go on the burrito. I don't think this place compares to Chipotle at all: trust me I live in California and love Chipotle, but to compare Izzo's & Chipotle is like saying apples and oranges have many similarities when they are both just fruit! I am so glad I found this place when I was craving a burrito cuz I will definitely be back. My fiancé and I are sold on this place. The one bad side, is there chips are terrible. They mix two kinds and one of the types tastes old and stale. So, I definitely would make sure not get the chips. I'd pass on the meal deal b/c of this fact. It does sadden me that their chips suck! Overall, great burritos. Looking forward to going back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"We went to this place as a girls night out. One of our friends called to reserve a table and found out its a $400 minimum. There was 10 of us so we figured it would be fine. The atmosphere is nice and it's very cozy. Our server however was a different story. She was very nice at first and then once the party all showed up she become a little less patient. We had a hard time getting her attention to order appetizers and when someone reordered another bottle of wine that we had, she brought us a different one and then blamed it on my friend for not telling her the correct wine. Who would of thought that holding up an empty bottle of wine and asking for another of the same bottle would be confusing but whatever. The food was good and overpriced but hey...this is South Tampa. By the end of the night we were just about fed up with our servers attitude toward us when one of my friends accidentally broke the stem of her wine glass. As it broke I saw a male employee standing at the register look at her and roll his eyes. He made no attempt to help her pick up the broken pieces. She picked up the pieces and brought it to him apologized and asked for a new glass. He then told her she could only have a new glass after she paid for the one she broke. We were pretty appalled especially since our table spent well over a grand that evening. I personally will never be back.

"I really want to give a better review - because I like their pizza, but the reality is the last 7 pizzas have been burn on the toppings. I can almost understand why you may not be aware of the under-crust being overcooked; but it is unacceptable to have the meat (Canadian Bacon or Ham) black on the edged every time. I have had them recook the pizza several times but it always the same. Was in on Saturday, sat in the bar and ordered a pizza with ham (double checked and they said it was the Canadian Bacon that they frequently burn) and pepperoni. Usual result - black/burnt ham on all the edges, had to pull it off and deal with it. The waitress was nice and offered to have it recooked - but the bottom line is get your Sh%t together. If you can't figure out what the height of the heater should be - what good are you.  Will never go back and advice you find a pizza location that actually pays attention to cooking.

I ordered a veggie hoagie with LOTS of veggies only to find out when I get home that it's only lettuce, onions, cheese and bread. Do they not understand what vegetables are???

The miso soup tasted like salt water and had no visible tofu. We ordered one roll with ""crunch,"" and instead of adding it to the roll they give you a little container to I guess dip your sushi? My ""spicy girl"" roll was hardly spicy and my fish was grainy/mealy, suggesting it was poorly cut. The rolls were poorly constructed and fell apart immediately.

"I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time, especially considering its convenient location - a mere three blocks from my house. When I finally got around to trying it, it was during creative loafing's restaurant week. The aforementioned detail may have impacted my experience...  My friend and I went with the pre-fixe menu for $30 each (the price was not advertised...) and a bottle of Cabernet out of Napa. Fair pricing, nothing too fantastic nor too horrible.  Excellent vibe, nice crowd on patio and a trendy, modern feel throughout.  Food was good. Very good, was the jalapeño poppers my friend ordered and the flank steak I had. Also, the mango sorbet was served in a very cool mango shaped tin with actual mango throughout and lining the tin. Presentation was definitely thought out.  However, here is where they lose points. The Caesar salad was one of the worst I have ever had. Croutons were good but that was it. It was barely dressed...almost seemed like they tossed it in a table spoon of light vinaigrette. Tons of lettuce, no dressing but clever croutons. Overall, Carrabbas does a better Caesar, which isn't saying much.  Service....umm I have served before, so I have a bit of knowledge regarding the process; as does any regular restaurant-goer. Our server did not know anything about wines by the bottle. My friend asked for a recommendation (even offered specific key words regarding flavor, tone, etc.) and our server flat out admitted he did not know anything except for wines by the glass - not even an apology or an attempt to send someone over who could assist us in reviewing the extensive menu. I'm sorry, and I often sympathize and/or pity ignorance, but if you are going to hire a server at a wine restaurant, you should make sure that they receive a training on wine maybe?? Additionally on that note, he did his job, but he wasn't very friendly. I felt as though we were a nuisance and not very welcome. The hostess was kind to us and so was the woman who delivered our salads, but this guy just killed it for the whole place.  One last note, for the owner/serving staff: when your table has not finished their appetizers, it might be best to hold the salads; and if they're not done with the salads, you definitely should not pile on the entrées leaving each patron with three plates in front of them... The food runner simply suggested we move our plates down...wha?!!! This was the most ridiculous thing I have ever experienced. Either they've never heard of pre-bussing and timing, or they're trying to send a message to patrons who bother coming during restaurant week.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I went to Dickeys at 8 after work. I had received an email promo thought they wanted my business guess not. I know an hour before closing is iffy to start with but walking in you'd have thought this location was closed. I walked in and no employees in sight. I stood there for 10 minutes no greeting nothing. I then hear a broom on the floor I actually made eye contact with the young lady sweeping the dining room floor. She said nothing just kept sweeping. I stood there for another 5 minutes no one came to the counter. I decided hmm must be closed. I left and banged the door on the way out she watched me with her eyes my whole way to my car and made no effort to even try to come outside and fix the situation.  2-17-17: I was contacted by the owner and he was really upset about the lack of customer service.

"Stunningly horrible.   We had tried them right after they opened, we ordered a deluxe sushi for two and specifically said no eel because I am very allergic. They put 6 pieces of eel in the order. We sent the order back, they replaced it with an order including 4 pieces of eel. When they finally got the order right, the fish was semi-fresh but incredibly small cuts for the very high price. We didn't go back for about a year.   Because it had been so long, we thought that maybe they had ironed out their issues and thought that we would give them another try due to their close vicinity to us. Service was again horrible. We ordered by phone and picked it up. Over priced, fishy horrible taste to the yellowtail. I paid $16 for yellowtail sashimi which was 8 very small pieces, about 1 inch x 1 inch x 1/4 inch.

After taking our dinner orders which all consisted of items from the 1st course section and salads, our flatbread was still no where to be found.  It finally arrived around 7:45pm.
