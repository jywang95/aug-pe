This is a poorly ran restaurant. No one manages seating and the line went out the door for people paying to get out of the restaurant. Five empty tables and no one seating the long line of people waiting to eat. They need an experienced hostess. No management oversight. We asked if we could seat ourselves since we were second on the wait list and got barked at by the Vietnamese waitress to just wait.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

I'm sorry the service was horrid. The hummus  very  gritty with hardly any olive oil and the baklava was super dry hardly any honey. I may give them another chance because it was so late on Saturday.

"If I could give this place ZERO STARS I would.  We booked this hotel for a weekend trip to Tucson seeing it was decently rated on Expedia.  After reading the hotel check in policies, which only stated check in and check out times, we were SHOCKED to arrive at the hotel in the cold 30-something degree night to find the LOBBY was CLOSED!   We called the 2 different emergency contact phone numbers posted on the door and neither calls were answered.  Seeing as how our flight landed at 11:45pm we couldn't have checked in any earlier.   I've NEVER been to any other hotel/motel which was closed at any hour of the day.  It was mind-boggling to think that no one answered either calls on their emergency lines, nor did they have anyone at the front desk to check us in (when the reservations were already booked).   We were able to get a refund through Expedia, but did not get any explanation beyond the statement that this hotel apparently closes their lobby at 10pm.   This was NOT noted anywhere in our reservation information.  In fact, the emergency numbers were listed in case hotel guests got locked out of their rooms.  What happens to guest who arrive after they decide to close?  There was NO contact for us to get any assistance.  I found this to be particularly unprofessional and unacceptable for a lodging establishment.  Needless to say, we had to find different accommodations and I would NEVER recommend this establishment to anyone.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
Came here with a group of friends. The restaurant was semi busy but nothing that service couldn't handle. Atleast that's what I thought.   We were sitting in the bar area and ordered our drinks and waited probably 15 mins for the overpriced margarita pitcher that was lacking alcohol and from here it only got worse. Our entire table ran out of Chips and Salsa and were never refilled even after asking multiple times to multiple servers.   When our food finally came out it was okay but nothing I'd ever crave. I could get the same or better food anywhere else for cheaper.   Toward the end of dinner we were going to try and order another pitcher of margaritas before heading to the bars but the server just never came back after dropping the checks off the same time our food was dropped off.   Some of the worst service I've ever received.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"My husband and I visit Longwood Gardens yearly-- we love it. We were excited to find such a nice hotel nearby. A week before our visit, a snow storm was predicted. my husband called to cancel the reservation and the Inn refused. So now a school teacher and a mechanic are out $300.00 because we cannot make the 9 hour drive in the snow. That pretty much ruins anything we might be able to do on our spring break. We are SO VERY DISAPPOINTED. We would likely have come back year after year, but instead, we will recommend that our entire sustainable garden club NEVER make a reservation with this inn.

"I can see why this place has 2 stars!! This was not my normal location, but I recently downloaded the app, and it had a deal for a small blizzard, and this location was on the way home. First, I sat in the drive-thru for 15min with two cars in front of me. I ordered a small blizzard and a sundae and when I got to the window I showed her my promotion code for the deal. She looked at me confused and called over another employee and that employee proceeded to tell me that this location doesn't accept the coupons/ promotions that are on the app, & their system isn't set up for it! So they couldn't honor the promotion, so I left the drive thru after 15 min with only 1 item.. because it's not my fault that the app allows you to select that location for promotions and they don't have the proper POS system to honor the promotions and provide quality customer service.. the real kicker is the bottom on of the receipt states ""Check in for sales and coupons"".. what a joke!!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I dont write Yelp reviews often, but sometimes I just feel the need to let people know about a stellar or less than satisfactory experience... I live in the neighborhood and was excited to hear about and see Pizza Brain become a reality! I love me a good slice and the pizza scene in Fishtown is notoriously weak! Anyhow, I wanted to like this place even before I experienced their pizza and wacky collection of pizza memorabilia. Sadly, Pizza Brain was a major disappointment.  The decor is fun, you feel like you are in the middle of a Coney Island pizza freak show or something! There are no tables, you stand at a counter to eat. Fine for a quick lunch, but I wouldnt recommend it for dinner. The pizza itself is good, nothing incredible, but above average. To my surprise, they only had 2 options for slices- a basic plain slice w/ a bit of fresh basil and a slice with goat cheese and sundried tomatoes. I opted for 2 plain slices.   Slices were $3.5 a piece (regardless of plain vs. toppings) and $2 for a soda, so lunch was $9 bucks. It took nearly 15 minutes to receive my slices that were just being reheated, and whoever was working the oven could barely figure out how to get the slices out of the oven! This is not rocket science fellas! When I finally got my slices, I was bummed at how small they were given their taxed price. I immediately felt ripped off! Also, watching ""friends"" of the owners walk out with free slices (who came in after me and got their food before me) did not help me to enjoy my overpriced slices. To put it in perspective, a single slice of Lorenzos is easily larger than my two slices combined and also less expensive than a single slice here!   If that wasn't enough, when I asked for some red pepper flakes I was unapologetically told no! and was practically scoffed at! I guess Im not a purist pizza eater! Also, while I was eating my pizza someone who was working there kept sweeping around me and up in my ""comfort zone"". At one point he asked me to move over while I was eating so that he could sweep the area where I was standing! To me, this is a no ""BRAINER""- wait till the customer finishes eating and then go ahead and clean up!  I left Pizza Brain with a really bad taste in my mouth about the experience and also still hungry! If you dont mind overpriced novelty hipster ego pizza then you will probably love this place. In my opinion, they have a lot of work to do if they are going to make it! I will give them 6 months to get their act together before I go back. In all honestly, I'm not sure that I am even hip enough to be eating at Pizza Brain. In the meantime, I will continue to go to Rustica, Francos, or Tacconellis for a good slice in the area.  ---------------------------- As an update- I give the owners credit for reaching out to me after reading my review. They were very apologetic and even offered me some free pizza. They explained that they are still ""working out the kinks"" which is understandable, but in my opinion there is no excuse to make a customer feel uncomfortable!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"We came to the restaurant on 8/3/2014 with our entire family (our immediate family and in-laws). They were out of everything from apple juice to beer to kids meals. Then the waiter opens with telling us whatever you want we can prepare it for you bc we make it fresh and then the waiter tells us the shrimp is pre-prepared with beer battered crust so we cannot have the shrimp just grilled.  (Fish taco dinner) The sever then tells us that the manager will come and talk to us, bc we waited for about 30 minutes for a drink that never came bc they were once again out of it. He never did come over, He did walk by and glance at our table. So I got up and walked to the hostess stand and I approached him with our concerns.   First he said there was nothing to apologize for besides the fact that they were out of a Kids meal we requested. That he was in the process of ordering it now???? Instead of coming to our table to show GOOD customer service, he was busy ordering food for the restaurant?  He was SO rude and had the worse customer service.  We actually left before we ate bc he was so rude! This restaurant has good potential if it wasn't for awful management! Lack of food and customer service is all due to the management, this restaurant will continue to have bad reviews and will most likely not last if they don't change the management!

"PLEASE DON'T EAT HERE!!!  I live in the Florida pan handle and I brought my family here while they were visiting from up north. The ""manager"" Kathy was our server. We asked to sit upstairs and were told no right off the bat, not a great start but ok. When we ordered our drinks we notified our waitress that we would be on separate tabs, she didn't like that. After receiving our food she quickly noticed one person in our party was missing his food. She apologized and said she would be right back with it. After going to her register and putting in the order, we watched her go to the kitchen and tell the chef that she needed a rib eye cooked medium (exactly what he ordered). The steak came out as we finished our meal, after we said to cancel the order. Kathy told us that we needed to pay for the steak and the mandatory 18% gratuity. We went back and forth for a while, she raised her voice at us and we left. We paid our bill because we're good people and we paid our 18% gratuity because ""it's the law"".

"I have heard SOOOO much about how good Tony Lukes was,  so I figured I would give them a try.  What a disappointment!!!! I understand this is not fine dining,  but a customer should not see the cook screwing around on his cell phone and idly walking around when there is a line of customers waiting for their food. Then to see him not change his gloves after handling his cell phone,  was outrageous.  Do they not know that phones are one of the highest germ carriers? I am not germaphobic, but why are you wearing the gloves in the first place?   On to the food... I know they are known for their cheese steaks,  but I saw this item that caught my interest, and figured I would try it for lunch, a pazotti combo. The pazotti is a infusion of a panzerotti and a cheese steak.  Nice idea,  bad execution.  The filling looked gray, the dough was under cooked, and they were loaded with grease. The fries were supposed to be fresh cut,  but I distinctly tasted freezer burn on the fries. My stomach was still rolling hours later.

"i love surrey's. i first fell in love with the location in the garden district, but the uptown location is closer to my house. actually it's right around the corner. so convenient. so delicious.  that being said, i will be taking my brunch business elsewhere from now on. i attempted to dine uptown this past saturday. there was a 15 minute wait, which was expected. my boyfriend and i planned to go next door to le bon temps and get some champagne and make mimosas while we waited with the delicious juice at surreys. yum! what could be better than that on a saturday morning? i can't think of anything.  unfortunately for us, the employee behind the juice bar refused to serve my boyfriend 2 glasses of juice while we waited for our table because ""it would take away from the customers who were dining."" ummm, ok. that's understandable....i guess. annoying, but whatever.  THEN.....THEN....while we are standing there, lamenting about having to go mimosa-less while we waited, another man waiting in line goes inside. and what does he come back out with? well, a big tall glass of juice, of course.

The service in the bar area sucks! The bar tender is Great but there is a ton of peeople here and it takes 30-35 minutes to get a drink. The bar tender is not the problem.

The pasta comes straight out of a box, nothing fresh about it. The chicken must have been frozen and from Sam's club, sauce definitely out of a jar.

"Went to the lunch buffet and it was the worst I ever had. There were only some scraps of food left to choose from and they took time to bring out more food. If you are doing buffet service then you should make sure you replenish the trays often as needed so customers are not waiting. That defeats the purpose of the buffet being quick and easy.   Even if the trays were full of food, it would still be a low review as the food was not good at all. Not many good options and the ones they had were not the best choice. Only one boneless meat option and that chicken tasted like rubber. All the other chicken options had bone-in and there was hardly any meat on there mostly bone. They didn't serve any other meat options...where is the Chicken Tikka and Lamb which are usual good staples of Indian buffets.  Poor food, arabic music playing with an indian/asian theme to the decor....doesn't seem like they know what they are trying to have the place be. Instead its a mix of everything which doesn't work.I don't know how this place has so many good reviews..maybe a lot of people who don't know what Indian food should be. This was bland and disappointing. As an Indian i have eaten maybe buffets over the years and this was the worst one ever. Even the desserts were poor...who messes that up?! On top of everything else the buffet price was more than I ever spent of a buffet. Even the good ones downtown/west philly/northeast and much better in price and quality. Surprised that this place is still open...I have seen better places than this come and go.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"OMG!  They are so slow here.  I've tried them for breakfast and lunch and I have never had fast service.  Stopped in for lunch a few weeks ago and it took them 30 minutes to make two Cuban sandwiches.  If they were busy at the time I could understand a delay but there was one table with four people and one table with another couple for a total of 8 people (including me and my husband).  There were at least 4 staff ""working"".  Decided to try them again for breakfast this time I've now been waiting 20 minutes for a 3 egg omelet to go.  Ridiculous. The food really isn't good to begin with but add a 20 minute wait on top of poor quality and it's a recipe for disaster.

"This small restaurant in the westend has been around for a while but nothing made me want to go try it out until recently since my parents saw some advertisement.  I definitely have not been missing out!  The decor needs updating and a new paint job but the chairs all seems newer so it was comfortable.  My mom and I arrived around 6:45 for dinner, we were seated immediately.  There were only two waitresses working and seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with the service.  The restaurant was only half full but there were take-out orders with people coming in and out.  One waitress was at the front collecting money from people, taking/getting take-out orders and cleaning tables.  The other was bringing food from the kitchen, taking orders and very cranky.  We had to ask her for a teapot of hot water three times and our food arrived after 40 minutes.  We ordered the beef brisket and tendon hotpot and tofu and assorted meat hotpot with steamed rice. The prices were reasonable and the portions were large but just tasted okay.  While eating, we saw a customer return for a second time for his take-out order which was still not ready!  He seemed angry and told the waitress they said 25 minutes.  She did apologize and went into the kitchen and came out with his order.  There was a larger group of family members who came in after 7:30 who must have pre-ordered their food since they got their food before mine.  There were a few kids at the table who asked for more rice and the waitress shouted ""okay, last time"".  I wondered what that was about since they were customers who was going to pay for the food!

When we finally got a seat, everything was sticky, dirty, and grungy, and the coffee was weak and watery. My mother in law ordered a rare steak with her eggs, and when it arrived, it was well done. Not even a hint of pink. They replaced her steak, but that steak was still medium well at best. The worst of all - I ordered eggs Benedict, and was halfway through eating it when I discovered a long, dark hair sandwiched between the meat and eggs.

To the point where my husband and I were actually sick today because of them not cooking the food. There were no toppings on the chalupas, no hot sauce in the bag, the shells were not crunchy; they tasted like someone made them at 9pm and then kept them out all night. We paid for spicy ranch and didn't get it, honestly, I don't ask for much at 1am, but it was just so horrible last night I can't be quite about it.

"I understand this is a buffet so the food is not going to be top quality, but for the money they charge, it should be more than just a step above pig slop.   EVERYTHING comes from a can, and the food is so over cooked it is gross even looking at it.  I tried the chicken wings they have been advertising on TV lately.  The chicken was over cooked and rubbery.  The ""sauce"" they use on the chicken was watery and for the most part tasteless.   I tried the new ""Chinese"" choices they  had available.  The noodle dish they had I literally took one bite and almost threw up.  I am not exaggerating here, I am serious.  It had a foul taste.  The other food in that section was over cooked and covered up loads of sauce to hide how bad it is.    My daughter got the Mac and Cheese and the noodles had been so over cooked that the noodle was beginning to separate because of been boiled for about 20 minutes too long.  My other daughter got he mashed potatoes, and the cook made them from a can because the potatoes were almost translucent which means they failed to follow the directions on the can and used too little potato flakes.  Every single item they had out like fried okra, green beans, chicken (so over fried I could actually see burn marks on the over breaded chicken) was so badly prepared and looked revolting.    I did eat the crab salad, but do not think they prepared it, it was some kind of pre-made stuff.  The strawberries were great and the fruit in the salad section, which most of it came from a can like the peaches and pears, were okay also.  I did eat a steak they made but it too was over cooked.  It was dry and basically felt like I was eating a piece of shoe leather.  I even drowned it in the A-1 sauce, but it didn't help.  I also had the corn, that was okay, but was also from a can, nothing fresh.  The only other thing I ate there was the fresh yeast bread rolls.  I had to wait about 20 minutes for them to put them out, but they came out hot and tasted really good with the honey spread butter.  The kids did enjoy the cotton candy from the dessert bar and the desserts looked okay, but I skipped that section and stuck with the strawberries; I didn't want to take a chance and get some kind of food poisoning.  Speaking of which, the dinner had a very bad effect on my wife, she ended up having to run the toilet and expel the waste of dinner because it made her stomach gurgle.  She ended up having a bad night and her stomach didn't recover for a number of hours.  Obviously, I will never eat at another Golden Corral as long as I live.

Had a reservation for Mother's Day for 7 people and restaurant failed to inform not only us but all of their guests of a mandatory buffet that was set at a steep price per person.

Many parties that made reservations had older men or women who would not be able to maneuver a buffet (walkers and canes etc.). Woman's (we speculated she was the cantankerous wife of the owner) response was horrible and embarrassing to watch. After witnessing how she handled these situations I will not be coming back.

"Dishonest takeout  pricing. Let me start by saying that I hate to write this review but I must give a serious warning to anyone who will listen.   I have been getting takeout from this place for several years.  I stop by once or twice a week for a quick dinner after work as it on my route home.  The workers know me and for the most part are quite friendly. The lady (One of the owners, I assume) that greets people at the door even grabs a takeout box for me as I come in the door due to my usual routine.  I have always noticed that regardless of what I get (priced  $4.99 by the pound takeout), It always totals in the  $6.50 or $7.50 range. This is even if I get just a small amount.  It was not until this week when I was in line with two other individuals who had takeout boxes that noticed a serious problem. I saw them at the buffet/bar and both filled their boxes much more and much heavier than mine. They were Caucasian (I am African American).  They were charged much less per pound than me. Both paid about $5.75 or so for full boxes.  When  my box was weighed...once again.. $7.65 !!??  My box weight showed just over a pound. (1lb-2oz to be exact).  I asked why the previous couple paid less for more food and I was looking at the scale weight each time. The cashier/owner lady (previously mentioned) smiled and pretended to not understand the question. I then asked her to weigh the box again, and why I was paying more than the posted $4.99 per pound.  She would not comply and just asked for the payment card.  I'm not saying this is necessarily a racial issue and not claiming such-but not ruling it out. It could simply be that I've been stupid enough to over pay for years and I'm a fool for trusting this restaurant without questioning the pricing for such a long period of time.  The moral of this story is to check the weight of your box and what you are paying. The food is not bad (not great either).  They are very dishonest.   The place is always empty for a reason.  They have lost another loyal customer and I am really hurt at the deception and possible racism of this place.   Watch yourself.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Places one glass then the the next slips from her grasp and falls right on my lap. I am now drenched in ice cold water. She is apologetic and goes to get me 2 napkins to dry off with (ok?) The GM comes over to the table and instead of asking what he can do to help he cracks a joke about how the rain and me being wet! I asked him if he thought this was funny and he left without comment. After that the waitress decided our table wasn't worth her time and there was no attempt to rectify the situation.

"If you look at my ratings I only rate restaurants I like.  This place made me write my first negative post.    The place is huge and was empty, the hostess gave me an attitude because I asked to sit outside.  Then it took 10 minutes for a waitress to come over.  When she came over she was friendly.  I work in Astoria and grew up eating at a lot of Greek restaurants.  The one thing that is consistent in every Greek restaurant I have ever been to including my trip to Greece.  When my daughter asked for a chicken kabob the waitress said it came with some veggie and potato.  My daughter said no thank you I just want the chicken.  Waitress said I don't think we can do that...I said why?  She offered to ask the chef, she came back and said sorry he can't do that.  So I said just bring the chicken don't worry about the veggie and potato.  She said she had to charge the same price.  I said no problem, she comes back and said you have to have the veggie and potato.  I said we will pay for them but it's a waste to make them and bring them out.  She told me that if we wanted that we have to take the veggie and potato.  This ordeal took 35 minutes so we finally say just bring it out.  It took 30 minutes for the food to come out and it was not very good.  I ordered the octopus and it was like rubber.  The fried calamari was ok at best.  We had to get up and go inside to the bartender to tell him we were done and wanted a check.  Music was blasting inside like it was a club.  They did have a belly dancer that's why the 1 star.

"I write this review because of the way I and my family was treated here on Mother's Day. I purchased two coupons for half off two appetizers, two entries, two margaritas, and a dessert to share from Travel Zoo. Immediately upon getting here the waitress (wearing a see through dress) takes the coupon before seating us. We get our meal that honestly was good, just not the greatest I've ever had and being from Los Angeles, I know great Mexican food...this wasn't it. The drinks were okay, but a little too funky for most everyone at the table. The problems I had came to the THREE HOUR wait for food. It's annoying especially when people that came in after us got their food quicker, chatted for awhile after, and where gone well before we even hit the ""dessert"". Then the big shocker of the waitress handing me two separate new  bills for the mandatory gratuity (18% percent of what the bill WOULD HAVE BEEN if we had ordered with out the coupon in effect). Even though the menu said mandatory gratuity on 7 or more people (we had six), they still charged us AND lied about the number of people mandatory. I basically paid what I would have paid if I hadn't used a coupon for food that was sub par (and if you think otherwise, you need to leave pretentious bourgeois places like that behind and go eat where local Mexicans like to eat) and service that was horrible. Why in hell would I pay ANY kind of tip for three hours of just sitting there? Also, when I checked my copy (I printed more than one lady) back at home, I realized she'd lied again: the coupon only says tax and gratuity not included...nothing about having to pay an inflated gratuity. To top it off, if you decide to wear something see through...please Lord, make it something people would want to see. Terrible end to a great trip up the coast. Thank you Blue Acrappy for almost ruining that and Mother's Day (my mom was furious).

"We went to this place thinking we would have a relaxed evening but had no idea they would price gouge us for 3 little piece of meat. Where do you order extra meat and get charged nearly $7 for 3 little pieces of meat you can bearly taste?   The pesto sauce was more prominent in the dish than the 3 little pieces of meat we added. Keep in mind that the calzon is about $15 full price and almost $7 in happy hour but when you order ""half meat"" or so they call it, they charge you more than the calzone itself, so you pay more than full price anyway. No where on the menu did they mention that they would price gouge you for ""half meat"" which was extremely small. It should be listed or the server should make you aware of it. If you want the full meat order then you have to pay 150% more than the calzone itself. Which tells me that they are short on their math skills as well, since a full order of meat is nearly $11 then half shouldn't be $7. I'm sure smart people know what ""half"" means.  When we brought this up to the server he looked puzzled and confused as if this was some sort of scam that he was not aware of. Then he went to confirm with his manager who i assume was the skinnier guy with a beard and roughed up look. Then the guy came to our table to try and make his case. When he knew he didn't make sense he began to insult us and said that ""this is not a subway"", so I responded with ""this is not the Ritz Carlton either"".   If they have a serious problem with the happy hour prices they're providing, then they shouldn't offer happy hour in the first place, and they shouldn't insult their customers when they are made aware of their exorbitant extra prices for items you can bearly see in your dish. Maybe they really don't want to provide happy hour prices and that's why they price gouge, to end up charging you full price anyways. I've never heard of a extra meat charge that cost more than the plate itself.   The manager, or whoever that guy is needs better customer relashionship and service skills before he has the audacity to opens his mouth to insult his customers. If i knew i was going to a wanna be ""Ritz Carlton"" i would have made another choice and so should you. So since they felt comfortable with their scam, i felt comfortable not paying a tip and saved $3 minimum after my tip was omited since i always tip $10 or more, never less.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Some time later, out comes a spring roll, which sits alone on the table - no water, tea, beer, napkins, or utensils.

"We have been going to CDBs for 25+ years. On 12/04/15 we had a terrible experience. We arrived at 3:10 and were told that lunch menu ended at 3. That was ok because our groupon said ""dinner only"". When we got our sandwiches we noticed how they had cut back in the meat on the hard hat special and the eggplant grinder was also with less eggplant (bread was same size). When we went to pay and use our groupon (after 4pm) the waitress said the manager, Curtis Sails, would not let them take groupons until after 4. When he came to our table, with an attitude, and I showed him the groupon which said ""dinner only"" and nothing about 4 pm, he said my groupon was wrong. He ""has seen them that say 4"". I told him dinner starts at 3 as is stated on the menu. He said ""not until 4"". He was rude and arrogant and said call groupon and cancel it if I wanted to.  Groupon was SO apologetic and said he was wrong. There are NO active groupons for CDB that say ""after 4"". They gladly refunded all of my money and encouraged me to write a review on Yelp instead of groupon because it would last longer. Why would a manager ruin a 25+ year customer relationship over 8$?

"We placed an online order at 6:44 pm on 30 Nov 20 and were given an estimate of 75 minutes for delivery, which was acceptable.  At 8:30 pm, there was still no sign of our order, so we called the KFC inquiry line to ask about where our order was.  We were left on hold for almost 15 minutes with no answer (or delivery) forthcoming, so we decided to look up the restaurant's number and inquire with them directly.  When we finally got a hold of them, they told us that our order was there and waiting for us.  When we inquired about why it hadn't been delivered yet, there seemed to some initial confusion about whether it was supposed to be delivered and, after a pause, we were then told that it would be ""on the next batch out.""    We made a second call to the restaurant about where our order was at 9:15 pm, 30 minutes after the first inquiry was made and, after asking when our order was due to arrive, were hung up on.  We tried to make three successive calls, the first never being answered and the second and third ringing busy.  I was then obliged to go to the restaurant in person to demand an answer about our meal and why it was never delivered.  When I arrived, I was again greeted with confusion over it needing to be delivered.  After determining that this was a complete waste of time, I demanded my money back, but was told that because it was an online order the best they could do for me was refund the delivery and tip.  Finally, at approx. 9:35 pm, almost three hours after it was originally ordered, and almost 90 minutes after the original delivery estimate, I finally had my order--which I had to pick up myself.  Suffice to say, this is totally and absolutely unacceptable.  We paid for delivery, with the expectation that our supper would at least be close to being on time.

"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Last night  I decided to finally order some Love & Honey Fried Chicken. I wanted to try it for months now. So since I'm in the hospital  and I could order it using Uber Eats I did. When I got the chicken I was so excited to finally taste this chicken that has all of these rave reviews. When I opened the box of chicken it looked like it was going to be delicious and flavorful. It was still hot which was a plus. Unfortunately that's where everything went down hill. When I ripped into my chicken breast I noticed that there was so much fat on the chicken. The skin underneath the crust of the chicken was rubbery and thick. Also there was something ""slimy"" for lack of a better word on the chicken as well. Not to mention that this chicken was under seasoned. It was bland. No flavor what so ever. So basically it was just a pretty unseasoned piece of fat slime chicken. Now I did order the key lime pie. The pie was very delicious. It was the only part of the meal I enjoyed.

All told, it took 40 minutes for mine as well, but again, no big deal. For as packed as it was, I expected it to be this phenomenal sushi restaurant I'd been sleeping on. Nope. Not at all. The two rolls I tried were comparable to Bellevue Kroger Sushi section; nothing stood out, nothing wowed, and it was soggy to boot. Whatever, I was starving so I ate it. Which leads me to my bathroom four hours later. Stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, you name a symptom of food poisoning and I've got it. This Yelpers first impression was definitely one I want to forget. Yikes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"It could be a freak incident but I have never (and I eat out 5-6 days a week) in all my life had bad Chinese food ........until now!   Nasty food.   Fried rice with freezer burn on the vegetables..... vegetables that looked dirty, after being cooked, mushrooms from a can and rubber shrimp.    To top it off my soup I ordered had a chlorine taste to it.    Either the pot used wasn't rinsed properly or the water used for the broth was tap water that was chlorinated  or something.   I had both people with me try the broth and everyone said it tasted like chlorine. We left politely and took all the food to go and quickly found a trash container to dispose of it.   It was all wrong.  It's hard to eat and before my 7th or 8th bite I didn't feel well.  I stopped and we all decided to quietly leave and take the food so we didn't offend.   I'll never go back.

Twice we went out fries were soggy and chilly. My burger was not even hot or warm. This back on Jan Feb I blew it off as it being  cold out outside. This past Wend 3/9/216 it was hurbule. We asked for fresh fries told the cashier about the fries being soggy cold. So she apologizes says she tell the guy to put fresh ones down. The fries were ok at least not soggy. But the Niger was so spicy and I ordered a dibble Swiss and am cheeses Niger. My sons chicken nuggets were cold. So we will no longer be going there. What ever happened to this place to get food so bad. We have been going here since they opened the food use to be hot fresh and great. What ever happened to the freshness of food to the cold chicken spicy Niger and wilted fries. Now the kids at taking the orders are very nice and try to make it right. This place need management skills where you tell your people fresh means fresh NOT COLD NOT SPICY AND NOT WILTED. This use to be an awesome place to eat but I will not be back.

"I'm sorry to say that my first time here will be my last.  Since I lived with my husband's family in Mexico City and am accustomed to authentic Mexican cuisine, I can say that the food here is disappointing, at best. It was the typical food found in just about any average Mexican restaurant here in the US. Not bad, but not the delicious Mexican cuisine I've been craving. The chicken enchiladas and the flautas made with carnitas were stingy with the meat. I ordered the aguas rather than bottled soft drinks and again was disappointed. The agua de sandia (Watermelon) and the agua de horchata both had way too much sugar which made them difficult to enjoy. St Petersburg and Tampa have an abundance of Mexican restaurants. Chile verde will have to step up its game if it wants to compete with them.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Appalled by the food and service here. I had nowhere to eat at 3pm because most other restaurants aren't open until 4 so i decided to try pho cali. As an avid pho eater, i'm very critical about how the pho tastes so upon eating here, I have never been so disappointed. First of all, the broth is unbelievably watered down to the point that i'm just drinking boiled water. What makes pho amazing is the broth so if thats watered down and contains no flavor, the meat and noodles mean absolutely nothing. Not only was the broth awful, the noodle-to-meat ratio was way off balance. In smaller than usual bowls that are only filled halfway, it contained about 6 small squared pieces of meat and a big handful of noodles. They seem to be very stingy with their ingredients and thats not any way to run a restaurant. although I have only seen and tasted 2 different types of pho, they were completely identical to every last ingredient; I ordered raw beef and it was well-done. Lastly, id like to add that none of the workers said a single word to us besides, ""ready?"" I understand the language barrier as immigrants, but customer service is the same all around the world, communication is key.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"What.a.nightmare.  I'm not even sure where to begin.  I know we came during a festival.  My family was prepared to wait and knew the food would take a bit of time as well.  The way we were treated by our waitress was UNACCEPTABLE.  I could rattle off one thing after another as far as her attitude and lack of aptitude for her job.  Mind you.  I've been bartending/serving/managing restaurants from coast to coast for nearly 20 years and currently run a successful bar in downtown San Diego.  I know how things operate and also can understand stress levels among staff when an event is going on.  Like I said I won't even go into the details of the shitty service.  Several tables around us simply got up and left.  People who stayed and finally managed to get the hell out were saying ""good luck"".  Should have headed their warnings.  HOWEVER we being a patient group, stayed.  Once we finally were able to get water.  Then finally able to order.  Eventually eat.  And then try to eat again when our app came out 30 min later.  I was at least thankful that she didn't throw the bread on the table like she did to the family behind us.  With a dry mouth I decided to save my server a step (since she want going to come by anyway) and pay out at the register.  I knew she wasn't going to come by because she said ""I'm over it... if the owners don't care I don't care""Try to pay.  Credit card machine is down.  Ok, that happens.  I've been in that situation.  Guy in front of me goes to the ATM gets cash.  ""Sorry we don't have change"".   Welllll how is someone supposed to pay?  Ok.  That happens too.  I get it.  Oh!  Credit card machine is back up!  Cool.  Lets all pay and get out.    I had SEVERAL added items to my check.  Once we got all of that figured out.  And I payed my nearly $100 tab I was happy to get the f* out.  Not ONCE did anyone apologize, the entire staff was rude and incompetent.  I even said to our server who was a complete jerk ""sorry you're having a bad shift"".  Still, wasn't going to ""ask for a manager"" or complain.  It is what it is.  However, by a stroke of un-luck... I go to turn around and tell my group that I just paid for it all so we could leave faster ... a guy in a polo shirt is right there.  Looks like a manager.  ""Are you the manager""?  Thinking how the hell is this asshole just standing here watching the restaurant go down in flames?!  ""No, I'm the owner"".  Spits the tomato out that he's eating at my feet and says ""Whats the problem""?  Immediately could tell that he is HAMMERED.  Drunk.  I work 40+ hours behind a bar.  I know the difference between salty, buzzed & hammered.  Now I feel bad for the staff.  I said, ""the problem is my family just spent 2.5 hours eating for 4 cokes water a couple of burgers, hotdogs and some mussels.  Unacceptable rude rude rude service, an incorrect check and not one apology"".  ""How are YOU the owner and you're just standing here eating a tomato like you don't care""?  Was so disgusted.  Tried to just walk away b/c as I know from experience there is ZERO point in trying to argue with a heavily intoxicated person.  He GRABS my shoulder and gets 3 inches from my face screaming about how I don't know how to run a restaurant in a drunken rant.  I told him to first of all NOT touch me & secondly I'm not trying to get anything from you.   Introduced myself shook his hand and tried to walk away.  Grabs me again and starts following me back to my familys' table yelling.  I turn around and said please DO. oT come near my family as we had children with us & I also didn't want to upset my Mom or cause a bigger scene.  Well, he did.  As I'm trying to get him to focus on me instead of yelling at them my family scoots out the door.  As my sister is telling him to back off and stop yelling.  SO.  Kind sir.  Maybe next time accept that things weren't running smoothly, offer an apology, staff appropriately during large events & if you can't don't get so sloppy drunk that you can't jump in and get your hands dirty to keep things running smoothly & MOST importantly don't GRAB patrons arms and rants through the restaurant to cause a major scene (mind you I was trying to calmly walk away and did not raise my voice til he started following me screaming) maybe your staff wouldn't hate you so much and wouldn't be so pissed off that they don't care about doing an ok job.

"Reluctantly came to this Qdoba on November 25th. We walked in and the two guys on the line did not have their masks over their nose. As of this posting, one of them does and the other one did leave. Went to go use the restroom and they had an empty toilet paper dispenser with three toilet paper rolls on the floor. And a unopened toilet paper roll on the ground. I used that to dry my hands because there's no soap and no paper towels. Overheard the manager telling him to go clean the bathrooms and he was very adamant about saying he did and didn't even want to go do it. He had gloves on and went to the women's restroom came out with a bag walked towards the counter proceeded to talk to a customer that walked in for some food, and he grabbed the food and gave it to her without changing his gloves or washing his hands!

"What is wrong with this Krystal burger??!! I think this is the worst service I've ever gotten at ANY fast food restaurant EVER! We pull in and there are already 3 cars in the drive thru in front of us so we're waiting to place our order but no one ever comes on the intercom. 5, 7, 8 minutes go by and we see the man in the car at the window is irate. Still, no one comes to the speaker or window. The same irate man gets out of the car and tries to look inside to see what's going on. Apparently the speaker is out so you have to place your order and pay at the window and it looks like there's only one employee. The employee tells the irate guy to pull his car to the side so the next car can pull up. The 2nd car sits there for about 5 min. then 7 min. and no one ever comes to the window to take his order. By now it's been at least 15 plus min. since we've been there so who knows how long the others have been there. All of a sudden the 2nd car screeches his tires really loud and speeds off. Since it was really late at night and the dining area was already closed I decided to call the location to find out what was going on. Of course I call and someone keeps hanging up on me. After he left car 3 left and then we left. If they had just put a sign over the speaker saying ""out of order &  BTW it's gonna take 30 min. to get your food.

"First and foremost, I love St Pete and the entrepreneur spirit that it has. It is my utmost desire that all businesses grow and thrive.   With that being said, just coming back from my first experience with 2nd & Second, this was the most disappointing dining experience I've had in my 4 years of living here.   For starters, the poor host seemed to be absolutely drowning, between trying to clear and clean tables, take names and seat people, I was tremendously confused why there was no one busing tables. In fact, there was a manager standing behind the counter the whole time we were there, and instead of busing tables that looked gross, he just stood there, chatted with customers, and occasionally ran food out to the wrong tables.   Our server was an incredibly nice lady who was a victim of the circumstance of a poorly run restaurant, who apologized more times than I could count for the wait time (which was just fine, I can't remember the last time I didn't wait on Sunday morning at a diner) and food serving time.   Once the food was served, the amount of homefries we were given was laughable. I know that may sound ridiculous, but it was served on a massive plate, only to have the homefries maybe take up a 1/4 of 'their side' of the plate, with the BLT+AE on the other side. Also, the homefries tasted like the previously frozen (wether or not they were I don't know) kind I was served at camp when I was a kid, as did the extremely burnt bacon. The BLT+AE was absolutely delicious though, so big win there.    I understand that this is their opening week, but I have been to so many restaurants opening weeks, and none were even remotely as bad as this.   My advice to management is you need to get your hands dirty. If you set up your staff so they are overwhelmed due to too few on the floor, lack of training, or whatever, it is absolutely unacceptable to stand behind the counter and survey your kingdom while they are trying as hard as they can to provide a pleasant dinning experience.   In the land of diner options in St Pete, 2nd & Second has a long way to go before doing battle with polished behemoths like Trips Diner.   I'll give it another shot at some point, but for now, my suggestion is to give them some time to hone in their operation.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Sadly, I would not recommend to eat here. Personally my food was very good however, the rest of my parties food was mediocre and burnt. To begin with we were Sat at 1:55 and only received 2 of our parties food at 2:56. Before that as we were sitting and waiting for food (we were Sat in front of the expo area) I noticed a burger had been sitting in the window for AT LEAST 20 mins, turns out it was one of two plates meant for our table. And on top of that, one of those 2 plates that were ready had burnt pancakes on them, one of the servers delivering such pancakes even before placing the food down told my guest that the kitchen could remake the pancakes if needed. Finally, the rest of the food came a delicious breakfast pizza and okay shrimp and grits. We asked our server for an explanation as to why so long of the wait and his explanation was ""It's Sunday Brunch so everyone waits."" However, because we were sitting so long we had lots of time to observe guest around us and guests that were waiting to be Sat. Guest that were waiting while we were getting our order taken, were at this point eating and LEAVING before us.

If you're looking for a good filet try claim jumper, mortons steak house, Ruth Chris and many more. Dissapointed.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Um yeah... this was the worst experience I've ever had dealing with a restaurant.  I mean, it was so awful, I would never ever recommend anyone have to go through what I did.  Like the other people said, its all true.  Menu slipped under my door, ordered pizza, told me it would be 45 mins.  One hour passes, I call--""It'll be there in 15 mins.""  Two hours passed...I call.  Guy on the other line cussing, saying ""Stupid Americans..."" or something like that.  My jaw drops.  I've never experienced anything like this.  I say, cancel my order and he responds, it will be 15 mins.  I say, cancel more order!  He responds, you can't wait 15 mins?  I said I'd been waiting two freakin hours!  I give him one more chance, just to see if someone will actually show up...and low and behold...no one shows up.  Call back one more time, and tell him he better not charge my card, and he hangs up cussing.  I mean, this was beyond amazing.

A few minutes later we were greeted by a very rude lady who just walked up to our table and with no hello or anything said ""you drank it so I am not taking it off the bill"" and walked away.  I can only assume the waitress just went over and told this lady, manager or whatever she is, we did not want to pay for our wine which was not the case at all.

"One of things I was most excited about for my return trip to NOLA was a return trip to Marigny Brasserie.  I had such an amazing time the last time I was there, that I could not wait to return.  Though this place is out of the way from where we were staying and from anything else we wanted to do, we made the ""trek"" to Frenchmen St.  Immediately as we walked in, I noticed that things were different.  Sure we were there on Tuesday night, but where was the lovely, candlelit, cozy ambiance I remembered from last time?  It looked run down and cold under the harsh lighting.  Also, our waitress.  GOOD LORD.  I don't know if she was having a bad day or if every day was a bad day for her, but she was so negative.   Brittney told us that because of the cold, we probably didn't want to order any of the crawfish dishes because they were much smaller than normal.  That piece of advice was appreciated. Also, I wouldn't care so much if she was negative and had the biggest frown on her face, but she didn't even give us what we had ordered, which was the fried green tomatoes with shrimp remoulade and the shrimp etouffe (we had no idea what this dish was, but it sounded good, so we ordered it).   Brittney was kind enough to bring out the Fried Green Tomatoes (still as good as the first time I tasted it), but not the etouffe. Instead she bought out the shrimp platter with french fries.  We were so hungry that we didn't even realize we were eating the wrong thing until 2 bites in. At that point, we realized that the shrimp etouffe said nothing about fried shrimp and definitely nothing about french fries.  At that point, we decided to just suck it up and finish our meal.  At least the shrimp were good.  But we were disappointed because it was NOT what we ordered.    Between the ambiance and poor service, MB is not what I remember.

"Worst. Underwhelmed. Do NOT Go  Alright, where do I start? We had reservations at 7:30 however, we still had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. It was Valentine's Day so we were patient. We were seated upstairs which was nice since it was away from the bar. Our server (never told us his name) was rude. He made jokes when my boyfriend and I ordered champagne and asked why we didn't take it ""as a shot""? Like what?   Now onto the food. We were looking to do either the barrel cut or center cut, which ranged between $35-45. The server said they were out of that and read the specials. We chose the bone-in filet (since it was the closest thing to the other steaks we wanted) and I ordered it med. rare. We got the food, he did not wait for me to cut into it, and the steak was horrible. It was completely rare 3/4 of it (i.e. blood oozing out, chewy, horrible). Not the mention the amount of fat on the steak. A FILET WITH THAT MUCH FAT?! Lord.....Also, the server would take forever to check on our table and never watered the table.   Onto the bill. When we got the check it was over $200! For what?! Oh, the ""special"" he failed to mention was $70!!!! WTF? Don't you think you'd mention that to a table if there was such a price jump or give us a paper handout with the prices? The reason this is even more shocking was because at the beginning of our meal he had offered wine by bottle or glass and was being very price savvy with us. He said, ""don't get this vs. that because it's not worth the money"". Interesting how he leaves the $70 shitty steak out of the picture.

"I don't usually write bad reviews for restaurants, especially in this economic climate, but I feel I must warn people not to spend their money at this establishment.

The soup tasted like it was out of a can, the salmon was so dry and bland I could only finish half of it, and I had to request salt from the waiter to rescue the french fries and mashed potatoes. Then the tres leches cake had the texture of cornbread, I kid you not. Restaurant Week is an opportunity to get creative, but the dishes we were served were incredibly simple. If the food is simple, it has to be impeccably made and the food here was anything but.  The service was also incredibly slow. We probably waited half an hour between our appetizer and entree.

"I'm not one to write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so based on our experience at Kasumi.  My family of 6 has been a loyal take-out customer of Kasumi since it opened its doors.  Since we enjoy the food so much we decided to take everyone there for Valentine's Day.  We were one of the first groups at the restaurant. We ordered our food with no issues.  Shortly after, the miso soups and salads arrived.  One of my sons received his salad which came with the dinner he ordered.  When it was time for the main course, the entrees came out as they were ready (e.g. Chickie's and Pete's style, which we hate).  My youngest son received his meal 5 minutes before anyone else.  Two of the same entrees came out next, we ordered 3 and were told the next one was coming.  About 5 minutes later my oldest son's entrée came out.  At this point the restaurant was at capacity and also taking take-out orders. After 10 more minutes passed I told my wife to please eat her entrée.  Fortunately, our sushi tray eventually made its way to us; however, 2 of the 6 entrees never did.  Ironically enough, one entrée that did not find our table was the one where my son received his salad, but yet there was no record of him ordering an entrée.  When asked if we needed anything else we mentioned having all of our dinners would be lovely.  At this point we simply asked for the bill so we can leave and go get my son dinner elsewhere.  Prior to the bill coming, but after having the conversation of missing food we were then asked if we wanted dessert.  Why would I want dessert when 2 family member did not even eat at that point?  They were clearly overwhelmed with the Valentine's eat-in and take-out crowd, but the priority clearly seemed to be on the take-out.  We received our bill, which of course was not credited with anything for our inconvenience.  For the sake of arguing on Valentine's Day, we paid the full bill (at least it didn't have the 2 dinners that never arrived) and left.  We will certainly never eat at Kasumi again and that includes take-out.  Service was slow and customer service was horrific. If you're overwhelmed, have a plan for holidays or hire more people.  Perhaps also focus on the customers in the store and have someone else run the take-out portion.  This was truly disappointing for a Valentine's Day dinner with the kids.

The fish came out under cooked and and the drinks tasted like there wasn't alcohol in them.  I got our waiters attention and asked for a shot we put in both glasses so they tasted right.  When we told the waiter that the fish was under cooked he at first said that they were cleaning up in the kitchen ... but I insisted and he took it back to be cooked more.  When he brought it back the Brocolini was cold and hard.  We were not the last people there.  Totally disappointed I am sorry to say.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Dear Sugarfire,  Your food is absolutely AMAZING! Your brisket is some of the best I have ever had ANYWHERE and I've eaten brisket in at least four different cities in America...two of which are known for their barbecue. But I have to address an issue that for years I hadn't said anything...and now I must. Seven years ago, I used to work a mile or two up the road from Sugarfire. I grabbed lunch to go on a number of occasions. Two different times, I found a hair in my food and it completely grossed me out. I didn't report it. Didn't make a fuss. My co-workers also loved Sugarfire. So I just stopped eating there...for years. Just recently, like a year ago, did I eat the food again because the brisket is THAT good...and it was brought for my family and I during a time of bereavement. I was hoping against hope that the hygiene issues with hair in the food had long been solved. Alas, I just read a review posted just YESTERDAY, September 21, 2020...seven years after my two different times on two different occasions of finding hair in my Sugarfire orders...that another customer has also found a hair in their food. Listen, your food is top notch...the brisket in particular is worth five stars all on its own. Could you please, please, please, for the health, safety and enjoyment of all your customers...some of whom are friends and family of mine...have ALL of your employees who cook/prepare/serve food to wear hats, hair nets, covering, around hair, long beards, etc.??? There is little that will kill your appetite than finding someone else's hair in your food...especially on more than one occasion. Completely and Utterly Unacceptable. Makes me sad to have to let you go forever...",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Wow, just wow...  I went here on 2/4/16 at 12pm with my mom for lunch, I was not very busy which was a plus as I don't like large crowds....she and I were seated immediately and spotted a sign that said all you can eat pancakes (cool, I like pancakes). After being seated we were passed over by 3 waitress that just walked past the table without asking if we've been served. Another 10 minutes goes by and I getting a bit frustrated find a waitress standing by the door. I said excuse me several time (still being ignored/getting ticked off) finally after putting some base in my voice did I get a response (side note I am a former restaurant manager I understand busy employees, but really?)  Finally three waitress respond (that's more like it but your tip is out the window) after they delivered some ""luke warm"" coffee they take our order; by the way we were offered water and never got it,My mom who wanted the all you can eat pancakes, however she was offered three or five..  Not sure if there's a time limit but she took the three and a side of bacon, I ordered the stuffed French toast. Less than ten minutes later here comes our food (alright so it's looking up...not)   My moms pancakes were dry, very salty and cold and so was her bacon, my French toast was so hard you could here the crunch as you cut into it, the waitress also only brought me one when I ordered two, but she brang the other out by this point I've cut into my French toast took a couple of bites and pushed it away, I certainly was not about to touch the second.  We were never checked on as they were busy helping everyone in the main dining room, finally unhappy with this whole deal I had to flag down another waitress to get a bill ( this time I only starred at her I was not about to waste my time and get up and get her)   We informed her of the problem and she took off my moms food but some how didn't notice I barely touched mine.  So after leaving I called the store in o talk to the manager, somehow the same waitress answered the phone I asked to speak to a manager and she informed me she was the only one I can talk to (how convenient)  Told her what I thought about this whole ordeal and she designed to get loud with me...Really? Having not gotten threw to her, and getting pretty angry myself I hang up and called guest relations.  They were attentive and understanding not like the staff at this place and I got the problem solved.  I used to go here all the time and never have I had such horrible service and I will never go back again, I will hop on down to bob evens if I get hungry.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"My first review of Parc was removed so let me try to be more specific.   After having dinner at Barklay Prime we walked up the street to have drinks at Parc. The place was not crowded, and as I stood at the bar waiting to be acknowledged for several minutes I noticed the bar tender counting her tips for the night. Fortunately the bar back got her attention, after realizing I was upset she was unable to muster the the two little words ""I'm Sorry"".   We ordered drinks and instead of vodka tonic, she brought gin and tonic- two very similar clear drinks with two very different taste.  When I pointed out the issue again she was unable to say ""I'm Sorry"".  As far as the atmosphere I found the crowd to be extremely uptight, stuffy and rude.   The food might be good, but based on the customer service I received from the bar and the stuffy environment, I doubt I will be back..",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Awful place.  Yes they sell Silvergreens sandwiches and salads. That's nice.  They probably make great fancy coffee drinks for which you pay too much.  But 5 months a year in SB, this place is an oven.  I parked in the lot before my cheap massage at Little Rainbow Spa and got a glass of ice water and a SB power bar. It was 70 and breezy outside. Inside, over 80 with a bunch of comatose individuals on laptops or reading.  One of the many annoyances of SB is the citywide aversion to a/c. Do SB people think it's a plot of Satan that gives you cancer? 2 million dollar houses have no a/c. Some new fancy houses are plumbed for it, but the owners don't even install central air.  It's a pretty place which is however uninhabitable for anyone who doesn't like living by the equator (or Phoenix).  I would never spend more than 2 minutes in this place except during the winter, and even then the whole no a/c thing offends me so much I would boycott and avoid in protest. I hate cheapness and the failure to install a/c is simply obnoxious.   NO WAY.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Was a loyal customer with New York Richie's until tonight. Never really had a problem before and normally I wouldn't drop a pizza place like this but I'll never order from here again.  I usually Order through Postmates because pizza places can't be bothered to carry insurance and have responsibility of their own drivers anymore.  There was a storm here but yet the roads have been crystal clear for hours. I ordered $40 worth of pizza and it never got picked up. I finally called them and they said ""yeah it's been sitting here for 30 minutes, you'll have to call postmates and figure it out."" Funny thing is, you can't call postmates, so I cancelled my order and although I'll get my money back next week.  The guy was unapologetic and was willing to charge me another $40 for me to go pick up new pizzas.

"Be aware to CHECK YOUR BILL before you pay.  When making reservation for 8 people or more, you are required to pay $10 per guest and this amount is immediately charged to your credit card. The restaurant is SUPPOSED to credit it back when you dine.  I was charged $80 immediately when I made the reservation for 8 people. When I was paying the bill while dining at the restaurant, I didn't check the bill for the credit of $80 reservation charge. The restaurant was supposed to credit it back on the bill. My bill was not credited and I didn't find that out until a couple days later. I had to call back the restaurant for my credit. The manager apologized and said ""someone"" should have asked me how I want this reservation charge credited back.  If I haven't checked my bill and phoned the restaurant back, I would have paid extra $80 and the restaurant would have made a profit of $80 from me!  Also, the restaurant automatically charges 18% tips for a large group and this is added to the total of your bill. When you pay via the machine, it still asks for another tip. The restaurant was packed and hence the services that day weren't great and our server wasn't attentive at our table.

Disappointing experience.  Server forgot appetizer after having a conversation about it then forgot second beer.  When asked about The appetizer her response was did you order an appetizer? When we reminded her of the conversation she took responsibility (which I appreciated her not blaming the kitchen) and she said the manager would come by.  The manager however came to our table hunched over and with a raspy whisper said to keep in mind that dessert was on her...we didn't want desert.  Since we didn't have an appetizer the only way to judge the meal was on the main course.

"I will say that the pizza is good for Florida but, the help...  I have been there several times and found the blonde waitress is challenging at best.  She isn't about service or friendliness, just obtuse. They brag aboutbeing from New York and they have the attitude to prove it. If you like New York attitude it will be a good fit, I don't!  Recently I stopped in and ordered a slice of pizza and an Italian sub.  I watched in awe as this blonde waitress put on rubber disposable gloves that had obviously been used. She then wandered around the area, opening refrigerator doors, taking things out, unwrapping meats and containers, back to the kitchen to a slicer and into the walk in and back to grab a roll to make my sub.  In the interim I had finished my pizza slice and was still waiting for my drink. I was choking for the lack of a drink so, I got up walked over and interrupted two other employees who were talking to each other and asked for my drink to as I was choking. The waitress yelled she's got it and to sit down. I said no, I need it now.  After watching her all over the place I got disgusted at the idea that my food was being prepared by a less than sanitary enviroment and it seemed that the waitresst wore gloves to protect her hands and not for the ability to keep a clean work enviroment while preparing food.   I cancelled my sandwich. She was upset.  As I paid I asked another wait person if everything was ok as this waitress always seemed angry with an obvious attitude, he said yes. I then asked the kitchen manager if everything was ok as the service was worse than usual and the waitress doesn't understand the reason for gloves. He said she had to get things to make the sandwich, I suggested she get them before putting on the gloves or to change the gloves.   This was to no avail.  It seemed everyone was angry in this pizzeria today, thats not a customers problem.  I called the other location hoping to get an owner or manager, again to my dismay none were working. They asked if they could help and I shared my interaction with the ""blonde"" waitress and that this wasn't the first time, she was dirty, rude, gave poor service and had a bad attitude.   The response knocked me over, this 30-40 something woman is the daughter of the owner. T  That explains why she is working there!  The pizza is good but, the food is not prepared in a clean environment and this waitress is from hell with a bad attitude. The rest of the staff emulates her.

As for tonight, I took my girlfriend and her sister who is in from Colorado to Joe's because we were raving about how great it was, and I am so incredibly disappointed with everything from start to finish. Having worked in the restaurant industry as a server for 6 years now, I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt. The hostesses were nice, not overly friendly but good enough. Our waitress started out nice, pretty talkative but that's okay. Took her over 5 minutes to greet us. Took 20 minutes to even get our drinks on the table. Our appetizer of fries was delivered before we even had waters or our bar drinks delivered. She explained that they were incredibly busy, but things kept getting worse. I ordered a side salad which I did not get until an hour and a half after we sat down!! For a salad, for lettuce and tomatoes on a plate, it took that long. I approached one manager to tell him it had been 20 minutes since we had drinks and he was nice about that. I had to go to the bar to order myself another drink because our waitress disappeared. She kept checking back with us asking about what we ordered because I guess she lost our order. Our food finally got delivered at 8:15 when we were seated at 6:30! Everything was wrong. Burger was burnt. Chicken came without fries and was extremely salty. One member of my group couldn't even eat it. Steak on the salad was disgusting. The manager made things better by giving us gift cards to use next time, but honestly I do not think we will be back. It was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant in a very long time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"My husband and I decided to try this place because it was close to our home. We'll never do that again! He ordered fajitas with chicken, steak, and shrimp while I had fajita nachos with chicken. The shrimp in his fajitas were not shelled and still had the legs on them. He said his food was very salty and he actually didn't want to even finish it. My chicken was tough and some of my nachos were burned. I wasn't able to stomach much of it and ended up bringing some home. Maybe the kids will eat it. Our service was not good. We saw our server only a few times. When we were seated, when we ordered, when food was delivered, and when she brought a box. We were never offered refills in our empty drinks that were sitting at the end of the table for 5+ minutes. When it came time to pay, I got two different totals and ended up paying something different than both (how that happened, I don't know...). We got outta there as fast as we could. We should've turned around when the sign misspelled guacamole and the menu said that the chicken may contain bones (what???!!!!???). One thing is for sure, we'll definitely not be eating here ever again.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"The food was great, but the service was terrible. If you come and eat here I recommend that you memorize everything you ordered because upon paying the cashier won't know because they screen doesn't tell them. We came and a cashier ""Connie"" was just staring at us waiting to tell her everything we ordered. After we waited for her to repeat our order she opened her eyes wide open with and gave us a sassy look as if she were waiting for something. She asked us what we had ordered and we had to tell her everything. As a restaurant they should have a system that indicates which over goes with which customer. For the customer to have to repeat their own order is just lazy on part of the restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I've been to Burger Republic a few times, and for the most part it has been a decent visit with acceptable foods. This latest visit however, was terrible.  To start with, the temperature in the area had been warmer than usual. The restaurant had no AC, no fans, and was open to the outside. The interior of the building was very, very warm. Warm enough, in fact, that most servers had glistening forehead and arms/legs from sweat! That's what I want...my server all sweaty while handing me my food...  The server we had that day was atrocious. She was as flaky as they come, never bringing us what we requested (extra straw, to-go box, etc) until we reminded her 2-3 times. She took forever to take our order after getting drinks, and by the time she checked on us after we (finally) got our food - we were mostly done eating!  The wait for the food dragged on for an eternity. They were very busy, but that was not the main problem. There were 9 people, over 2 groups who were seated after us and got their food before us. One of the tables was just about finished by the time we even got our food handed to us - and they arrived later than we did! All in all it was a 1:15 minute visit with very little of that time taken up eating.  The food tasted fairly good, but some orders had serious problems. The ""Four Cheese (something something) Burger"" had a single dollop of cheese about the size of a quarter on it. I was searching through the burger looking for cheese and finally found it - first mistaking it for a small circle of mayo or something.  The 2 other burgers had no structural integrity by the time we got them. One just kept falling apart while it was eaten. The other, even worse, was so soggy by the time we got it that the bottom bun was just mush. That burger was only able to be eaten with a fork.   All in all this was a devastating visit. I would not go back there until I see some changes made - and this was not my first visit.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"With all the other great restaurants downtown, I'm unlikely to return given their poor staff performance. I love Taxman beer and the Bargersville location, but this visit to City was a huge disappointment. Unfriendly hostess, cramped entry into the dining area with servers who won't move for guests while loitering in the walkway, and a waitress who didn't know what was on the feature burger of the day and couldn't answer questions about the menu. Our burgers were overcharred with dry, chewy edges even though we asked for medium. To top it off, the waitress charged me for a different table that had a MUCH larger bill than ours and said she couldn't provide a receipt showing the refund back to my card.

Not big a price difference if you're not poor like me. She gave such attitude. They barely ever actually stir the coffees. The wraps completely fall apart. It's like they don't try at all when it comes to putting the food together. Also terrible service at the counter. There will be either 1 or nobody at the till and there's a line up out the door. I don't work there, nor have I ever worked in food, but I could do their jobs better than a lot of the workers do them. If it wasn't too far I would go to the next nearest McDonald's (which is way better by the way).  Not saying that all the employees aren't good at their job, because there are a few that are great at what they do.

"We arrived with a party of 12 and the waitress/hostess immediately began to give us a hard time about not having a reservation. It was a last minute decision by us and I had called shortly beforehand to see if they were on a wait. There were only 3 other tables in the entire restaurant that had guests and they all appeared to have already been served. Nevertheless, against my better judgement, we went ahead and were seated. The waitress was very rude and acted as if we were inconveniencing her. It took us a long time to receive a round of waters, two beers, and a sprite. After, not being offered an opportunity to place our orders within an acceptable time period, I asked for the bill. We paid for our 2 beers and a sprite and left. The waitress nor the manager had the decency to ask why we were paying the bill and leaving. This was the most disappointing experience that I have ever had. We left and went to Sushi Maru and had an amazing time where we left almost a $200 tip for the waitress.   :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

I don't understand how people give this place good reviews.  Don't order anything with chicken in it because it's likely to be so old tasting that it probably isn't even fit to eat.

"I was pretty excited to finally get a Pizza Hut in the Santa Barbara area, but upon my first visit, I was sadly disappointed. I placed an online order, which is pretty difficult to mess up, but they managed to. I didn't go for any of their fancy new additions like the new crusts, sauces, drizzles, etc. but given this experience, I'm not confident they could even handle any of those. I simply ordered a meat lovers pizza with extra sauce, and the amount of sauce on my pizza was pathetic. It seemed like even less sauce than normal. Not only that, but the pizza just wasn't good. After a couple bites, I decided to forego eating the pizza altogether, and found a homeless man to give it to. Meanwhile, I was starving but went to Woodstocks and waited for a pizza actually worthwhile.   In addition to the poor quality, the service also wasn't great. The pizza was nearly cold and the girl working there was kind of rude and basically suggested leaving a tip...for a take out order. When I got back into my car, I saw her ranting to her co-workers about something in rather animated fashion. I'm not conceited enough to think it had anything to do with me, especially since I was friendly and raised no issues, despite lacking customer service. However, it just didn't seem professional to me. Granted, how professional could one expect someone who works at Pizza Hut to be, but still.   If this is how this location operates when it just opened, I can just imagine how the quality and service will decline over time. Hopefully, for their sake, it improves, but I'm not sure if I'll be going back there.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I've been going here for 20+ years. My family has been coming here for 38+ years - literally back when they had live music. This place used to have amazing Mexican food! They have since changed a number of the recipes recently and even the salsa is absolutely awful. I loved coming here to see Maria over the last 17 years and I would eat endless bowls of chips and salsa while I waited for my burrito Gonzales to come out piping hot from the kitchen. I just stopped in today and was waited on by her daughter and the food was a joke. I didn't even eat half of it. I don't know if they sold the restaurant to someone that doesn't know wtf they're doing or if they've just tried to experiment with things, but here is my message to the owners: There is an old sang.. if it ain't broke don't fix it!!! I've been back here 4 times now hoping this was some kind of a one off fluke in the kitchen and it's not. You guys have clearly changed things for the worse and have single handedly ruined the food here, congrats. Today was my last visit.   FYI for those of you who agree with me you can go to Delgado's in Carpinteria.

"EPIC fail!  Met good friends here towards the end of their meal . . . didn't want to make them sit there while I ate, so I just had a Carpaccio appetizer, which was good, albeit small if this were to be shared.  After spending some nice time with them up in the JW Lounge, which, btw, is very nice, I decided to sit down at the bar and grab dinner, as I did not want to go drinking on a relatively empty stomach.  Now, it was 9:30, the restaurant was slow, and the bartender was very nice . . . ordered Calamari & Cioppino.  The Calamari came out, and it looked like a giant mish mosh of everything that was left in the fryer . . . carrots, some other vegetables, and Calamari, and it was covered in a nondescript sauce.  Let me tell you, there was less Calamari on the plate than anything else . . . I found myself digging through the mess, trying to actually find edible morsels . . . this was not a good start, but my friend had eaten the Cioppino, and it looked good, so I figured it would make up for the app . . . boy was I wrong!  So when you travel, you spend a lot of time by yourself . . . so here I am, sitting at the bar alone, with conversations going on around me waiting on the main course . . . 5 minutes, to minutes, 15 minutes . . . 20 minutes later my Cioppino shows up . . . the bartender actually had to send somebody back to find out what happened . . . Now don't get me wrong, the dish LOOKED great . . . took my first spoonful . . . YIKES!  Salty and TART . . . not the two words I think of when think Cioppino.  Had to try another spoonful to make sure I was not crazy, as I've eaten this dish dozens of times . . . but nope, it tasted like the chef had dumped slat and lemon into a bowl of fish.  Pushed the bowl away.  Bartender comes over and I explain that not only had I waited 20 minutes for a simple dish in a fairly empty restaurant, but the dish was horrible.  He apologizes, removes the dish, and makes the obligatory beeline for the manager.  I see them speak, and thinking she would head directly over, am surprised that she goes and chats with another couple of people before finally coming over to ask what was wrong.  I explain, to which she says, ""We can make you another, but it will take a bit.""  I chirp back, ""Do you think I want to sit for another 20 minutes by myself?""

"Ok... So I'll start by saying that I LOVE good fried chicken. Love it! Every once in a while, I crave it and have to have it. I had one such day this week. I went out to lunch (which I rarely do) and really wanted to bite into a crispy-juicy-flavorful chicken leg. Alas, it was not to be.   I ended up driving all the way here from Macdill AFB on lunch break (that should tell you how much of a craving I had) after my other preferred restaurants failed to provide the Southern Cuisine delicacy I was craving.  I get there and 2 other gentlemen hold the door open for me. I get seated and patiently wait for my server. She appears. Their menu is simple and full of Southern Cuisine staples so I already know what I want when she shows up: Kettle Fried Chicken Platter (dark meat) with black eye peas and mac & cheese and an Arnold Palmer to wash it down. Then I wait.  And I wait.  And I wait.  Another server brings me a plate with a pork chop on it. I politely let her know that is someone else's order and she walks away. And I wait.  And I wait. I'm going to be late going back to work.   The same server who brought me the pork chop brings me another plate with the wrong order on it. And I still do not have my Arnold Palmer.  And I wait.   I should be sitting back at my desk by now. Instead I am sitting 14 miles and about 30 minutes away.... not eating chicken. Not sipping on my Arnold Palmer. Just waiting.  I finally give up and get up, found my server, who by the way has not checked on me the entire time, and ask her to cancel my order. She barely nods and I walk away.   As I'm walking out I get right behind the same 2 gentlemen who held the door open for me when I came in. They are leaving too, except they had their food served to them. I did not.

"I haven't been to Quiznos in years. I was in the area and I was really hankering for a French dip. The lady in the restaurant greeted me at the door which was nice. She was pleasant. I got my sandwich to go and off I went.   When I opened the sandwich, the ""sautéed"" onions looked mildly blanched, but I wasn't going to judge that on looks. They did smell pretty raw still, but only taste will be the judge.  The au jus, however, did give itself away on sight. It looked like diluted chicken broth. It smelled of nothing. This wasn't starting off well, but again - taste be thy determiner.   Hoo boy. I'm starting to think looks don't deceive. The onions were crunchy and tasted raw. I had to take them off of my sandwich because they were way too overpowering. It tasted like they were put into boiling liquid for 2 minutes max.   The true crime, however, was the ""au jus"". Imagine for a moment, dear reader, that you took beef broth and watered it down. Then you watered that down. Then you dumped that into a lake, and took a ladle and scooped up the lake water au jus. That was what it tasted like - nothing, with a sprinkling of something unpleasant. It had no salt, no spice - it tasted like if you took the idea of beef, wrapped that on a carrot, dipped it into celery water, and then hated it.   I'm sad, because I used to love Quiznos.

"Wow, where do I start?  Had the worst restaurant experience of my life last night at Pepperoncini.  I've never experienced anything like this at any kind of a restaurant, no matter the dining level.  I should say that I've been here before and had a very nice meal so I can't explain the complete collapse of this place.  First, we waited almost 15 minutes for our server to appear.  Then, it was nearly another 40 mins for drinks to arrive.  Almost 1hr after we sat down and just getting drinks.

Waiting to order more drinks was an eternity, so much so we were about to walk to the bar ourselves to order but our server finally re-appeared.  Then the topper, the entrees arrive but one is completely wrong so that is sent back.  2 of the 3 that were correct turned out to be terrible.  One is not hot and was supposed to include lump crab meat - not a trace!  The other was a mess thrown on a plate .  10 minutes later our server re-appears to inform us that the wrong entrée would take 20 minutes to correct.  Faced with no meal, we opt for the Lobster Ravioli (this was the first incorrect entrée that was brought to the table).  It's arrives not 2 minutes later, steaming hot.  Can you say ""Microwave""?  and you guessed it....not a trace of Lobster anywhere.  We were so disgusted we asked for a manager. We were told the manager walked out (as some other diners did at the table next to us).  None of us even finished half our meal and requested something be done.  The staff was kind enough to only hold us to the bar bill, which we happily paid.   Have never, ever seen a place so terribly run.  The owner should be ashamed and owes an apology to everyone in the restaurant that evening, including the staff.  Won't ever return.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

My boyfriend told me negative things about this place but we were hungry and really wanted to watch the fight.

When we get in we are given a PAGE of food items that were basically just nachos (and extremely overpriced...13.99 for steak nachos) but again we were hungry so we ordered it. They gave us the plates with NO utensils or napkins and left. The TV was later than the speakers so we heard everything before seeing it.

"So after eating here two times, and compared to the Library in Williamstown, I would not return.  Let me tell you why.  First, the bartenders were not very attentive.  They were more interested in their cell phones.  Next, we ordered one prime rib to share, and we eat decided to get the salad bar.  The salad bar looked as if it was hit by a tornado.  Everything was everywhere and it hadn't been attended to in quite some time.  Now, for the prime rib.  It was extremely fatty and well over cooked when it was supposed to be medium rare.  I do believe the quality has changed  here since the price of beef went up.  We sent that back and they were not happy, but when you asked for MR and it comes out almost well, that's a problem.  All their meals are ridiculously priced especially for the quality.  Lastly, their cocktails are very under poured for the price.  Over all, I would not return based on the quality of the food and how over priced it is.  Cocktails are outrageous for what you receive.  Lastly, think we both got sick from the salad bar, maybe too many people with dirty hands and it was not kept very well.  Maybe Im spoiled, but the Library in Williamstown is much much better and not as expensive.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

I used the restroom which also needs a good wash down. The wooden tables holding cleaning fluids was dirty and the overall cleanliness is poor. I could see the drainage outlet that was greasy. The door had graffiti from the inside that looks like a dirty truck stops.  Sorry guys. The food was not to rave about.

The waitress was extremely nice and took his plate to the cook to let him know so that he could fix the order. The cook started screaming and complaining giving attitude that , that was how the customer asked for it . Really? Very unprofessional. We began to order and we could hear the cook still complaining.

The cook then began to scream and complain ""well that's how over easy eggs are and that's what she asked for"" He had a really bad attitude and just threw the plate on the counter.

New location for the Chill. Wow what a difference from the old place.   The atmosphere is extremely loud. Conversations from around the misplaced bar can be plainly and painfully heard above your own. The bar noise was incredible. Every shaken and frozen drink resounded even above the din of patrons shouting to be heard.  It's a huge echo chamber.  Dinner started well with some very hot chicken wings and edamame hummus. I had the Alaskan salmon ordered medium. It was served with our salad? And was obviously beyond well done. Given the amount of time it spent on the grill it was surprising that it was also served up cold on top of over done asparagus and swimming in a cold sauce that overpowered the fish.   I asked to speak to the manager and was told the owner wasn't there. Our server came left than came back to see if I wanted to talk to someone. At that point I said no just bring the check. I told him they had a lot of work yet to do. He rolled his eyes at me and walked off. The service along with the noise and bad food really shows what happens when a good restaurant ties to get bigger without proper planning and training  I won't be back. Is it possible to give negative stars?,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I don't normally do reviews, but this was so bad, horrible even, that I couldn't NOT give a review. I order from my local Chinese restaurant and bring it to work. However, today I forgot to order, so I ordered from China Pearl near where I work. It is 7 mins from where I work and it still took almost an hour to get the delivery. I ordered large BBQ Ribs and 6 chicken wings, which is what I normally order. When I opened the bad, the ""wings"" were in another bag, not a typical container. I opened the ribs and was surprised by the size of the ribs and the quantity. Normally the ribs are packed into the container and the container needs to be stapled closed. Not this order. Of the 6 ""wings"" that I ordered,  1 was a wing and the other 5 were balls and pretty much nothing but bones.  I don't even know what part of the chicken they came from. The wings weren't breaded, but they were so crunchy and brittle, and tasted like egg rolls. Guess they only have 1 fryer. The ribs tasted like pineapple, not the normal flavoring on Chinese ribs. The ribs were so tough, I almost needed a chisel to get the meat off the bone. I ate 2 of the 8 ribs and the 1 wing and 1 ball and threw the rest out. I don't' enjoy fighting with my food.

"We had no idea this was a Starr restaurant until we saw ""STARR"" postcards by the door as we left. Stella had no ""Starr"" quality. We thought it was a slightly better looking than average, decent quality, grossly overpriced ""New York Style (wink wink)"" pizza place that would thrive in it's location due to outdoor seating.  First there is nothing on the menu about the size of the pizza. This is important. The extremely thin crust, sparsely topped, brittle pies came in one size, one usually considered  ""small.""  Neither the menu nor our server mentioned this.  Our server came over 3 times to take our order and never offered any info or assistance as we wrangled with the menu. Prices ranged from $10 to $17 per pizza. We assumed splitting one would be a meal.  Many of the pizza combinations seemed more creative than complementary. The ""special pizza"" with ramps sounded delicious but tender, delicate, seasonal ramps were paired with asparagus which upon roasting would overwhelm the ramps. We ordered thru a similar process of elimination. We have adventurous palettes but respect ingredients and don't eat as a ""dare"" preferring harmony. We got a meatball pie with ricotta, mozzarella and fresh basil and a romaine salad to split.   The service was ""hovery"" but not good. A server should stand still when they ask ""is everything ok."" When we did have a question -if goat cheese was in the ""Romaine salad"" we were served, our server said  ""No, it's Ricotta (garbled)"" haughtily turned on her heel and left. We both loathe goat cheese but picked around whatever the hell it was and enjoyed the salad. The red onions and hints of mint worked well together. The romaine and tomatoes were fresh.  The casual food and decor clashes with the constant clearing, of dishes, especially those still in use. Philadelphia kitchens have come to rely more and more on fewer and fewer Philadelphians and Stella is no exception. Sad to see a South Street ""open kitchen"" wood fired, brick oven pizza being completely staffed by people who chattered loudly in Spanish. That brought the ""authentic wood fired pizza experience"" down several notches.  The interior was stylish but not outstanding. The personalized wood burning oven screamed look at me. The bathrooms were clean but rather pedestrian. The newly renovated Melrose Diner's ladies room with glass tile is more stylishly appointed. The muzak was ironic, mixing the Jam with Fleetwood Mac.  We had just finished our salad when the pizza came. We both laughed. It was tiny. The crust was highly visible. At the first bite we could tell this pizza was a New York joke on South Street patrons. It was literally a ""meatball pizza"" it perhaps had ONE thinly shaved meatball on the whole thing. The crust was floury, tortilla thin, crackly and artfully appointed with toppings. It was tasty, tiny, extremely expensive and unsatisfying.  While swatting away staff who kept trying to take our plates while we swiftly ate the pizza we announced our verdict on Stella, SUCKS and is for SUCKERS.  There was mounting tension and disappointment as we realized we both were still hungry, but didn't want to order another precious pizza. We considered our portions equivalent to a ""light lunch.""  Our server, or a size on the menu could have guided us better. Really easy fixes.  We were STUNNED to find out it was a Starr place as we left. Only 2 clues it was a Starr place, the choice of bottled or ice water and ramps as a feature ingredient. The cost per portion should have been a clue.  After we settled up, we took our starving selves to Phileo.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Had a recent visit to the new place by my work for lunch with my wife.  Got there and paid and got a receipt showing 15.20 which was correct.  Food was decent.  Got home that night and ran to the ATM to get some money and did not have enough in my account to withdrawl.  Went home and checked my online banking and found a 75.20 charge in addition to the 15.20 as pending.   I went back the next day(Thursday) as they both showed pending still and the manager was nowhere to be found.  The lady up front at the register laughed when I told her and started trying to chat me up about what I did for a living.  She finally told me to come back on Saturday if there was still a problem.  On Saturday, they were still both showing as pending for some reason and I went back in and the manager told me the bank made a mistake.  I disagreed stating the bank would not randomly charge 75.20 to their restaurant and was more likely a mistake on their part of mis-entering the total.  I told him if it was a mistake and my card was credited back then I should have been informed and shown that my card was credited back so I would know there was a hold on it for that amount and it was a significant amount.  He said it could be possible that they pushed the wrong amount but unlikely and that he had to make a call.  He called someone and was on the phone for over 40 minutes before telling me that my account really wasn't missing the 75.20.  I told him that it definately was and possibly was just a hold that would be back in my account after a few days since a mistake was made but still was a huge inconvenience that I should have been made aware of.  He agreed that it was a possible hold and I could call to have it immediately removed.  I asked him to do it since it was his store's error and I had already spent an hour there waiting on him to figure it out.  He said he needed to make another phone call to try to get the hold taken off  and after 20 minutes I finally took my account statement and receipt and told him I would be back if the charges did go through.  No apology for what happened and did not care at all that the mistake had wiped out the money in my checking account until I got paid 2 days later.  Nor for the hour+ of my life that was wasted for him scrambling to find and excuse for what happened.  Just recommend if you pay with a debit/credit card you check and make sure something similar does not happen to you.

Both have been nurses (bachelor and master degreed) for decades; my wife finally retired after 45+ years.

She has spent years in health care and recognized the symptoms of food poisoning.  When she called the manager of Piccadilly Cafeteria this morning, the manager was dismissive and told her to get a physician's opinion, which she will in a few hours.  The manager claimed that no one had ever become sick at that site.  While that is highly unlikely since the outlet has been there for years, my wife chose not to argue with her that it (a) probably not true and she was lying, (b) might not reflect people who did not know what food poisoning is, and/or (c) might not capture those who did not know how to file a complaint.

"This seemed like a great idea at the start, but it fails at the very core level of restaurantship. The food was mediocre at best. First and foremost the iPads at every seat and high chair plus new aged decor lured me in, but left me high and dry without the courtesy of a happy ending in the end. I ordered using their snazzy iPads, but when I got my beer it had some kind of little object in it. Let's call it mystery twig. I promptly asked for a replacement and they obliged.   Next thing were the size of the appetizers. They were huge. I did not expect them to be so big, and normally i would entertain the notion of welcoming large plates of food, however in this case I was sadly disappointed. I decided to order the orange chipotle wings. When they came I didn't detect either orange nor chipotle. The meat seemed a tad under completely cooked and had no flavor what so ever. The glaze which they seemingly added after cooking the wings had a separated taste. You taste the glaze then as you bite in deepest you are lost in a sea of blandness. The only thing that saved the dish was the blue cheese dressing. Normally I finish every plate of wings I ever order even if it's mediocre. Sadly not In this case. Come on guys... You can do better.  I also ordered a burger that I custom made myself. I have yet to eat it because I was so full after eating the wings, yet so unsatisfied that I decided to head to my connecting flight instead and eat the burger later at my final destination.

Website says they are open until 2:00am. We pulled into the drive through at midnight and were told they only served nuggets and fries during those hours. When we heard that we cracked a joke about wanting a spicy chicken sandwich and she told us to leave. This is the first I've heard of Wendy's only serving nuggets after a certain hour and then being told to leave by an employee is wrong.

"I was really looking forward to experiencing this burger since I am a burger fanatic and had never tried Culvers.  Incredible disappointment!!   The skinny greasy patties were so tasteless it was like chewing on a stale sponge!!   Yes , I ate it as it was almost 9 bucks for rhe double burger basket aka combo.  Never again!!!

"We heard great reviews about The Palms so we had high expectations when coming here. When we walked in, our first impression was that it seemed old, dirty, and in major need of the show ""Bar Rescue"". We sat at the bar where the chairs were cracked and old. I had to switch them around because they were pinching the backs of my legs. The glass of wine I ordered tasted like the bottle had been open for several days before I was poured the last of it.   Yes you have to cook your own food here, or endure the salad bar. Even my husband who will eat anything was displeased. Anything ""served"" is deep fried or you have to go stand over the grill for however long to cook your own steaks. We wanted to sit down, relax, and have some good food served to us. We cook at home a lot, and wanted to take a break!  It all was very disappointing, and I began to wonder if we were at the same place people were talking about (we were).   The [male] bartenders were curt and came off unfriendly, smiling very little, and seemed generally uninterested in us. We asked for menus and were forgotten about for over 10 minutes until he recognized our 'social cues' that we were still waiting... Our glasses stayed empty, we were never offered ""another one"" (simple sales tactic, right?), we had to flag him down every time. And no it wasn't busy.   Anyway, we tried it out a few times. We won't ever eat here again, and aren't really interested in having just a beer either. There are lots of other bars to sit at in town that don't make you feel greasy when you leave.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Terrible experience here tonight. I would have given them a break because it was right after Hurricane Irma but they appeared fully staffed, had no power problems, and weren't very busy. There were several empty tables and by the time we finally got our food, the place was more than half empty. There was no good reason for the slow bad service and average food. There were 3 of us and we ordered 2 quesadillas and a 2 taco plate. Nothing too difficult. The food wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. Nothing to write home about. Very average Mexican food. It took more than 45 minutes to get our food and once it came, we didn't see our waitress again. She never checked on us and never brought us the check.

Once seated, our orders were taken, drinks and bread arrived at the table with salads following shortly thereafter.  Then after a fifty-five, yes a 55 minute wait, our entrees arrived.  When the manager came around to check on us, I told him about the L-O-N-G wait.  He went to check, came back and informed us that since I had ordered prime rib it caused the delay.  Apparently the prime rib wasn't ready at 1:00p in the afternoon.  Hmmmm, maybe that should've been mentioned upon ordering?

"I almost never visit this particular Cora if I can help it. It's not the food, it's the service. There is one waitress who works here who never ceases to frustrate me. Even as she's taking your order, she begins walking off nodding as you get to the end, so doesn't hear all the extras.   The first time we visited this location, I asked for a side of Swiss cheese with my Peggy's Poached. She thought I said ""cream cheese"" (becuse she was walking away at the time) and brought me this hunk of white stuff, so I had to correct her and make her bring the correct type.   She aso brought the wrong kind of toast. I asked for multigrain, and she brought white.    The last time, she just started filling my coffee cup before asking if I would like a refill. To other people, this may not seem like a big deal. But for me, it's huge. I'm on Weight Watchers, and unfortunately, I can't drink black coffee (which has no points). I hadn't yet finished the one cup I'd allotted for myself, and the points for the milk and sugar additions I had to add.   I explained WHY she should always ASK before filling someone's cup, because it's not always a good thing. Also, lady, take the time to LISTEN to your customers' orders, and write everything DOWN so you get it right!

I was holding my dog at the door as I could not leave him unattended - and 2 people said NO - you can't bring that dog in here.

I wanted to ask her if she was having a bad day but I opted out because I didn't have the energy. I got my food and left. The second time I went She was there again.

"I used to like this place. But my last two online orders have been a mess. 1st time I didn't get my food after an hour and when I called they said they didn't receive the online order. They made no offer to get it right. Not even a $1 off my meal.  2nd time on 2/14/14 I ordered. After an hour I called and was told it just went out the door. I called 30 minutes later and was told it was on it's way. 30 minutes later I called and was told it was on it's way with another delivery to a place nearby. The last time I called I talked to manager Brian. He was rather rude and didn't seem to care. Only said they were busy. and said he saw no order from me but would look into it and call back. He never called back.  I went out to another place to get food. 5 minutes after I came back the Cecil delivery driver showed up. It was 3 hours and 10 minutes late!  I've emailed from their website's Contact Us 3 times but have received no response. I've emailed the email address of a Cecil Whitakers email I receive often with specials. But I've received no response. I've called the store 3 more times and left a message for Scott to call, but he hasn't called.  They charge $4 or more for delivery!

"I see a few reviews in the past talking about the meat being overcooked... my experience was the opposite.  I ordered 2 donair poutines.  Walking in, there was no greeting, no acknowledgement.  I just stood there awkwardly. until somebody looked at me.  They still barely acknowledged me, he just looked at me and literally said ""what you want?"".  At this point, I just wanted to leave because I felt uncomfortable, but I placed my order.  There was confusion when I ordered and they seemed to think I was picking up a phone order, so they started handing me a bag as soon as I paid... without actually cooking anything.  I clarified that I hadn't placed a phone order... I just wanted to order.   Customers kept coming in to order, they made no attempt to maintain their store capacity, and never asked people to wait outside, even when it was full.  At one point, I noticed that one of the two staff were no longer wearing his mask.  I had already ordered and paid, so I didn't leave, I waited.  Once I got our order home and started eating, I was really disappointed.  I should have left when I didn't feel right.  The food was  honestly disgusting.  The meat was chewy and flavourless and the fries weren't cooked all the way through.  There was barely any sweet sauce on them.

When I asked how long we would have to wait for an actual table, a large table magically opened & we were seated immediately.   Our waiter was constantly rushing, which made it difficult to order drinks and food. When the food came out, the man brought an extra order of tacos that we didn't order. Instead of taking the food back directly, he tried to tell us we made a mistake when ordering.   As for the food, it was nothing exciting.

"Yikes, where do I start.  After reading all the good reviews online about one of the best places for bbq, we ordered and drove to pick it up.  I was the one picking up the order.  Had I seen the place first, we never would have ordered from here.    Walking in the door you come into the smallest, dirtiest waiting area I have ever seen.  Had the feel of a greasy car repair shop, not a food establishment.  There wasn't a clean surface anywhere, the chairs for people to sit on where filthy, literally.  It looked like nothing had been cleaned or disinfected ever....  only enough room for 2-3 people.  Let me just say we will not be ordering from this place again because of the condition of the place, which makes you question the storage of the food and overall food safety.  Doesn't Delco have health inspectors?  This place is way overdue for a visit before someone gets sick.    Those who took the challenge and ate the NC bbq sandwiches and chips said it was tasty but nothing memorable, but they did however spend the night in the ""facilities"" saying it went right through them.  no wonder.  My personal advice would be to find a clean bbq place that serves just bbq, and not a confusing bunch of mexican, too.  Chips were good but bland.  Odd set up and so very dirty.  Beware, see the place before you eat the food.  All I can figure, is whoever on the websites for good regional bbq (other than yelp) did not pick up the orders they ate themselves.

"I made my first visit to Zaxby's tonight.  Coworkers said good things.  The drive thru was ridiculous so I went inside.    After ordering there was a very long wait.  And I must've seen over 10 people working.   Two members of the staff were very attentive and apologetic towards one customer who ordered after I ordered.  They said nothing to me.  After that other customer was taken care of, someone asked about my order, then walked away.  Eventually someone asked if I wanted to change my order, if not I'd have to wait another 5 minutes.   I waited.    I've never seen so many people work with their backs to customers.    After 5 minutes, I tried to get someone's attention.  One staff member was busy talking to his friend across the counter, but I was close enough to hear him talk about his hospital visit, his broken finger and how he was ""so mad.""  Even though I walked to the counter and stood close enough to eavesdrop, he never thought to ask if he could help me with anything.    At that point I asked to cancel my order.  That was also a charade.   I eventually got my refund.  No apology though.  The cold beer had been sitting in my car for approximately half an hour.  And I missed a bit more of the playoff game that was on than I planned.    I'll never be back there again.  Ever.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"After the fourth or fifth time I said 'no, thank you' to a man saying he wanted to buy me a drink, he began aggressively telling me I was being rude and refused to leave me alone while I was waiting for a drink at the bar.   I walked back to my five friends at the other side of the room and we all watched him putting his fingers in a V shape on his chin then waggling his tongue at me, in between giving me the middle finger in front of the entire room.   This was reported to management Saturday night, October 30th and NOTHING was done. No one spoke to him. The man then walked by taking pictures. We had to leave.   I am appalled that management allowed a disgusting, perverted little old man to behave like this. I have come to NOLA for conventions in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 and have never seen anyone tolerate such vile behavior.    Btw, instead of saying 'I have X# of drink orders in front of you, I'll be with you in a moment' the bartenders put their heads down and ignored me.  He loudly demanded their attention and the one cleaning up immediately stopped to serve me, that's when he seemed to feel entitled to speak to me.

Chili's is my FAVORITE chain restaurant ever. I always have a great experience and the food and service are a reason why I am a repeat costumer.  This specific location does not live up to the standards. The bartender was on his phone the whole time and refused to check on his patrons to make sure they were doing good. It was really unprofessional and a really horrible representation of a company that has spent decades to obtain a reputation of being a great establishment. It was mostly awkward because you could tell everyone at the bar was getting really bad service. Very disappointing and will not be back at this location.   I'd like to add that due to Covid only half of the restaurant was full and there is no excuses for the lack of attention.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Sooooo... I end up here periodically because other people in my group feel the food is worth it. I will heartily say no.  I ordered the alla vodka yesterday and it was lacking seasoning. Also it made me sick. Feeling like an old maid we went for a late lunch/early dinner. Being the only meal I consumed yesterday their can be no other culprit. I have spent 90% of the evening yesterday and the morning today being painfully uncomfortable and running to the bathroom. The last few hours have been me chasing pepto-bismol with ginger ale. I know this is way too much TMI. But when you can audibly hear your gut groan and double over I feel others should have a heads up.

"So we've been coming to this restaurant for years when we are in town and we purchased the Living Social deal and it said included certain items like appetizer, 2 entrees, salad and dessert but never specified that it was only from a ""special"" limited menu and that you couldn't choose what you wanted from the regular full menu. I will NEVER purchase another deal for this restaurant. We went in the other day and ordered our meal and then when we went to pay the waitress said that we should have told her up front that we had the voucher and that she couldn't accept it now. We had to go back another time (2 days later) just to use it but will probably not be back again now because this is not the way you run a restaurant or utilize the ""Groupon"" or ""Living Social"" Deals. It is supposed to be that we pay a certain $ amount  and it is good for a higher $ amount to be used on the FULL menu just like EVERY other place we've ever bought one from. I am extremely dissappointed in my experience and would HIGHLY recommend that Living Social read this restaurant's YELP.COM reviews to see that other Living Social customers have had similar experiences and revoke them from selling on this website.

"Was excited to try this restaurant after attempting to come a couple times and having a line out the door. However, was severely disappointed in the amount of time it took to get our main course out to us. I was in a group of 5 adults and 1 child. It WAS a Saturday night but it most definitely was NOT busy. It took almost 45 minutes for our main dishes to come out.   I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad. On the menu it states ""served with buttermilk herb dressing and crumbled blue cheese."" To my surprise my salad came out with mushrooms on it. Not only on top but they appeared to be chopped up in the salad. Now, mushrooms are a pretty common allergy so I thought it very odd the waitress did not mention that when I ordered.   Upon receiving my ""new"" salad I heard the waitress say to someone in the kitchen ""it's not your fault just put the toppings onto a house salad.""  Then, my ""new BBQ chicken salad came out with black olives on it... something that comes only on the house salad.   After picking out the black olives (not a fan of them) I was able to eat my salad and it most certainly was not worth the 45 minute wait.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"To call this place a Japanese restaurant may be one of the bigger insults. I am a fan of Two Ten Jack and was excited about trying Green Pheasant. Boy was I let down. When we walked in the music was positively blaring. When we said something to our server he told us that we were not the first, but the fourth person to complain. When they turned it down, it hardly made any difference. I started with the tuna tartare with crispy rice. We thought they brought out the wrong dish because the tuna was unrecognizable, looking like chopped liver on rice. (See photo). They charged for soy sauce and for wasabi which I have never seen before at a Japanese restaurant. They are trying to get rid of the American influences so did not have the American whiskies on the menu. The food was doused in butter and you could hardly taste the Japanese flavors in any of the dishes. My lips were puckered because the food is so over salted. And to seal the deal, we found a hair mixed into the rice of our chirashi. I will not be coming back. At the end of our meal, the a server came out and let us know he saw our review. Rather than apologizing for the poor service and our bad experience, he could not have been more unkind. One of the wait staff walked us out of the restaurant telling us how pathetic we are. To call one pathetic is incredibly rude, especially to customers in the service industry who simply voiced their opinions of a bad experience on yelp.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

This is the absolute worst McDonald's in the history of McDonald's there is no rhyme or reason to how they take orders in the 2 lane drive thru-sit back and enjoy your 30 minute wait as at least 3 cars that arrived after you get there orders taken before you. Once you've finally made your way to the first window you'll hand your money to someone wearing their mask under there nose. But we're not through yet-you still have to traverse the final window where you're guaranteed to be shorted at least one burger if you don't double check the bag. And when you do tell them they shorted you also be prepared to hand the bag back to them so they can rifle through it and knock all the fries to the bottom of the bag.

When I ordered my food, I expressed that I have a dairy allergy. This wasn't an issue, no cheese was placed on my English Muffin. The issue was that the options they gave me, after telling them that I had a dairy allergy, contained dairy. I heard the lady in the back saying to the lady at the window that the alternative they recommended contained dairy. She tried to hand it to me and so I promptly asked what the lady in the back was saying about my drink, in fact, containing milk.

This is a serious health hazard!! I know it is super annoying to have specific orders, but come on people! The lady then took my order back and dumped it out and used the same cup.. do you not understand how allergies work? I just left and didn't argue with her and threw my drink away.

What a first seemed like a charming outdoor seating area soon became the place for a most dismal meal.  After waiting 20 minutes for anyone to come over and ask us if we wanted drinks, we ordered the eggplant pizza and the vegetable panini. After another 20-30 minutes we received our food.

"The level of incompetence in this store can *almost* not be put into words. First, I *LOVE* Chipotle food, but between this and the US31 Greenwood location, I'm beginning to think they need to steal a Chik-Fil-A engineer to save this company. Today I ordered a single bowl with chicken, brown rice, black beans, extra pico, light hot, sour cream, cheese and lettuce, and a medium salsa and chips. A pretty simple order. The app errored out, I resubmitted and it went through. I get inside to pick it up and there's no record of my order. No big deal. I'm happy to give them my order again and there's no line. Took them a few minutes to make this executive decision, but they got there. The preparer gets to the chicken and puts one maybe two tablespoons of chicken in it and looks at me like, ""did you notice?"" Yes, I noticed. I don't mind waiting for more chicken. He says it will be 5 minutes. I'm still being understanding and patient at this point. These kids have let some Karen who came in after me who is now ahead of me ramble on for the entire 15 minutes and the line is now 10-15 people deep. 5 minutes turns into 10 with the chicken and I'm happy to switch to barbacoa, squirrel, I don't care at this point. Rice, beans, [screams internally, ""what the hell is that?!""] a GIANT piece of barbacoa that was not shredded down gets thrown into my bowl, the now second preparer poke at it like she knows it's wrong, but moves along. She finishes the bowl and fills a cup with my salsa. No chips, no bag, back to the first preparer, who tries handing it over the sneeze guard. ""A bag and some chips please?"" A little powwow with 4 workers and few more minutes and they return with my chips and a bag. [sarcastic internal, ""Praise Jesus!""]  A word of advice to whoever from Chipotle is reading this. Teach these kids two important things. First, treat each meal as if you were on the other side of the counter and someone was making your food this way. Is it acceptable?

I will never order from here again and would urge you to do the same. The Grubhub reviews seem to state that this happens all the time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"A terrible place to have Chinese food. If you like Chinese cuisine, you should never go here. Unclean tables, horrible food. To top it all, when we got our bill, the rude waitress charged more than the price of the items on the menu. When pointed it out, the lady tried to justify instead of saying sorry. When we said, we're not coming here again, the waitress goes: ""I don't care if you come here again or not?! Wow really?!

Disappointed in the service.  Place was about half full on a Friday evening when we arrived.  The empty tables were all dirty so we figured it would be just a couple of minutes to clean one up so that we could be seated.  We sat there for probably 15 minutes and felt completely ignored.  No tables were cleaned and the staff didn't seem to interested in getting us seated.  We finally gave up and walked down to Padero Beach Grill where we were quickly served.  We were fired up for some good pizza but never got the opportunity.  They may have great food for all I know but they should work on improving their customer service.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Upsize drinks without asking. Who wants a   A 22 ounce milk after asking for a small one?   Over many visits I've found service with the exception of ONE WEEKDAY waitress to be really bad. Weekend service is bad. Think the ""s "" word.   The milk issue was resolved not by me getting a normal sized milk for instance 8 to 10 ounces bur getting a 16 ounce replacement AFTER she argued with me this was the only small size. Looking around i see 8 ouncers for juice which i clearly expected when i twice asked for "" small""  Add insult to injury and i hear 2 of the staff talking about me because i wanted a smaller drink.  I have to add i was polite but the rest of my meal was delivered with no verbal interaction from the waitress.  Waitressing is Hard. So i am a a 20% and up tipper. But today I am glad i am a cash only diner because tipping was in line with my experience. 10%.

Yesterday I was craving roti and curry chicken. There is a popular Jamaican restaurant that I normally would go to but I didn't feel like driving that far. I looked on yelp and saw that Caribbean Crown had fairly good reviews. My son and I went to this restaurant and the lady that took out order was very nice. Once we got back and started eating I was immediately disappointed in the curry and roti. The roti was dry and the curry didn't have any flavor. It was very basic. The fried rice and collards were just as bland. I wasn't able to eat the rest as I was so disappointed. My son is a teenager and will eat almost anything so he finished the rest. Today my son woke up very sick and I have been sick as well. This is the only thing that my son and I ate in common. We will never eat here again.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I use to think this was a great local joint to stop by and have a few drinks and some food. But just recently my opinion has changed.   The staff has absolutely no personality. I called my order ahead of time (2 cold sandwiches) to give them time in case they were having a lunch rush.  The girl on the phone said to give them at least 15 minutes to get it ready. We gave them at least 30 minutes. When we arrived to pick up our order, the order wasn't ready. I looked around and they were not busy. 3 other older couples sitting and eating there pizza. I was very confused how 2 simple sandwiches wouldn't be possibly ready??  The girl at the counter was also not helpful. She asked 3 times what the name was on the order and looked around for it. She then finally just pointed fingers to another girl stating that person had taken the order. It seemed liked they hadn't even started making the sandwiches and not once did the gal at the counter say they weren't even ready or close to being ready. She also didn't even apologize for the inconvenience.   We sat at a table for another 15 minutes before it finally came out. And a different girl brought it out place it on the table and said ""here you go."" Not once did she smile or even said I'm sorry about the wait. She just walked away.  I was not impressed with their overall service. Everyone that works there acts like they hate working there or just doesn't want to be there.

I stood up to leave, walked back over to the bar and she finally said, very shortly, what can I get ya? Two other couples came up and got the same service. She acts like I'm inconveniencing her. I asked for more water please and she took my cup without saying a word. She ate before people got their drinks and had hot Cheetos under her finger nails. I ordered the Cajun combination.

"My wife and I were so excited to enjoy a great meal for my birthday, also knowing having a 15$ coupon would make it even more enjoyable. Nothing hurt more than being told by the waitress at the end of our meal that she could not apply the coupon because the meal we received was another offer. An offer cannot be applied to an offer. If I had read the tiny print, perhaps I would have known that also.   However, it was unfortunate the waitress expressed no interest to help us out, as it was an expensive dinner. Perhaps if I became more dramatic, further action would have been taken. But I am not the type to do that.  In addition, it turns out a manager or district manager was present in the restaurant. I had asked my waitress who he was because my wife and I were uncomfortable by how much he was staring at us from the bar, pizza bar, and kitchen.

I've been to it's nuts on Route 29 Titusville and we always enjoyed eating there. However the Lambertville location was just a horrible experience. I called to order two dinners of fried chicken. I asked the woman on the phone how long it would be until the food would be ready she said to come now. When I arrived they told me that the french fries were not cooked and it would be a wait. I'm waiting for 10 minutes and they didn't even cook my fries yet. I told her I didn't want to wait anymore to just give me mashed potatoes instead. So she proceeded to hand me my food and it seems like it was a bit much. I ordered two dinners with two pieces of chicken each and she gave me 12 pieces of chicken. There were people standing around and obviously not caring about my order I had put in. I will never go back I think the service and the food is not good at all.

"Tonight was my first experience at Sportsman's Grille in the Vandy/Hillsboro Village area. When we arrived we were seated at a table where there were ants crawling on it. I asked the server if we could be moved and she moved us with no problem. After a minute or two at the new table (in a different part of the restaurant) I noticed ants on the new table as well. I switched my boyfriend spots (I was originally sitting against the wall) and let it go for the time being.   Two of our friends joined us and we ordered our meals. My friend ordered the Mexicana Burger with everything on the side, when it arrived it had only the salsa on the side and everything else was on it. My boyfriend ordered the bacon cheeseburger and when it came there was no bacon on it. My meal and our other friend's meal came out fine. Towards the end of the meal I noticed an ant in my coke. When the server brought us our checks I expressed my concerns about the ants on our table and in my drink, her response was simply ""Yeah...it's the summer, we're trying to work on it"" without even an apology or an offer to discount our meals.   When she came back to take our credit cards (my boyfriend and I were on one check and our other two friends were on one together) we told her we would like to split the cost of the bill down the middle on both cards (our friends did the same). About 15 minutes after she took our cards (during that time I found another ant in my water) she finally returned them with the checks to sign. I noticed that she had not split our bill correctly and in fact, the amounts on my boyfriends receipt and on mine were not the same and added up to almost $3.00 more than what the total of our bill was (our friend's receipts also added up to more than the cost of their bill).   While I'm not one to complain about $3.00, I will complain about being over charged while dining with ants on our table & in our drinks and the food not coming out correctly and it taking so long for her to run our cards. I do not recommend this place and I will not be returning.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Came here because I have a certification program in Brandon and I like to come to Brandon ahead of the traffic and have a drink before class. This location is in Brandon Town Center, a mall that reminds me of Wiregrass. I'd never been here. The location seemed mismanaged from the start, as a young hostess didn't know if it was happy hour and couldn't tell us what to order for happy hour specials to apply. We ended up not ordering happy hour drinks because we had no one to advise us which to order and paid full price. Our server didn't show up for half an hour, which may not have been her fault, I don't know. Perhaps they were understaffed, but it wasn't busy when this occurred. The drinks came and they were pretty good, classic island beverages. I got a Zombie with a cute stirrer in it. Meanwhile a new waitress served the table next to ours and we watched her come and go six times for every one time we laid eyes on our waitress. Then the food, so blah. Four appetizers- beef empanadas, hummus, onion rings and spinach dip and all were ordinary and unimaginative. Sadly the onion rings were probably the best because they had coconut.

1 star for the decent food and minus 4 for the terrible customer service. This is the third and final time I will give this place a thought. They turned our business away at 6:30 with 4 adults and 6 kids with more than half the restaurant empty. The first incident came when we had a reservation for 30 people and when we got there they only gave us space for half and told us we couldn't take another table because it was for another party that wasn't coming for another hour and a half.

"Been trying all the delivery pizza places in the IV, Goleta area. This place is by far the WORST. Ordered the thin crust Pesto pizza, Sicilian wings, and antipasto salad. We ordered over $20 worth of food so we got a choice of free garlic or foccacia bread, we opted for foccacia.  First of all, the pizza, which claimed to be ""a flavor lovers pizza"" was almost flavorLESS. It was intensely oily, even on the bottom of the pizza, and we were given regular crust instead of thin. We never received the wings so I cant say whether they were good or not, but in consistency with the rest of this place, i cant say i had high hopes for them. There was no dressing included with the salad and none tossed into it either. We also were given garlic bread instead of the foccacia bread we asked for.  We already had a feeling the service at this place wasnt very good when it took them an hour and 20 minutes to deliver to us (we are only a mile away), but it got even worse when we called to complain... We were told that ""the dressing we did not receive is only a sauce so it's not that big of a deal"" even though its almost a 10 dollar salad, and is worthless with no dressing. They didn't remove the wing charge from our bill, and they made constant excuses on every aspect of the failed order, not even apologizing or using a single shred of customer service skills.

"It's really beyond comprehension how this place keeps a 4 star review. I've given it 4 chances, FOUR. I only waited until now to post this review because I really wanted to see this place thrive because I live in the neighborhood. The service is hit or miss, but mostly miss. The food is bland at most, and the staff just isn't that friendly. I was going to give it at least 2 stars because at least the mini maple butter biscuits are good, but my last visit pushed me over the edge because we entered a half empty restaurant with glasses of ice water already set on every table. I'm sorry, that's not even acceptable for a busy venue. I've questioned the cleanliness of this place before, but that proved to show their carelessness. I can't bring myself to drink from a glass that god knows who has already touched. Bad call BBB.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"NEVER go here! Total RIP OFF! First it's Mexican and with Mexican food you get chips and salsa for free. This hell hole charges 2.99 for a small bowl and it's not refillable. Every bowl is 2.99! Next, the prices are a rip off. 3 tacos and a drink are 12.00+. Again a total rip off. Then the rest of the memo is a joke and rip off as well along with their crappy buffet and ala cart rip off prices. The place is dirty and then there's the bathroom. Mens bathroom Looked like someone ate the spiciest Mexican food and had explosive diarrhea all over the place, along with graffiti, curse words, and more written all over the place. Yeah, this is a place I want spend my money. NOT!!! The point is that the owners only seem to care about serving cheap food, small portions at rip off prices, F*CK THAT.

The food here was just average and definitely not worth the price. Service was ok but nothing special. Food took a long time and tasted like frozen reheated.

"Online ordering wasn't working and said the place was closed. I'm used to ordering late here so I called; big mistake. Reached a very very rude guy who just said they were open until 10pm on Sundays; it was just after 9pm so I ask why the online ordering wasn't working. He didn't like that question and repeated they were open until 10pm and he didn't know anything about online ordering. I went ahead and ordered over the phone although the guy didn't seem to want to be bothered. I ordered a 12"" thin crust with sausage, mushrooms, and onion. He said it'll be 30 minutes and he was good on that. I tipped the delivery guy and got ready to enjoy my pizza. It was not the this crust I ordered; I assume what i got was their regular crust. It was thick, doughy and generally awful. The ingredients did not stand up well to that thick crust and the crust itself way too chewy and had a lousy taste. It was too late to call and complain, not that it would have done any good. Their thin crust is okay and that is all I've ever ordered. I was starving and managed to eat 2 slices but it. Wasn't a pleasant experience. What a waste of money. The rest of this pie is not worth saving for leftovers; into the trash.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! The food is not bad, but the service is horrible! The first Korean restaurant I've been to where the side dishes are not unlimited. We had 3 people in the group and out of the 10 side dishes offered, they only offer 3 refills. And even those 3 refills are not unlimited, meaning if out of the 10 side dishes you only like 3 of them, then too bad, you'll only get them refilled once. Also, let me repeat, the services were horrible, considered we spent over $100 on the meal, and a 18% tip is charged automatically, you think they would care about their customers a little... The truth is, not at all, they never show up unless we ask for something. No one asked how the meal was or even smiled at us....

"While staying at the hotel and experiencing great things on the hotel side, I thought, after putting in a 12+ hour day, I would just stroll downstairs to the restaurant and enjoy some grub and drink, to unwind from the day.  Great decor and atmosphere.  Wide selection of hard liquor.  Tv's at the bar for the sports people.  And unfortunately, that's where all the good things ended during my experience.  Walked in and  I counted only 10 tables with people at them.  Bar was 1/2 to 3/4 full.  So, not really a busy evening.  Saddled up to the left side of the bar and it took literally 7+ minutes before the server offered an initial greeting.  While sipping on the cocktail and browsing the menu, I decided on oysters as app and cheeseburger as main.  Menu has unique choices and most sounded pretty good.  But for this night, I went with old reliable.   After finishing my 1st drink, I was ready for round 2.  It took the bartender 11+ minutes to return to our side of the bar and ask everyone if they needed anything else.   To top it off, the oysters came out at the same time as the burger.  Was I suppose to eat the hot burger first, while the chilled oysters sit on ice and possibly stay cold until I finish the burger?  Maybe that is the game plan management has for their patrons. Not sure.   What I am sure of is this....My F&B experience only consists of 3 years bar tending and 2 years serving.....so not a very lengthy career in that field. But the principles and basics were the same then as they are now. Quick initial greeting, appetizers out before main dishes, consistent follow up to patrons.    At Heritage, If you want service at the bar, sit on the right 1/4 of the bar, be ready to order drinks, dinner, and dessert all in the first visit by staff.  It's a shame the ironic experiences between the hotel and restaurant, located in the same building.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I went here for the first time with my husband for lunch based on the good Yelp reviews. It's a small restaurant, and was not crowded.  There were only 3 other parties dining when we arrived.  We were greeted quickly and served bread with an olive oil/pesto dip.  The oil-to-pesto ratio was too high and the bread was nothing special, but it was nice to have something to nibble on.  We quickly ordered drinks and our entrees.  I was on my lunch break from work and didn't want the meal to take more than an hour.  I typically have no problems with this at any of my other lunch spots in Tarpon. I began to get concerned about timing here when it took about 10 minutes for our iced tea to arrive. Our server only had two other tables, but had no sense of urgency.  Both my husband and I agreed that the iced tea had an unusual flavor too, almost like it was tea from a can.    It ended up taking 50 minutes for our food to arrive. I was very close to just walking out before the food came, but I had already devoted so much time to the meal. We weren't the only table that had to wait a long time for their food.  We had been there about 40 minutes when two other tables seated before us received their entrees.    My husband had the Gyro which he said was good, but nothing special.  I had ordered the Ultimate Wrap, which had both chicken and pork.  Both meats were seasoned and cooked very well, and the red pepper feta sauce on the wrap was delicious.  We both also had the French fries with a dill/feta sauce for a side.  The fries were just ok, and it's hard for me not to love any fries with cheese sauce.     Although the food was decent, I could not enjoy my meal because I was stressed about getting back to work.  As soon as the food was dropped I asked for the check.  Server came back about 5 minutes later - to ask how everything was - and didn't bring the check. After another reminder, we finally got the check and a to-go box since I didn't have time to finish my meal.    Bottom line - I won't be returning to this restaurant.  There are much better Greek places with better service in the Tarpon area.  The customers at the restaurant all appeared to be retiree aged and enjoying their meals.  Maybe this is the usual crowd, and the kitchen/servers are not used to having customers on any sort of timeline?  If you don't mind waiting a ridiculous amount of time for a mediocre meal - then I suggest you give this place a try.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

My food was thrown in haphazardly and I deemed it to be unsafe to eat. I contacted the store and the app for help and a refund but will no longer be ordering from chipotle at this location.

"Honestly I was super excited to have this addition to the neighborhood as I was devastated to see the existing Mi-Lah vegan restaurant gone, as Ambler is far, although I still make that trip out sometimes for Mi Lah there.   Unfortunately, for what this menu offers,  what I ordered was not up to my standards in taste AT All.   I got my favorites that I enjoy everywhere else in the USA and this is the most disappointing yet.  Shaking Beef and Chargrilled pork summer rolls. Other favorites would have been the pork chop or chargrilled pork with broken rice or vermicelli, or Pho tai. But alas I cannot order the whole menu on my own in one sitting  The Shaking beef had a smell to it that was suspicious, I can't tell if it was fishy, freezer burnt, or old beef, and the beef chunks were gray in color. Like pre-frozen and cooked while cold. The pieces were thicker cut and over cooked so they were tough to chew.  There also lacked any flavor to the beef and looked like it just had a sprinkle of pepper and that's it. Nothing that I am used to in a classic and saucily, deliciously and correctly prepared Shaky or shaking beef. Depending on who prints the menu. As you see in the picture the presentation and color of meal was lack luster for that price.   As for the grilled pork rolls, again the entire dish was off. The rice noodles were a thicker cut and not of my favorite styles I usually get. It overwhelmed the roll and left the taste of the roll bland as the noodle was tasteless. The usual suspects in the roll in terms of mint or any herb besides a a measly little ice berg lettuce was missing. Was it there? I didn't notice or taste it. I grabbed some mint from my garden. The pork again was thick cut, over done and hard to chew, not much in, and again not very seasoned, like you expect of your chargrilled pork at other establishments. The peanut dipping sauce was not a sauce. It was a paste of plainly flavored peanut, and not what you come to love and expect for your interestingly deep flavored peanut sauces you get with your summer rolls.   I will review it again after sampling the Pho. Maybe that is all they will be good for? I wouldn't know.  For the price, ANY Vietnamese restaurant on Washington Ave supersedes this place. For $20 for this small dish and rolls, it is not worth it. I can get 2 entrees and rolls for same price and better tasting on wash ave.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Hey, went to the ""grand reopening"" of this diner in Upper Darby. It took long enough, a little over six months from owners mouth to my ears. Well not much to say except the owners are the same and what bothers me is the husband and wife talk greek to each other probably about the customer which includes me because I complained about the food. Let me explain, the coffee tasted like water with a meer after taste of coffee. So sad because they had  really good coffee before the fire. My husband ordered the Big Man breakfast...eggs, pancakes potatoes and bacon. OMG! The bacon was undercooked, basically raw in the center of every strip! So with that I couldn't finish my omelet, so I ate my toast because you can't screw up toast right? So back to the bacon, I had to wait 5 minutes for the waitress who was huddled with the other waitresses behind the counter talking or complaining about their tips being below 20%.... blah blah blah, IF you have been there since they ""reopened"" well you know what I  mean. I tasted everything my husband had in his breakfast and well Llanerch is good at 2am when the bars/clubs close and you need to eat something to absorb the alcohol in your system and everything is delicious because you're taste buds are dead!!! Can't believe they reopened, when it really should have been bulldozed!!! The bill came to $27.50, for bacon, eggs, and toast. My husband's breakfast, $12.95 really way over priced seriously for 12.95 it should have been perfect! All that diner is in it for the money of horribly cooked overpriced food and oh btw as far as interior improvements, a wall of mirror to make the inside appear bigger and new seating ie, booths but you don't go there for the ambiance you go there for the food which in my opinion Sucks!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"This place was horrible!  Our first visit was on a Sunday around noon.  There were two men at the bar, but no other tables.  Our server seemed very flustered even so.  She greeted us, but could barely get her words out correctly.  She had to start over as she was greeting us, then explained that ""she had worked the previous night until 3am and hadn't gotten to bed until 5 am, so she was extremely hungover, overworked, and exhausted.""  Not something I want to hear from my server!  The other servers were all gabbing at a booth a few down from us.  ""I'm tired.....I'm cold......Its slow....This is ridiculous.....I'm never going to make enough money....yadda yadda yadda.""  Also not what I want to hear.  She brought our drinks and asked for our order.  I happen to like to modify the crap out of things.  I ordered a side salad to be out first and the club, untoasted, mayo on the side, add swiss, with chips.  She laughed and told me to wait while she went to get her book to write it down because it was too much.  When she came back, I repeated my order and my boyfriend ordered the steak special (8oz steak with side for $10).  I also added that I would like a bloody mary.  She proceeded to tell me that they used to have specials on those during football, but not anymore, plus, it's soooooo slow now that football is over.  Way to tell me how great the place is!  My salad came about 5 minutes later.  My drink had still not arrived and she did not speak of it.  I saw the bartender was only focused on her two customers at the bar, so I assumed this is why.  After finishing my salad, while listening to our server and the others complaining a few booths down, I was a little annoyed.  I decided I would just tell her to forget the drink.  Then I hear the bartender yell over to her, ""Melanie, you know your have a drink up?""  She disappeared to the other side of the bar and didn't return with my drink for another 5 minutes.  This was even after our food came.  My sandwich was ok, although it had mayo ON it, and on the side.  The chips were dreadful, they seemed to be re dipped in the deepfryer.  My boyfriend said the steak was terrible.  I have never seen him not finish a steak, EVER! (Also, he has been sick and throwing up ALL day, beginning about 30 minutes after our meal)  There was another couple that came in after us that also looked very unhappy with their experience as well.  Needless to say, I completely stiffed the girl on a tip, which I felt horrible about because we have both been in the service industry, so that is very very rare that we would even think to tip under 20%.  I decided to call and let the manager know about our experience afterward.  I told him I called, instead of speaking to him when we were there because I didn't want anything offered for free to come back.  I was very polite to him and told him all of this.  He seemed unsurprised by the service, but shocked that the food wasn't good.  However, I feel that he was just listening and probably won't do anything to better the place.  I would not recommend this at all!  We will sooooo not be back, but hey, at least now we know.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"My girlfriend is from New York and was craving a good bagel, so we went to this place. Long story short, we both left feeling repulsed. The place was an absolute hole, felt like everything you touched was dirty or sticky. Very crummy. I ordered a bagel with egg, bacon, and cheese. The bagel itself was fine; albeit the applicator of the Asiago was quite stingy, however, the 2 pieces of thin microwaved bacon left much to be desired, as did neon orange processed cheese. No type of spread on the bagel, very dry and unsatisfactory. I peered over the dingy counter into the queens workspace and was petrified at how unsanitary the conditions were. Cheese and butter sitting out, knives being wiped with a dirty towel, and what made me question my existence was her reaching down to pull napkins off her shoes, without gloves of course.

"Food isn't bad here but when service is bad it ruins the whole meal. Our waitress Patty was indifferent and more interested in the larger table than our lowly table of three. She was missing in action for the most part. She didn't serve our food, someone else did and my Aunt only got the chicken portion of her meal, her pasta and veggies came when she was halfway through her chicken. Had to flag someone down to get the sodas we ordered when we first sat down, they came near the end of our meal with no apologies for the wait. I asked for butter for my bread, you'd think I asked for something foreign. Someone else brought out four slices they obviously sliced off a stick of butter and put on a saucer of all things. We had to flag someone down again to get the dessert menu. Someone else brought dessert. When Patty finally showed up again with our check, she had the nerve to circle the gratuity suggestion in a red heart. Sorry Patty, no big tip for you. You were too interested in that larger party who was probably only there for a one time dinner. Our lowly table of three would have tipped big if you'd only stopped by our table once or twice to see if we needed anything or at least got what we ordered.

And charcoal burned. Then I order the cabbage, potatoes and carrots in turmeric. One of my favorite dishes. Two slices of carrots. Two leaves of cabbage. Literally one small potato cube and -- TURMERIC so overwhelming that it was bitter and sour at once. I need to try Cafe Desta... sad.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I believe in supporting local business, I am a big advocate of it, but what I will not support is spending my hard earned money and be disrespected.  This establishment has a reputation of being a Christian based business, and I appreciate that idea.  However your staff should adopt some similar ideas or attitudes to reflect that as well.   I came in with a friend of mine the morning of the 26th, and the heavy-set, long-haired lady behind the counter was the rudest I have seen in a long time.  The interaction between her and us was bad enough that I only half ate my meal.  I vowed I would never come back, and had your competitor been open that day, I would have turned around and gone there instead.

This place is a service nightmare. We arrived at 7:15 on a Saturday and were told the wait was 15-20 minutes. We went to the bar to grab a drink where we waited for 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us and then we were asked three times if we wanted something - we repeated our simple drink order three times and it was another 10 minutes before we even got a drink. At that point our table was ready. We ordered a burger each - there were only two of us - and a side of onion rings. 35 minutes later we finally got our food and were told our onion rings were cold so they were re-making them. All this for a burger??? Really??? The only positive I can say is that the burgers were decent and they acknowledged the wait with a 15% discount. But I've had far better burgers elsewhere with a far better service experience.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Aug 13th: 5 stars: great food, decent patio, great service, we will return!  The chips are perfect, the salsa good (kinda reminds me of Chevy's....not my fave, but good).  I ordered the carne asada street tacos & they were amazing!  The steak flavor was perfect, tender & not chewy!  I can't wait to go back & try more!  Sept 3rd: 1 star: slow service, incorrect food, incorrect check.  I was so excited to go back to La Tia's, but it took forever for a waitress to greet us on the patio.  I ordered the carne asada street tacos, but received the carne asada w/ a side of flour tortillas. I told the waitress I'd just make my own tacos if she brought corn tortillas & she admitted she'd entered the wrong order. It took forever for the check to arrive & when it did we were charged for the carne asada which is $4 more than the street tacos. My husband said it needed to be corrected & he was told ""well she ate it!""  Finally it was reduced by only $3 & we just gave up & left because the entire process had taken so long!  However, the carne asada wasn't even that good!! The flavor was ok, but it was SO chewy unlike last time.  Also my husband had a margarita which was excellent 3 weeks ago & today had a funny taste to it that we couldn't pin point.

I only go back because it's the only one near me and I'd have to drive another 15-20 minutes to go to another one. They need new employees, managers or headsets...something because they literally cannot comprehend an order. Take the extra time and drive to Brentwood if you can.

"I am pretty forgiving and don't review much, but I the experience here deserves a warning to those who read the other reviews and need to know what they're getting into.  I have to say that there wasn't any one major item that was terribly wrong, but the cumulative little things combined to make this a dinner I'd just rather just forget.  First, the setting and ambiance.  The other reviewer was right, it is stuck in a time warp, but not from the 40's or 50's as I'd imagined, more like the 70's, and not in a good way.  It is below grade (""La Buca"" translates to ""the hole"" or ""pit,"" i.e., basement), with ceiling tiles and it is generally kind of shabby. Also, the lighting in the dining room is way too bright. The coatroom had hangers with tickets on them, but it was self-serve.  No big deal. There is a bar up front, where the drinks looked generous, but we went straight to the table.  The service is SLOW, from the moment we walked in we waited to have our reservation checked, and when seated it just took a long time to get everything.  It seemed the servers did a lot of walking back and forth, sometimes with carts to deliver food, but often they seemed to be scampering around with nothing to do.    The bread would have been good if it were fresh, and when I asked the server for olive oil, he told me all the bottles were being used and they didn't have any others.  This in spite of the two tables nearby whose diners were clearly finished with them, he didn't have the sense to retrieve one.  Ok.   We ordered a bottle of wine, a nice Gavi for $40, and it was fine.  The food, when it finally arrived, was just ok.  I ordered one of the specials, which included choices.  I had the Caesar salad, penne arrabbiata, and breaded chicken breast topped with prosciutto and mozzarella.  The salad was ok, the penne was not spicy at all, but the chicken was actually pretty good. By the time it got to that course, though, it was too late. My companion ordered the pasta with mushrooms, and the sauce was really bland and not very appetizing.  We left without even waiting for dessert, which was included with the meal.  Just not worth the time, and if you've ever been in a situation like this, you know there's no way a dessert can redeem the meal.  Best to cut your losses and run.  As my dining companion observed, this place is for people who don't know any better, and I can't agree more, especially with all the terrific other options for Italian food in Philadelphia.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Absolutely terrible customer service. We decided to support local and had a buy one get one free coupon. We checked the website and it showed take out only so  I went in to pick up our food and they wouldn't honor the coupon because it was ""dine in only"" which is not stated on the coupon but regardless they said they aren't honoring coupons right now. When I called in the order I told the gal that I had a coupon and she said they would deduct it when we came in to pick up the food. This is the first and last time I will be going there. I'm guessing it was the manager but a man came out to ""apologize"" and made the situation worse stating that he was sorry but they are just trying to keep their doors open. Customer service is going above and beyond expectations and not just seeing a dollar sign for each person who walks in. So disappointing",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"The food and service has definitely gone down hill since the last time I visited.  I wouldn't go back again for the food.  But more notable to me was the owner Jimmie's treatment of me, a long-time customer.  He has old, sharp edged bistro chairs that tore into my pants causing a dime sized hole/tear in my pant bottoms. The employee called him on the spot when she saw what had happened and Jimmie acted like he was going to take care of it.  All I got was the run around and delay tactics for the next 8-9 weeks. I finally wised up and realized that even after 3-4 pleasant exchanges, he was just stringing me along and pretending he was going to reimburse me but had no intent on doing so.  Why not just do the right thing Jimmie?  Really sad way to behave as a business owner when someone alerts you to a situation in your restaurant that could prove dangerous in the future if it cuts someone's body and not just their pants.  He never reimbursed me, and I am no longer interested in pursuing this man hoping he will do the honorable thing.

"Came for a birthday for a fairly large party on taco Tuesday so we were prepared to wait and showed up an hour before the birthday girl was planning on getting there to get our name in for a table. We waited for TWO hours, watching the hostess giving tables away because they said they only had one big table that we had to wait for and when we asked if they could push them together, probably an hour into the wait, the hostess responded I don't THINK we can do that. It wasn't toward the end of the 2nd hour of waiting a second hostess came out and told her our issue and about the tables and she told us that was a great idea to put the tables together and doesn't know why no one thought of it sooner!?!?!  I never blame the hostesses for the wait because I know it's not their fault but this was different. There was a clear solution that could've cut our wait time in half. And on top of that my friends went to the bar to get drinks while we waited. We ordered and then waited 20 minutes for the bartender to come over and tell us he didn't have the ingredients for the drinks we ordered. We didn't even order anything obscure or fancy, just drinks off their regular menu. And on top of THAT when my friend went to go check on our table wait, and I had my back turned to watch her and they had bussed her nearly full drink even though I was still sitting right there!

"This restaurant is located in Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport. Inspired by the food and art of legendary Creole chef, Leah Chase, and owned by her family.   I never had the opportunity to go to Dooky Chase's, the restaurant she and her husband ran for more than 50 years. However, I am sure this place in no way serves as a positive representative of her memory.   I came here twice in one week, and had a bad experience both times.   The food tasted great, but it was a rip off. During the first visit, I got a Blue Crab salad, that had very little in the way of crab, and the greens were not very fresh. During the second visit, I got Chicken and Waffles that were overcooked.   In addition to that, the service was horrible.

"This was a huge disappointment. The restaurant was almost empty on a Sunday afternoon at 12:30pm. That should have been a sign. We were seated and given a brunch menu. It was very limited. We asked if the regular menu was available and told it wasn't until 4pm. We decided to stay and give the restaurant a chance even though there was only 1 thing I could order given my gluten intolerance. I asked for an iced tea and was told they don't serve iced tea. Kind of strange but not a big deal. Someone else asked for decaf coffee. Also not available. These seem like just basic things all restaurants should have but again, not catastrophic. Then came the wait time for our meal. It took 45 minutes and there were only 2 other tables with people who had been served long before we were. We finally get our meals and it was okay. Not bad but not great either. I had ordered the Goan shrimp and grits which was supposed to come with basmati rice cakes (according to the menu). When the waitress came by to pick up our plates (she didn't check on us until we were done), I asked her about the rice cakes. She said that a lot on the menu is wrong. She proceeded to tell us that the goat dish (there was only one on the brunch menu) wasn't goat but actually pork. My husband had ordered that dish and doesn't care much for pork and commented to her that if she had told us that prior to him ordering then he wouldn't have chosen that dish. Needless to say, he hadn't finished the dish and didn't really enjoy it. After hearing what the waitress said, it made sense. I asked the waitress if we could please speak to the manager. He came by and we proceeded to tell him all of what I have written. He said that he was unaware that the chef had changed the ingredients for the dishes on the menu and would talk to him. (How is it the waitress knew but he didn't?) He offered an apology and that was it. No offer to take off the charges for 3 of the 4 meals being incorrect and not enjoyed. I asked him to take the charges off the check (very politely) and his response was ""oh, this is where this is going"". I responded that was not where it was going but I did believe we shouldn't have to pay for meals that were misrepresented. He said nothing and just looked at me and then went to change the check. My husband and he exchanged words about his attitude and lack of knowledge of the goings on in the restaurant. This restaurant seemed to have so much potential but I just don't see how it can be improved with the menu being incorrect, the staff incompetent, and the owner not present.

The cucumbers had sat at the salad bar long enough to brown, when the station was restocked they dumped new on top of old. Carrots were slimy.

I was expecting some cabbage or, lettuce and tomatoes/onions on it - nope. I feel like I just added fat to my body without the deliciousness/satisfaction of it.

Horrible that is how I can describe this place. If I can take the 1 star away I will. The service was crappy. I am Latina so I decided to take my family out to lunch when we get here there is nobody there to greet you. We decided to just sit down and when finally saw a waitress we asked for a highchair she said they are infront of the bathroom. Food came out charred (ordered the Chicharon de pollo not burnt chicken). Out of our whole order the o my good thing was the Maduros and the lemonade. When I get up to pay she tells me one price then the other girl comes out and says it's a whole other price. Will never go here or recommend this place to anyone. I will drive all the way to Philadelphia to get real Spanish food or cook it myself!!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Decent-sized somewhat-upscale Mexican restaurant with a limited one-page menu in downtown New Orleans.  The prices are higher than you'd probably expect.  Went with a group of about 12 at lunch today.  When we arrived it was mostly empty so we assumed service would be quick.  We were wrong.    It took nearly an hour to get the first items for some of us, with others being over an hour.  I'd like to say I could rate a dish, but mine never came and the little Asian girl who waited on us never came by to check on us.  I ordered two tacos, one carne asada and one shrimp, so I wouldn't have thought they'd be that hard to make.  They left a water pitcher on the table so we refilled our own glasses.  The wait staff never came by to check on us.  After 1.25 hours someone told her my food never came.  She didn't seem surprised or concerned.  I told her to just cancel it since everybody else was done and we needed to leave.  She didn't even offer an apology, just said okay and walked away.    At least they didn't charge me for the $3 chips and salsa I did get, which were pretty good.  The salsa is more of a darker roasted tomato variety.  The fried plantain chips were an interesting twist (they also give you regular tortilla chips), but not enough for the amount of salsa (and no one came by or offered more).  I tried someone else's guac, which was okay, but not great (no kick to it).    So that was my experience here, no real food, decent salsa and guac, high prices, and really poor service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Sad service at the bar last night. Our party of five thought we snagged a deal heading to the bar to eat and drink. Little did we know it would take over two hours to leave the establishment.  Food took forever. Burgers ordered were over done. We had to track down our serving for more drinks and had to walk to the reception area to try to pay our bill and request a manager. What finally came down the stairs was our server and the manager who said absolutely nothing to us and our bill was completely messed up. We paid and left shortly thereafter but I will not be returning anytime soon. Best of luck to you if you decide to eat there.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

This was the worst lunch experience ever. The bartender took my friend and my order at 1:15 pm. Then she doesn't return until 1:50pm and tells me and my buddy that they messed up the order. The manager walked right by my table and never addressed us.   The bartender then asked us to wait so we can take the food with us. I told them I am on lunch break so I cannot wait for a re-fire on something i never received and I can't eat at my desk when i get back to work. The whole purpose of eating out for lunch is to get away from work and have a mental break. This experience showed that the employees were the ones on a mental break.  The manager was conveniently nowhere to be found as I needed to leave to get back to work. Totally unprofessional establishment run by a deadbeat manager who was wearing a wrinkled pink dress shirt.

"The food was decent, not worth mentioning really. The server took a long time to make it to the table but afterward service was great. The reason for the review at all and the one star was management's rudeness. I would give 0 stars if I could. We visited during Mardi Gras and while surrounded by wigs, mask, and mermaid yoga pants the manager felt it was appropriate to approach our table and tell me that I had to put my jacket back on because my shirt underneath was sleeveless. I completley understand dress codes and proper attire so I quickly appologized and put my jacket back on. The reason this was an issue is despite picking me out while surrounded by other guest dressed far worse and in mermaid pants and tank tops, he also felt it necessary to inform us after I had already covered my distasteful arms that they would have never sat us had they known I was underdressed. This is all occuring while a table of ladies behind us is cursing aloud and waving for their waiter..  Complete disrespect and rudeness from the manager.

"Stopped by for lunch on 10/29/2013.  Wasn't surprised to see a crowd at lunch time, but there were more standing in line than eating.  The drive-thru was backed up severely.  We did notice that the bins had plenty of chicken...amazing to see that because there was only a single cook!  We waited for 20 minutes to get to the cashier taking orders.  Only one cashier at lunch time..wow!  We were informed that they had no soft drinks because the machine was not working.  The only drinks available were tea and water.  No discounts for the drinks not being available.  When we got our food the chicken was cooked but no taste.  They forgot spices I think.  The sides were very small.

"At $11 a pop, I wasn't expecting frozen beef.   For an hour's wait, I wasn't expecting an underseasoned sandwich.   I was so excited for my first authentic Philly cheesesteak experience. Our tour guide, who said he was a naive Philadelphian, said this was the place to go. I was even happier that it was in one of my favorite places in the city: Reading Terminal Market.   The line was outrageous. Nearly 40 people ahead of us on a Sunday around 2:30pm. But, I figured, if our tour guide recommended it, it has 4 stars on Yelp, the line was crazy long and Obama had eaten here before, it must be worth it.   Cue: the biggest letdown in my recent culinary memory.   We ordered the original with hot peppers. This was decent, but lacked seasoning and was sorely lacking on the wiz. It was a tiny schmear at the bottom of the bun. I so wanted to be oohed and awed at some meat+wiz gooey cheesiness that I've read about and seen in so many photos of delectable cheesesteaks. But this did not deliver.   Husband and I always order two different dishes, to maximize our tasting efforts, and then go halfsies (this is basically the best part of marriage, amirite?) I combed through reviews and saw several people enjoyed the Italian cheesesteak, with sharp provolone cheese and broccoli rabe. I was enticed to try something off the beaten path and saw that many other people had ordered the same, so I decided to pull the trigger and get some greens on my meat. Boy, was that a mistake. Both my husband and I could barely finish our halves. The flavor was just so completely off. When I make a decision to eat meat (I am flexitarian and follow a plant-based diet about 85% of the time), I really want it to be worth it. But between spending an hour of my life on line, $25 for two sandwiches, on top of the fact that we had been touring the city all day and I was ravenously hungry, I forced myself to finish it beyond my own desires.   I've had much better cheesesteaks outside of Philly, sad to say.  It hurts to give this one star if only because the staff were really friendly, despite the never ending line. They were grilling and prepping the sandwiches faster than humanely possible. I rarely tip at a take-away counter but I did so here just because I was in awe of their speed and the fact that they still were pleasant and smiling after serving hundreds of cheesesteaks all day. I just wish one of them warned me against the Italian and told me to get extra meat and extra cheese on the original.  -4 stars for the overly lengthy wait for sub-par, overpriced, frozen meat sandwiches. One hour, $25 and a meat-inclusive meal I'll never get back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"My bf and I went to the Korea Garden Restaurant at Dekalb Pike, Blue Bell, PA for dinner last weekend. We arrived at around 9pm. We were seated prompty and our orders taken shortly after that. We started to enjoy our appetizers/soup and were looking forward to our entrees. We noticed there were some flies though. I was so unpleasantly shocked and disappointed with my 'spicy fried pork with vegetables' when it came. It was a horrible experience. The pieces of pork were served in great huge junks (size of an egg) of THICK FAT & SKIN that seemed to 'wobble' with very little lean meat. The taste was ok, but not spicy or delicious. It was so hard to eat as I had to remove the fat before I could eat it and it was not easy to remove as the pork was so thick. I had to give it up after struggling with it for 10 minutes. We informed our waitress but she was not polite or courteous as she explained that was how the pork came and how they cooked it along with the fat without cutting it off. Incredible! I had never known of any restaurants serving huge junks of FAT. She was so defensive and wasn't happy that I complained about the fat. I wanted to order something else but she said the cook had left. It was only 9.45pm. We ordered some ice cream after that. I suspected that she combined something slimy like mucus or something into my ice cream because I did taste something slimy at the bottom of the ice cream. She might have spat her mucus into my ice cream!  I will NEVER go to that DREADFUL restaurant again!  It was a terrible mistake!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

He wouldn't give me his name to file a complaint and wouldn't let me in the store to talk to management about his attitude, which would've been pointless if my previous encounters with the staff and owner were and indication of how hopeless a resolution would've been.

"Strange as it is, I have a really hard time reviewing my favorite restaurants.  It always feels like I come across as advertising them more than any customer should.  It's just that I'm passionate about food and when I like a place, I *really* like a place.  Joe Bob's Chicken Joint is the best Joe Bob's location.  It has the best cook, the coldest beer and the friendliest service.  The sign outside that says their wings are cold, their beer is warm and their waitresses are ugly isn't funny... but inside, it's all good.  They have Blue Moon on tap, they had some Hemp Ale for a while, they have a pretty decent happy hour... but most importantly, they have the best wings on the planet.  I've been to Buffalo, NY and eaten the best wings they had to offer.  I've sampled some succulent Chinese chicken, Thai and Veitnamese offerings, even Jamaican Jerk.  Sometimes, I'm in the mood for cheap and greasy Wingstreet Wings, but for big, juicy, crispy, perfectly cooked, high quality wings, Joe Bob's can't be beat.  Super Hell's Fire with Extra Bleu Cheese is the way to go.  If you aren't into the spicy side though, there's Thai seasoning, BBQ, plain and less hot varieties of Super Hell's Fire.  If you come to the Reno/Sparks area and don't eat at Joe Bob's, you failed in your visit.  Even if it's for a funeral and you're grief stricken, you still have to eat here.  Seriously.

I really think the owners of this place just don't give a rat's behind.  Went there on a Saturday night and there were plenty of empty seats.  We were a party of 3 and were seated immediately at a table where I felt the rush of cold air each time the front door opened.  I had to get up and grab a menu at the desk as we were not given menus when seated.  Waitress came over to take our order yet the others in my party didn't have menus.    We were given a pot of tea and it was filled half way, enough for about two cups each.  Placed our orders and in about 5 minutes, my entree arrived, lamb with cabbage and onions in hot oil.  Yet my wife and daughter had to wait about 10 minutes for their entrees to arrive.  One positive tonight: we had a full bowl of rice, almost enough for 3.  But it was cold by the time the other entrees arrived.   This is not the first time this has happened to me.  Why can't we all be served at the same time?  A rhetorical question because I would probably see cows fly before I would get a reply from the manager or owner of this place.  Many yelpers complain about lousy service, but nothing changes.  But judging from the clientele during my visit, I guess they have lower service standards, so why change?     Decent food, rotten service.

Stopped eating the food when we realized that there were ANTS crawling on the plates and napkins that the waitress pulled from under the bar.

We have always paid by check, however, the girl on the phone rudely stated ""dont you understand we only accept visa or cash. We accepted and paid by cc. When we received the pizza we discovered that the pizza was deep dish. usually we get thin style.  We already had a horrible time ordering from them we decided just to eat something else. This was not a true pizza. I don't understand how a company like this can stay in business. The last part of this was the female on the other end asked us if we would like some ranch, we said sure.

Came in with 4 of my co-workers during our lunch break and there were multiple tables open but apparently there was a large group coming in and the back dining room was completely full (which I doubt).

Her: ""Oh well thanks for coming back! Can I start you off with iced water? "" About 2 minutes later another waitress came over and recited the same... exact.... speech. We told her we were already being helped so she was confused. When everyone's food came out, mine didn't. Waitress walked away, came back a few minutes later and said they had to remake my burger so it will be a few minutes. It took 30 minutes for a new burger (she kept coming over and saying just a few more minutes). By the time my food came out my colleagues were finished eating. They took my burger off the bill, but I still feel as if the manager should've came over and said something but he looked too busy standing behind the bar doing nothing.

I've ordered from this location numerous times and never had an issue with a delivery. I talk to the manager who agrees this unacceptable and offers to send me another pizza ""right away"". Well his definition and my definition of right away are drastically different. I called at 8:19pm and an hour later i STILL have nothing. Thankfully he canceled my order and I didn't get stuck paying for this but I'm big mad that it's been almost a 3 hour ordeal.

"My partner and I had been here about five years ago and had a great experience so we decided we would go there for a family birthday dinner tonight. Boy, has this place really tanked since then...  1. Our entrees took 1.5 HOURS to come. And while we waited, no one followed up with is on why our food was taking so long.   2. Some of the food was awful. The Fra Diablo sauce was overly sweet. Both the Caesar and House salads were underwhelming. The Shrimp Scampi had NO FLAVOR AT ALL. The sauce was basically water and the shrimp seemed microwaved. The Chicken Marsala was rubbery and the rice that came with it was overcooked.  3. Our waiter was inattentive and disrespectful!! He kept forgetting to bring things that we asked for. Another ginger ale, more napkins, etc. He never refilled our water glasses and after asking him several times for more water, he brought us a pitcher but didn't bring more glasses in case someone else wanted some. Lastly, he never actually apologized for our food taking so long!!! When he came around to ask about dessert, his excuse was that they were very busy at that hour. BUT YOU HAVE THAT MANY SEATS IN YOUR RESTAURANT! You have to be able to serve at maximum capacity and keep all of your customers satisfied. Finally, once he brought the dessert menu, HE NEVER CAME BACK. He disappeared. We had to ask another waitress to bring our check. We saw her tell him and we thought he was walking towards us, but he stopped at a table RIGHT in front of us to take their order!! Then walked away!!!!! The waitress hen brought us our check!  4. Some of our food came significantly later than the rest. We didn't order anything fancy, like lobster or french onion soup. But some of it came like ten minutes after everyone else's food. The Brussel Sprouts came super late and so did the Chicken Parm dinner.  Overall, was a waste of time and money. And the worst part is that because we were 7 people, 18% gratuity was automatically added to our check, so it felt like they didn't care to serve us well because they were already guaranteed a tip. AND after all of this and his excuses for the food being so late, we heard the waitress offer another table of 6 who was just as angry free drinks, free dessert, and even joked they could have another meal on the house!

"My roommate told me this place opened up in Lakeview which is close to where we live.  I got off of work and was looking forward to eating a good poke bowl and thought I would give this place a shot. It turned out to be my first mistake. There was literally no one when I walked in. The place looks very presentable and is very nice looking.  It was very clean and modern inside. I had high expectations. I order a custom bowl with brown rice/spring mix, with my 3 protein choices being  spicy tuna, yellow tail and crawfish.  I had it with a Lime Sriracha  sauce with all the veggies and chili sauce with the ponzu sauce mixed in. My second mistake was not eating the bowl inside.  I took it to go.  I certainly would have mentioned to them the issue I had which brings me to my next complaint. The rice on first bite looked odd, like it either was undercooked or too cooked to the point it was dried out.  I suspect they didn't add enough water for the brown rice.  It was practically inedible.  I couldn't chew it it was so hard.  Imagine chewing rice that has the consistency of a hard seed.  That was my experience.  It was terrible.  The proteins look low grade, especially the yellow fin.  I will never go back and I don't recommend anyone else does either.  If you want good poke in the Lakeview/Metairie area just make the drive to Poke Loa or to Lemon Shark.  It is worth it, trust me.

And I will be honest, the food can be good as hell whenever (or if it ever) it gets here but it won't matter at this point. To tell a customer that you're short-staffed (on a Sunday) and that your order is going to come in another 15-20 minutes (after they were waiting nearly an hour up until that point) is not good customer service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"The first time we bought a pizza from this restaurant we chose all veggie toppings. The veggies were raw and were sliding off the pizza bread. We didn't like that. To make a good pizza you need to blend the ingredients together, not slam them left and right at the very end.  Yesterday we gave these guys another chance. I ordered a calzone with meatballs and my wife got some hot wings. The chicken wings were baked with sauce added later. That wasn't ideal, but wasn't the bigger problem either. My calzone was disgusting: the crust was soggy, the cheese was really cheap and low-quality, and the meat was old: a greasy disaster. I ate some of it because I was hungry, but my stomach complained for hours afterwards. Never again will I touch their food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Hopefully it was an off day. This is our second visit to 2 Chicks during our trip. The first was awesome. But the second, well. The service fell short. Food, flat. Sweet potato pancakes flavorless as packing peanuts and mushy. I understand they're grain free, but they were nearly inedible today. Maybe they're usually better. I hope so.   And our server seemed inconvenienced. The entire experience was disappointing. Her attitude, unfortunately, set the tone for the experience. I did love the initial visit and enjoyed their sweet potato home fries. Having the option for duck eggs is a tasty surprise.   Two Chicks is one of two breakfast joints we ate at during the trip. They've got all the elements of things I adore in a breakfast place. But today, it's a no go.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I am a native Korean from Manhattan. I wanted to try this place while visiting Tucson. Their side dishes were so so but Kimbab, one of the appetizers, was not bad. But I completely lost my appetite when  I found a hair in the main dish, Bibimbap.  Yikes, hair in the food? They apologized & replaced with another dish but by then, I was ready  to leave. I would not recommend this place at all.  Go to Kimchi Time , where you can find genuinely delicious Korean food( please check out my review on Yelp) if you are  a great fan of authentic Korean dishes. Unfortunately, this place won't last long unless they overhaul the menu choice which seems to be tailored to the general public who are not familiar with the Korean cuisine.  Their horrendous decor was beyond one's imagination.  Speaking of their parking lot, oh boy, the space  was full of potholes & the back alley was unpaved & bumpy.

"I dont know what happened. This used to be my favourite take out spot. We just ordered food that tasted terrible, some of the worst food I have ever gotten from a restaurant.   The fried rice, which used to be the best in the city, had no vegetables in it. It was a soggy, oily mush of rice.  I ordered moo goo gai pan like I usually do. and the sauce tasted genuinely rancid. I do not like wasting food but it was truly inedible and I am concerned about it being spoiled or something.  My husband ordered pork which was previously his favourite. It was tough, chewy and dry.   The only thing that tasted somewhat normal was their jumbo egg rolls which still seemed more bland than usual.   I am extremely upset about the waste of money and food.

"I always try to find the good in every experience, so this pains me to write about my first and last visit to Royal Thai...  We made reservations for a party of 8 on a Friday night at 7pm. The restaurant was busy, but definitely not slammed. Our entire experience took over 2 hrs! There was only 1 server for the entire place! We waited, and waited, and waited before our drink orders where even taken. Then we waited some more to actually get the drinks. Finally we placed our food orders, and couldn't wait to eat our yummy meals. We had heard mixed reviews about Royal Thai, but we know they were voted ""Best Thai"" by the Nashville Scene. The service may have been slow, but we were fully expecting the food to make up for it. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! 5 out of our 8 (including me) ordered the Pad Thai and we were all agreed that it was the WORST Pad Thai ever. It basically was a heaping pile of brown mush...not to mention I had ordered mine medium-hot and there wasn't even an ounce of spice in it! The price was way too high as well.

Not only was it cold but it was super dry and extremely chewy, it felt like I was eating elastic. I called back and told the person on the phone about the pizza being cold and it shouldn't have been cold considering the time frames. She offered to give me a free pizza the next time I ordered from there. Unfortunately the pizza was so bad I don't even want it for free. And to top it all off, all night I had the worst stomachache from that pizza and it's rare for me to get severe stomach pains like I did, I only experience it when the food is not fresh.

"This is the one french byob my fiancé and I have been wanting to try for several months after reading the stellar reviews. We came hungry and ready to have an awesome meal...and left hungry and disappointed. First off, the ambience lacked the character we have grown accustomed to in the Philly byob scene. Just a small bland room with about 10 tables. For appetizer, we ordered the consommé made out of mushroom and carrot ravioli. It was very bland and plain. The waiter told us the chef recommends the mussels in white wine sauce with purple potatoes so I ordered them and my fiancé ordered the grouper with couscous. Both were one of the worst entrees we have had. The mussels were incredibly bland and tasteless and worse than any mussels I have ever ordered in any pub. My fiancé describes the grouper as way too fishy, undercooked, and one of the worst fish dishes she has ever tried at any restaurant. Finally, we're hoping the restaurant would redeem itself with the dessert. Nope. The Floating Island was a zephyr in some creamy sweet sauce that was too sweet and nothing special. We also ordered the apple tart with honey ice cream. It was the best part of our meal all night. Overall, you know it's a bad meal when you are finishing the meal the same way you started - with bread and butter. Really don't understand all the hype as the food and ambience were poor.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Wish I could do no stars and that is such a disappointment since I'm a longtime fan and patron of the Margarita's in lansdale. This one was just an all around awful experience.   Came on a Wednesday around 6:45 and it was not crowded so we were seated right away in the bar area. However, took more than 20 min for a waiter to come over. He told us his section was on the other side of the bar and wasn't told he was seated. It was now 7:02 which meant we could no longer before 7 to get the deal on margaritas. When I mentioned this the waiter said ""I'm so sorry guys. I'll make it up to you. I'll bring you some chips. "" I'm not an idiot - chips are free for all tables! Then took 10 min to bring our drinks overs and take our orders. Got the shrimp quesadilla appetizer which was the only redeeming factor of this meal. Great big juicy shrimp and corn with peppers and onions. It was delicious. The guacamole with it however was bland and completely flavorless. It was also quite brown from sitting out too long. Then came the entrees - short rib tacos and the taco trio. Both of our entrees were room temperature at best. The short rib was flavorful but dry and the white sauce on it was awful and a weird texture. The taco trio was nothing special - the chicken was dry, bland, and cold, the carnitas was the best one but also room temp.

"Terrible greeter and management combo!  Management personnel seemed indifferent about how the greeter messed up the order of who needed to be seated first and the fact that the greeter never verbally apologized (saying he was busy). This clearly is a management issue since allocation of job responsibilities for the greeter led to the situation. At first, I felt just being mistreated by the greeter and his rude response but, the more and more I think, this is a mismanagement situation. If I were IHOP's HQ, I would reassess the manager's evaluation for the year. I would take off points for her incompetence in the area of resource management and, in addition, submit the greeter to have sensitivity and public relations education and training.  In regard to the server, she was great!  The food was also moderately prepared as well.  Overall, the manager's and the greeter's combined incompetence, I am giving this location a one star.

There is one individual in particular that has no business in customer service. I watched Jamie (an employee) bite her fingernails at the bar and then serve beverages and food to customers. I observed her berate fellow employees with verbal aggressive behavior and general bad attitude and bark ""just do what I say and we won't have a problem."" When this employee went to three separate members of management she was brushed aside and ultimately reprimanded. I noticed there is no ""employees must wash hands before returning to work"" sign, which clearly wasn't implemented in this case. Jamie asked a couple ""will you still eat this?""

"Please do not order from this location.    I placed an order on Saturday evening at 4:46 pm.     I received a text from the restaurant stating that my order was out for delivery at 6:00 pm.     I called the restaurant at 6:30 pm to check on my delivery (mind you - I am 7 minutes from the restaurant).   I was told to call back in a few minutes.

"Writing this review makes me sad, as we had our wedding reception at the SYR and have had countless meals at this restaurant.  Tonight was by far the worst meal we've ever had while dining at the Ranch.  The service was truly appalling.  As my husband put it, you would get better service at an Applebee's than what we received this evening at Stonehouse.  There were 4 tonight of patrons dining when we arrived, each table had their own waiter or waitress.  Considering the lack of people dining, we wondered why we kept having to look around for our waitress, to order food, to get more water, etc.  The food was brought out, appetizers first followed by the mains.  When the mains were delivered, we had no clean plates or silverware, just the dirty appetizer plates still on the table.  We finally found the gentleman who would come around and fill up the water, and so, we asked him for plates.  He said he would get the waitress, and 10 minutes later, no waitress and no plates...(I almost had to get up to find our server)!  By the time the waitress did arrive back at our table, empty handed, we then had to ask her for plates.  She finally came back after our request, with the plates, and by then the food was absolutely cold and inedible.  We made a comment about the food now being too cold to eat, and to be honest, she didn't seem to really care.  This is not what one would expect when dining at Stonehouse. Considering how we have so many fond memories and have celebrated so many special occasions at the SY Ranch, we were truly puzzled by what was going on.    To completely top off the evening, my husband had called ahead yesterday to inform the restaurant that it was my birthday dinner, and that he would like to request a candle in my dessert that I would order.  He was told yesterday that they were too busy and would have to call him back; well, they never did.  So today he called and let the hostess know this information while I was at the hair salon.  After our dinner plates were cleared, we waiting for about 20 minutes and finally the waitress appeared with 2 measly caramel cookies and a birthday candle, she placed the plate down and said happy birthday (I swear you couldn't even hear what she said) and walked away.  We were really puzzled as to why no one brought us a dessert menu.  By the time we could even get someone to come back to the table with a dessert menu (we were wanting actual dessert, NOT cookies), another 10 minutes had gone by, and at that point we were really just ready to get out of there and head back to the Biltmore.

To have spent $30 each person, I expected the food to be delicious. The mashed potatoes were horrendous. The desserts were good.

"Paramour has gone downhill since I was last here about a year ago.  This time around i would give them three or four stars for the food, zero stars for everything else.   The food was good from salad to dessert.  Fresh tasting, well prepared, nice presentation.  The four of us had a variety of items - salads, soup, meat and fish.  A good job with the food across the board.  However, the rest of the equation left much to be desired.  The tables are small - too small for 4 people.  They are generic plastic/wood covered tables which is fine - but cover them with a table cloth, place-mats, something.  Today there were just plates and flatware placed down on the bare plastic. Not very appetizing or appealing!  In addition. the service was very poor as well.  The waitress acted as if she was doing us a favor by taking our orders.  Questions were answered with an attitude as if we were morons. We were rushed thru the various courses with the check being presented while we were in the midst of eating dessert.  If I was eating in a deli, I would not have minded - but this restaurant is trying to be something other than Hymie's - and failed, badly.  While the food is certainly up to snuff, the overall experience is not.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Been coming here for years, I ordered a burrito ranchero today as I have for years, I asked for extra guacamole and jalepenos as I always do but this time they charged me $.75 for the two which I didn't terribly mind and had it as take out. I get home and have 0 guacamole and only 3 jalapeños in the whole burrito. I called to point out the mistake and they said they would put it in my burrito next time for free. Yet I explained I already paid for them and it's always been free in the past so that didn't address the issue. I had already explained I'm a half hour away, 1 way and the manager came on the phone and had me reexplain the whole situation then said he could only make the toppings free next time and refused to do a free burrito or ANYTHING else. Then he said I could drive back and he would take care of it to which I asked if he was being smart since it was 50 minute round trip minimum. He refused to do anything else to make up for charging me extra and giving me no guac which 1 scoop is typically complementary. I have been coming here for almost 10 years and will never come back because of $0.75/for toppings $13/ a burrito is worth more than a loyal customer.  I would not recommend coming here, as a long term customer I feel totally screwed over",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I write this review from Kennett Brewing Company after waiting 1 hr 15 mins at Grain without ever being served our meal. We ultimately had to come up with backup Mother's Day brunch plans. I do regret not taking the other Yelp reviews more seriously and I should have known things were not going to go well when the waitress's greeting was ""So I guess no one has come to wait on you yet.""  The Grain Bloody Mary was good. Unfortunately the olive was not blue cheese stuffed as mentioned on the menu but I can deal. Good beer list too. I feel bad for the server having to cover for the slow kitchen, but she never mentioned anything to us about a delay or with apologies or anything so my sympathy only goes so far. We did, however, hear her extending apologies to other diners complaining about the wait. I overheard the waitress mention the kitchen was ""slammed"" yet, there were a number of empty tables in the restaurant and only 2 ppl at the bar.   We weren't the only table to have gotten up to leave after 1 hour plus with no food. I can even understand it if we have complex orders...but we ordered a breakfast burrito, omelette and pancakes. Lesson learned.  These aren't just growing pains from a restaurant that just hit their 1 year anniversary. There's a more systemic problem here.

He asked us at least 6 times if we were SURE we wanted it. And do we understand that if it's open we can't return it. This is all after it took 30 minutes to get waters! Came back again tonight for a second chance, the hostess said it was a 45 minute wait. My mom asked ""why so many empty tables?""

"THIEVES. And just like that they lost a customer. Last time I patronized this establishment which is a literal 45 minute drive away from (but I continued to patronize, because loyalty), there was an issue with my order that led to them giving me less than what I was charged for. I was told by the gentleman at the register that all I had to was come back , provide my name and number, and they would compensate their error with my next order. This seems a bit funny but I was ASSURED that as long as I leave my phone number, I would be compensated with the missing portion of my previous order. I called today to place said order and was hurriedly told that because the gentleman who told me this is not in today, they cannot honor what he told me. Apparently he's sick and won't be back for another 2 weeks, so I have to drive all the  way home and make another hour long trip just for them to fix THEIR error for overcharging me. I am VERY shocked. I guess this is how they reward loyal customers. Good bye forever, Krispy Krab Largo. You can keep the money that you OVERCHARGED me for and are refusing to rectify.

I get a missed call from them so I return the call and the cook says she cooked the burgers and she's standing by her burgers (in defense mode)!  Miss I can care less about you or your burgers if you can't take criticism you shouldn't be a cook! It's not my fault that I paid for food I wanted cooked a certain way, and was highly disappointed.

"Until now, I've never reviewed anything, but my recent experience at Opa compels me to write this.  As for the service my family and I received:  Extremely slow, even though it was a Tuesday night and many tables were empty.  One member of our party was not served her entree until everybody else had nearly finished theirs.  As for the food:  Opinions ranged from ""okay"" to ""good.""    My main complaint:  At the end of the meal, when the server delivered the credit-card slip to me for my signature, the bill's total was labeled--in large capitalized letters--as ""PRE-TIP AMT.""  I know that some restaurants include a tip in the bill for large parties such as ours, but a total labeled ""PRE-TIP AMT,"" along with a blank line directly beneath it labeled ""TIP,"" is a solid indication that Opa is not one of those restaurants.  I added a $28.00 tip.  The next day, when I looked at the itemized billing, I discovered Opa had included an 18% tip of $23.85 in the ""PRE-TIP AMT.""

"We ordered from this restaurant Fri night  It was by far the worst experience I have ever had with a restaurant. I recieved the order confirmation stating my order would be delivered in approximately 75 minutes at 7:45pm. That would make the delivery around 9pm. We didn't end up recieving our order until 10:10pm. When I called at 9:33pm I was offered no appology, but was told that our delivery was on the way and the driver should arrive in just a few minutes. After calling again at 10pm I again got no appology or even explaination, just a we're busy and an annoyed tone. When we finally recieved the pizza at 10:10pm it was very cold. We tried to eat a slice anyway because we were starving and it was terrible. We had ordered a meatball pizza and another pizza with sausage. The meat was very low quality and tasted like what I imagine my dogs treats would taste like. We had to throw it all away. On top of that when we requested a refund from the restaurant they refused. The only positive thing that came from this whole experience is the customer service we recieved from the app we used for the order, Slice. They quickly responded to our complaint and refunded our payment directly, since the restaurant refused. I highly recommend using the Slice app!

I was really disappointed with this place. I asked for a tomato pie and an additional topping of some provolone cheese but was refused because their strict policy is to only use vegetarian cheese on this type of pizza.  The slices we settled on instead of a freshly made pizza were nothing out of the ordinary because they had been sitting for a while and were also very disappointing. The regular cheese pizza my friend ordered was oozing red grease out of the slice. My slice of kale pizza was also very dry. The only redeeming thing was the crust had a nice consistency.  The extraordinary thing was that a slice of pizza and a soda is $7.50 I can't see how they will survive in this neighborhood which has a lot of lower income people who won't get this higher price concept. There are many good quality Artisanal pizza places in the city that are much less expensive with much better quality.  I drove all the way over there from South Philly and it will definitely be the last time that I drive to either of these  establishments.

"I really wanted to like this place. It really does have a TON of potential and I have heard good things about some of the other locations. But after two awful visits, it's safe to say I will not be returning.  Let's start with the good.  Very cool décor.  There's graffiti art around the restaurant. A very cool vibe and I really like how the windows open in the front giving it that ""outdoor-indoor feel.""   The margaritas are also very tasty. We got a flight and the pear one was delicious! The prices too are also very reasonable.  The Bad: Not a fan of the food. The first time I went was before they even opened for a sneak peak.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt since I knew they were still troubleshooting some issues and still working out all the kinks.   Keep in mind, I'm a vegetarian and ordered George's Dirty Taco and the Mantis. I don't do well with spice but could barely eat the Dirty Taco because of the sauce. As for the Mantis, it wasn't much better- it had little to no flavor.  The Service:  The first time around as I mentioned, I gave them a pass. It was the first night, servers were still training, and it was a full house.  This recent time though, it was just rough from start to finish.  It took our waitress SO long just to get our drinks, they messed up one of our orders, and then she spoke down to me in front of everyone telling me I filled out the ""scranton"" menu wrong and needed to redo it so the cooks could see what I wanted.   When I did... she never returned,  so that everyone got their food and I was stuck waiting for mine. Once again, when my food finally did come, it was disappointing to say the least.

I'm not sure if the waitress and barmaid were a bit prejudice or not a fan of the military. Either way I've never been asked to move from a table we've chosen in my life until we visited Joey's. I recommended this place after seeing them featured on The Food Network and I'm sorry they got our business. A group of us (four to be specific) returning from a Color/Honor Guard ceremony in our Dress Blues entered, we requested to sit at a six-top (we had our covers, jackets, gear, etc and could have used the two extra seats to place our items so they wouldn't get dirty on the table) and we were denied. I understand if the place was busy and needed to keep that open for a larger party, but they weren't. It was a slow week day. We were then seated at a small four-top. Shortly after we sat two gentlemen came in, sat at the same 6-top we had requested (there were 2 & 4-tops still available) and nothing was said to them. I noticed it, my coworkers also shared a sideways look. These men weren't apart of a larger party, it was only them. I was baffled by this. We have not returned.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Was here about 3 months ago for the 2 roll sushi special.  The rolls were well made, balanced, large, full, substantial and delicious, not a speck of rice out of place.     TODAY, came back for the same 2 roll sushi special.  The rolls were microscopic, unbalanced, very poorly made.  They were significantly less than HALF the size of the rolls I ordered 3 months ago.  I could of (should of) gone to the grocery store across the street and gotten a much more substantial, better made set of rolls for the same price.    This was supposed to be lunch and only served as an overpriced, poorly made, micro snack.  I'll have to leave work and get something else.

"Went to get a large deluxe pizza( $28 +plus dollars just for pizza!) on a Saturday night Around 7 pm, placed order and paid for it then went next door to Publix to grocery shop. By the time I finished shopping ( over hour and half) I drove home completely forgetting I had ordered the pizza! By the time I put all my groceries away, I tried to call this pizza shop and they were closed at 9:00 on a Saturday night! So I waited till the next day and THEY WERE CLOSED ON SUNDAY ALSO...! So when Monday rolls around I call and talk to the manager/ owner who could have cared less! He got his money, he says I will give you 50% off another pizza today. I said I've already paid you for an entire pizza and he says too bad you didn't come pick it up! Wow, I could not believe my ears! He was arguing with me about giving me another pizza!

"Went in with my husband for lunch, it was not very busy. This is our first and last time going there. We came out of our way to go and try it. When you walk in you wait for someone to talk to you, they hand you a menu and tell you to stand at the counter and when you decide what you want let them know and  pay for your food first and then go find a seat. The table was filthy and we were told that they would clean it, the first girl brought out our drinks and places them on the dirty table and leaves. Next we order the duo guacamole and another girl brings it out and she  puts it on the dirty table, I told her the table is filthy, so I move it and she goes and gets some spray and a rag and is spraying right on me and near the food and just throws the dirty food on the floor. The guacamole was terrible, it has no taste and they give you a ton of chips and not much guacamole for the money. My husband ordered 2 tacos and I ordered 2 tacos,the girl asked if we want them on the same plate, I said no, they dont even give you plates the food comes out on boards The tacos were loaded with cabbage and not much meat.  I had to ask for salt and it was like I was asking for gold.The overall service was terrible and no one acknowledges you the whole time you are there. you have to chase after them if you want something. We never got a refill on our drinks since no one comes around. We spent a lot of money for chips, because there definitely was not much meat in the tacos and not much guacamole.

"I moved to La Vergne in January and was happy to come across a soul food restaurant while out and about 2 weeks ago. My friend stopped by M & V earlier in the day last Wednesday, since there were no to go menus he took a picture and wanted to return later for us both to try. Once we arrived that evening, the place was empty and the music was blaring...well, that wouldn't be a big deal if the owner wasn't speaking barely above a whisper. It was an immediate awkward situation, she didn't give us any eye contact anyone was very short. I knew this could not have been the way she was earlier for him to want to return! The meatloaf was horribly seasoned, it tasted like it had a lot of oregano, that's all you could taste. The greens were good and the fish had a nice spice to it. The rib tips were decent. I'm not sure what's with the inconsistent customer service but the food is not with dealing with the attitude. I'd rather make the drive to East Nashville.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I'll start this by saying that I am a really forgiving customer. I've worked in the service industry, so I know what jerks people can be. I understand when wait staff are overly busy and shorthanded. This was not the case here. It was slow, the restaurant was barely 1/4 full. That being said, our server came to our table exactly three times. Once to drop off our menus, once to take our order and once to collect payment. Someone else dropped off our food. He never once stopped back in to see how our food was or refill drinks. I wanted to order some toast and couldn't find him to do that. Then we find out that there is a buffet. He never told us that. We were not familiar with this restaurant so we had no idea. I ended up going up to the buffet and getting my own order of toast because our waiter was literally disappeared. This had to be some of the worst service we've ever had in such a nice place. The food I ordered was not to my liking (biscuits and gravy) but to be fair, I just didn't like it. It doesn't mean it was terrible. My husband had the crab benedict and he said it was just fine. So overall, not a stellar experience for sure.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

I mentioned this to the wait staff person and she went into denial mode, claiming that it always is that way, it's normal, etc. I wasn't asking for anything, just letting her know, but she clearly didn't want to hear it.

"This was our 3rd time visiting this location on Saturday after a day at the lake.   1st time, shame on you. 2nd time, shame on me. 3rd time, you're outta here.   You provided me with such a subpar example of Louisiana fast food, it makes my poor, southern heart tell you, ""Bless Your Heart"", at least you tried.   Issues with the 3 visits:  Order #1 - 4 months ago: Mixed reg/spicy dark only family meal was all regular, and mostly chicken wings and 2 breast. It was chicken and the side were ok... not a deal breaker... unsweet tea that was suppose to be sweet... shame on you.   Order #2 - all chicken right. Sweet tea was not sweet, though an attempt at it was seriously sad.   Order #3 (nail in the coffin) - order was completely wrong. Kids leg was a sad, sad, sad chicken strip that looked like a leftover from someone's lunch. It was enough for my 4 year old to say, looks yuck... well, it's bad when a 4 year old can see the chicken wasn't thoroughly cooked. Still looked pretty whitish on the outer layer of breading. Spicy chicken sandwich was not spicy, nor all the hype they are in Texas. It was a pathetic attempt at something not the competitors sandwich.  Sweet tea - oh where do I start?? It tasted like someone filled the tea maker with city water, then left it in the maker for a day, then put it in a dirty dispenser that hasn't been cleaned in a year. Then don't add the sugar. That's what their tea tastes like.  It is the most awful attempt at fried anything I've ever seen....    This is me saying.... ""Good day sir! I say good day!""

I can't describe how disappointed I am. I'm actually embarrassed I paid for it and really tried eating them without saying another word. The wings were deep fried and then sprinkled with Parmesan powder (the type you buy off the shelf for your pasta) on top and the ""blackened"" were the exact same wings sprinkled with what I'm 100% sure was supposed to be the dry rub/seasoning. They were also over cooked so they were on the dry side. My partner and I really tried to eat them because it was late, we had already made the trip, and we were starving. My gin and soda was also very watery. However, 1 star for the potato skins. My partner disagrees but I thought they were pretty good.

"Terrible customer service/awareness. So I have been going to Lilly's for years, long before the Goleta location opened. I used to stand in line outside the Chapala store and watch the freeway cars whiz by. Today that all changes. I order 3 tacos and start to wait. I then remembered that I wanted peppers and onions. I very politely wait until the cashier moves to the next person and quickly ask. She says sure. Then while I'm moving back to where I was waiting, she informs me it's a dollar. I decided to get in the back of the line and wait my turn. When I get there I noticed I spent the cash I had on my first order, so I grab my debit card. I'm then informed there will be a 50¢ charge for purchases less than $5. It's not worth it at this point. I then go to pick up my tacos and they try to hand me the extras but I decline because I didn't pay and the looked at me like I'm the biggest problem ever. I just don't understand it when people in service jobs refuse to give good service. I looked very disappointed and I feel they couldn't care less.

"RUDE AF- I've been following The Gallery on Instagram for quite a while because their desserts always look interesting. They often times have really unique offerings. So when I saw that they posted this today, I questioned if they were hopping onto the dessert ramen trend. I've seen a lot of places using ramen as a base with coconut milk or coconut pudding and various other additions. However when I asked about it, I was insulted, and felt disrespected. Instead of answering my question, they threw negativity my way. They ended up deleting my (ooops typo'd desserts) comments and blocking me.

She then told me ""We do things how we do things around here"" followed by another ""Hold on"", in which she began to answer other phones and I assume take other orders leaving me on hold to wait for my food purchase. This right here is abusive behaviors from a eatery. I held on for about 2-5 minutes and told the young lady to have a good evening and that I would be placing my order else where at another location.

"One of my favorite spots was closed for Memorial Day. So I went to another place called El Pollo Tapatio. The food is very bland and pricy for what they offer. I ordered taco Asada and rice. Which I feel was overpriced for the taste. Not even mediocre but way below that. I was lied to by the lady who took my order. I checked my to go order and didn't see any salsa for my tacos. So I asked for salsa verse for my tacos. The lady told me it was in the bag.  After getting home. Not only was there no salsa verse to be found. No limes. I decided to call the place. Spoke with the lady who took my order. I told her about not having any lime or salsa, she told me on the phone they were out. I asked her why didn't she say that instead of lie about it? Anyways..the place is awful for Mexican food period unless you like bland thrown together food. I've lived all over and this place is proof that not every Mexican family should open up a Mexican restaurant. I had some better food on a food truck. Customers be aware.

Our drinks didn't come out until after our food, and even then it was only when I flagged someone down and had to ask them to follow up. I ordered a salad with no olives, and it came out full of olives. They prepared a new one quickly, but then the lettuce seemed old and wilted.

"I really, really wanted to like Oyster Shucker. Out of town on vacation. All you can eat crab legs in an ocean front town. What could go wrong? Well first of all, the crab legs were the same crab legs I can get in Kansas City at the casino buffet. Maybe it was wrong of me to expect more out of crab legs next to the ocean than in the Midwest where I'm from? Secondly, a choice of side dish came with the crab legs. I should have gone with fries like my wife did, but instead I chose the loaded mashed potatoes. In Kansas City, when you order loaded mashed potatoes, you get half a plate full of them. At Oyster Shucker it was a bowl the size my wife and I used to feed our children when they were babies. Add to that the fact that it had just rained and in order to sit outside to enjoy the ocean view while we ate, we had to deal with gnats flying around our crab legs. It rains pretty much every day, so you'd think they would have tackled this issue before.

I moved to the Franklin area a few months ago and have visited this location several times and leave disappointed in the food almost every time. Today just left me shocked. I placed a to go order for the Chicken Pecan Salad and 6 piece chicken tenders. The salad I asked if I could make it vegetarian by substituting the chicken for strawberries, the nice guy at the bar said absolutely. Then I got home and my salad included 1 sliced strawberry. I knew that I would be paying the same price for the salad even though I didn't want the chicken, however I figured I would get a good portion of strawberries since the cost of a chicken breast is significantly more than a hand full of strawberries. In addition, the honey croissant that comes with the salad did not have the honey. The 6 piece chicken tenders, 3 were really small, more like chicken nuggets. The quality of food and portions given at this location do not compare to other Cheddars locations I've been to and because it's in Franklin the menu prices are even higher.  UPDATE: I sent a private message with my contact info per Cheddars' request and no one contacted me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Institutional food at its best. The place smelled like old fryer grease and just gave off a negative vibe. Maybe that was because two meals were sent back while we were waiting for our food.

"i am seriously concerned about the taste buds of the people of the people who gave this place a raving review.   (Service) Me and a girlfriend stopped here for lunch one day  but should have turned around the moment the (older and should be experienced) hostess told us to hold on a minute as she continued a conversation with her friends, mind you she was sitting down when we walked in and didn't acknowledge us for a few minutes, nor could we tell that she was employed there. After completing her conversation she basically told us we could sit anywhere we'd like, so she had us waiting for no reason.  she than disappeared as other people waited in confusion. While our server was friendly he wasn't very attentive, even though the room mostly empty. may have had one refill.  (price) The ratio between quality and amount of food is not worth the price.  (Food) AVERAGE! i was born and raised in New Orleans and this food just didn't live up to the hype.

"After not having had a real, fresh, White Castle hamburger for nearly 20 years, I was super excited to be in Nashville for a conference.  I walked over, from my hotel, to grab some late evening hamburgers.   In the old days, you knew that the grills were only cleaned 2 times a day, so the later in the day you went, the more oniony/greasy the burgers were gonna be.  Bring it on!  I got in and ordered 6 burgers.   I opted for some onion rings.  The manager told me that he was going to make fresh onion rings for me.   I noticed the soda fountain was out of most of the flavors.    I got my sandwiches and rings and walked back to the hotel, in the rain.  I got to my hotel room and tore into the first burger.  Dry.   What the heck?   How could this be dry?   Where is the grease?  Where is the onion perfume?  Even the bread was dry.    I hoped it was only this one burger.  Sadly, the rest were also super dry.     The onion rings were hot and crispy, but I can get those anywhere.  Major letdown.  I had even thought about another visit before I flew home, but since these burgers were so terrible, I decided to not waste my money.     So sad.

We went on a Sunday night for my birthday dinner. We ordered 2 appetizers (the tempura and mixed fish sashimi). The sashimi was not fresh tasting which should have been sign #1. The tempura was good. For our entrees we ordered the Bolgogi and the crispy chicken. While eating my second bite of chicken is when my husband called attention to the mouse that had come from the direction of the kitchen and was headed towards the front of the restaurant. Let's just say I was done eating and we left right after. After I looked at this restaurants Yelp health score of 65 out of 100 I was not surprised. Noted - we will never be eating here again.

"Honestly, where do I begin....The appeal of this place is dollar taco night... If you must go here, go on a regular night.  Dollar Taco night is a good deal but at what cost? The bartenders making you feel like a drink order is like asking them to pick you up from an airport 6 hours away during rush hour traffic? Not being able to add a sprinkle of shredded cheese to a taco without an up charge? The veggie options are so boring and they'll charge, like I said, to add anything to them, so don't even ask.  We waited for an hour, ordered a couple tacos, but they somehow only managed to bring out our side of guacamole? I feel bad for the handful of servers who are friendly.   If you're in the mood for cheap imitation Mexican food that makes you feel fat and greasy, there is a Chipotle a mile away and they are way nicer there.  The food at Loco Pez is decent if you want to indulge, but not worth bad service and being made to feel like an inconvenience.   Also, take credit cards....are you really trying that hard to not pay taxes?

"We have been to this Outback many times.  We have noticed prices rising and quality and serving sizes going down.  Tonight we splurged on fillet and lobster.  I ordered as always med rare.  The meal arrived with a very small potato and a very small fillet.  When I cut into it it appeared raw in the center.  I tried one bite and could not eat it.  When the waiter returned I showed him my steak and he said, ""oh no, I will take it back and we will cook it a ""couple more minutes"".  The acting, assistant whatever manager brought back my steak, the small pieces I had already cut were charred and overdone.  The other half was very charred on the outside and still raw in the center.  All the while the manager person was beaming as if they had created a marvel.  My regret was not taking a picture of this mess.  I could not understand how a manager could serve this.  When I expressed my displeasure he pops out a card for a free appetizer for next time as if that will make up for a $26 mess.  I indicated I could not eat that and there was a half hearted offer to take it back again.  I declined since this steak was already inedible.  Needless to say we will not be back again.  Although the waiter was very nice, I think he should have gone back to the pseudo manager and said, ""she cannot eat that steak"".  Did not happen.  I happen to have a lot of family stuff going on and this was the very last thing I needed tonight.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
Watery flavorless marinara and over cooked pasta.  I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and that is what I got.  The meatballs themselves were good and tender but even they were bland and washed out by the watery marinara sauce. The only thing saving the flavor was the parmesan cheese sprinkled on the dish. Sad because the location is good and the decor is nice but that can't save bad food. I mean if you can't do something as basic as a marinara sauce and cook pasta correctly I will not bother coming back to see if the pizza is up to the hype.

Edit: After some googling I have discovered that the business is apparently closed at 20:30, Yelp has incorrectly lead some people on with a false closing time. Still, to arrive prior to closing and be treated with such a dismissive attitude is unacceptable in my mind. The guy fact checked me with his iPhone right in front of me and even acknowledged I was correct about the 21:00 closing time.

"$6 beers in Fishtown...is that an oxymoron? Also the way you obtain your food is slow and inefficient as we waited an hour for simple bar food, and had to keep checking at the bar to see if it was ready. But, I'm optimistic that they'll change this, and at that point I'll edit my review.  Overall, it seems to be missing that authentic Philly character/influence; the scene they're trying to create almost seems forced and not genuine, but that's just my perception. It just feels more Brooklyn than Philly. Other than that, cool looking space and fun vintage arcade games.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Went to Louisiana Purchase on an early Sunday evening for dinner. Never noticed this place until I went to it but it's right by Marquee. Interesting.    Anyways, the place is pretty bright and snazzy. I like how they have a little ""patio"" area in the front if you want to sit outside. Too bad you can't sit in the sun as the building pretty much blocks out the sun. We decided to sit inside and the waitress we had was nice but seemed a bit overzealous.  As for the food, we ordered:  - Alligator kebab ($11) - warning, you only get one skewer to share (which our waitress warned us about) but it was tasty.  Came with a nice black-bean and mango salsa underneath it.  Was good but definitely overpriced. - Pasta larocca ($22) - Linguine pasta in a ginger cream sauce with Italian sausage and scallops.  Had a taste of my friend's dish and scallops were really good. - Seafood boudin ($23) - spiced seafood and rice served in a peppercorn cream sauce. - Blackened blues catfish ($22) - Cajun spiced catfish with a creole tomato sauce. I had this one and catfish was perfectly cooked. Also, first time I've had catfish served this one (usually it's deep fried) and I have to say, I like LP's take on it.  You choose your sides (I had roasted potatoes and vegetables).  Food was good and we all enjoyed our meals thoroughly. While a bit pricey for cajun, I guess it is Edmonton and there are limited options if your craving this type of food. Definitely worth checking out if you want something a little fancier that hits your taste buds in all the right places.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Historically one of our favorites even though it's 40 mins from our home. However this evening has changed our entire Macaroni opinion. Haven't eaten at this location for quite awhile but Should've known something was wrong when the restaurant was only half full at 7:00 on a Saturday!!!! Service was poor, could easily hear the kitchen staff being obnoxious and inappropriately loud but the food was our main complaint and just plain awful. Every plate ordered at our table (five top) was over salted. I'm talking like could feel my blood pressure rise with eat bite overly salted. My penne rustica (my usual) was cold, not baked and mostly sauce. Not very rustic... In fact everything tastes pre/cooked but barely reheated which was not the original Macaroni way. We had to flag down our server (also the bar tender) for everything! Ironically the table next to us (10 feet away as the place was dead) was complaining and we could over hear the hostess taking a complaint call as we were leaving.   Very dissatisfied and doubtful this place will return to our once beloved Italian restaurant. We won't return to this location and recommend you save your money and go somewhere else.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Came to Jazz brunch on our last day in NOLA with high expectations. For about $35 before tax and tips, we had high hopes due to some of the nice reviews. Unless you want blah looking cafeteria food, do not waste your time and money here.  The food was tasteless and after one plate I was pretty much done.  Only coffee/tea was included in the brunch, anything else like juice you have to pay extra.  There was a sign that you can have an option to order omelette and eggs benedict through your sever, but we didn't bother with it since the food was so blah.  The outdoor area was cute, but they sat our group of 4 at the isle under a falling branch trees.  Little leaves and bugs would fall into our drinks.  The jazz band would take a 15 mins break after every 2 songs and they didn't seem happy to be there either.  Our waitress was okay, but she kinda pushed us to give her a 5 star survey review even though she didn't go above and beyond with her service.

Over cooked meat is a crime for a burger joint. Not that they asked how we wanted it cooked. Nothing blew my mind especially for how long it took. Wiki wiki burger had a unique flavor and I liked the pineapple addition. Grindhouse was just okay. Didn't seem special. Meats were different but not particularly flavorful. Onion rings were really good! Sweet potato fries were decent. We went and ordered take out. 15-20 minutes turned into a lil over a half hour for two burgers. Shorted staffed on a Saturday?  Friendly staff. I  will be back for beers after they get their liquor license. Maybe will give the food another try.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Food ok but frankly not worth the price. Lots of variety but some hot food wasnt hot and I could has gotten a much higher caliber meal for $29.

"food is good, nothing special, but tastes good. no reservations (which I liked) walk-ins only. but that's pretty much all good things i could say about this restaurant. about an hour after me and my wife left I received a notification from my bank that I was charged $811 for my dinner. I was surprised, how 2 people can possibly eat for $800, but I wasn't worried, guessing they probably used my credit card for another table. I called the restaurant and left a message hoping for a quick response. oh boy, I was wrong. nobody bothered to call me back, so I had to call them again. spoke with Eddie, who happened to be a manager, and was promised to fix the issue within 30 min. after an hour of waiting, we decided to go to the restaurant. upon arrival, we were told that Eddie was well aware of the situation, and was taking care of it right at that moment. we waited for another 30 min and decided to leave. 30 more minutes and I finally received a call back from Eddie, he was saying that there was nothing they could do and I should speak to my bank and dispute the above mentioned 800 bucks! I asked if they were going to do something to apologize for the inconvenience, like having that meal on the house. Eddie did not seem to like that idea and since he was as he said ""just a restaurant manager"" there was nothing he could do. in the end I was told that somebody from their financial department would call me back within 30 min. should I mention that never happened? that is the worst customer service we ve ever experienced. will we go back there?

"Didn't have a chance to even try the food. I've been here for a few months and we finally decided to try this location. It was fairly slow for a Saturday night with probably less than 8 tables occupied. We were seated right away and told our waitress would be right over. In the 15 minutes we sat there I made eye contact with every employee walking around the floor. Noticed several times of groups of employees just standing around talking. Not one single person, including the hostess who sat us, thought to talk to us. So after 15 minutes we walked back up to the hostess stand where she and two waitresses were standing and chatting and told them we were leaving since we weren't helped at all. She just looked at us like a deer in headlights and never said a word. Not even an apology. Lousy service and attentiveness to their clients.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Super excited for the new location, especially that pickup is now available! Really confident for those not in the area or who might not be able to afford delivery fees.  We got our meal last night using UberEats. The price is average, but with an app deal it came out to only $6 (a steal!)  My only disappointments came with the burgers themselves. The taste was great in the patty - really flavorful and filling. However, I paid extra for ketchup and lettuce on the Chris Style and barely got any (see photos). It was also suppose to have fries on top if you check the menu on the website. I think my actual burger had two.   Nonetheless, it was still a good burger, even without receiving my desired add-ons. The Beast Style fries were a mess and okay at best compared to other places. A mixture of mayo, cheese, some spice, pickles, and an array of other ingredients. We added bacon but the recipe is more for a stomach ache then a delicious treat.  Overall not bad, considering it comes from a ghost kitchen. I do recommend the burgers, but if you go in person make sure you get what you paid for.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"My friends and I like to go to all kinds of Asian restaurants. We go for Vietnamese food weekly. Tonight, two of us decided to try this shit hole.   Our waitress was tentative in that she took our order and brought out our food however,  she never came to check on us until we flagged her down.   We had the salad rolls which where good enough and then we ordered the lemon grass chicken and the curry chicken with coconut rice.   The waitress only brought out the lemon grass. We waited about five minutes then decided to split half of it on to the appetizer plates she had left on the table.    Initially I felt the chicken tasted weird.  I even said to my friend ""the chicken sort of tastes like dog food smells"".   About ten minutes later the second entrée came out and we decided to try a few spoonfuls of this one as well.  After two bites my friend put his spoon down and said ""I can't eat this. The chicken is really off.""  After trying it I unfortunately had to agree.   We piled the food back onto the serving dishes and proceeded to wait about twenty minutes until we were able to flag the waitress down. Was she ignoring us?   When she came over we explained that we ate the salad rolls,  we had our drinks,  and in desperation we had ate the plain side of coconut rice. Other then that we weren't able to eat anything else because the chicken was off and disgusting. she took away the dishes and came back with a bill for the entire ""meal"". I advised her we wouldn't be paying for the main entrées as we hadn't eaten them.  She said she would get her manager.   The manager -  a middle aged Asian man -  came over and addressed my friend saying they had tasted the chicken and it was fine and we had clearly eaten half of the first dish. I spoke up and said no.  It wasn't fine.  And no we aren't happy with it. We ate half as we split it and were waiting so long.   He turned his back completely on me and continued talking to my friend saying we obviously weren't used to curry and it wasn't for everyone.   I again attempted to tell this man where he could put his meal but he only wanted to speak to my male friend. The man clearly should be  the one making decisions. At this point I am enraged by his discusting behaviour toward me and the fact he had tasted our, hopefully filled with the common flu bug, meal and declared us too white for curry.   By the end we only paid for the appetizer and drinks and needless to say left very unhappy. It's hard finding places to eat in Terwillegar.

"I let several hours go by before I sat down to write this review. I have been wanting to check out Alma, and we finally made it over there for a late brunch today. It looked like there would be a long wait, even at 1:00, but in only about 5 minutes we were seated inside. Off to a good start! The three of us ordered coffees and set about trying to make food decisions, which was hard. We wanted to try everything! It took at least 20 minutes for us to get our coffees, probably longer, but they were so delicious we moved on. We told our server we wanted the meat pies as an appetizer to calm our hunger,  put in our entrée orders, and settled in to wait. Unlike other restaurants I've dined in this year, staffing didn't seem to be an issue for Alma at all. So was it a kitchen problem or a server problem that we didn't get food for an HOUR? We watched tables all around us get theirs and mentioned it to our server several times...when it did finally appear two dishes were missing the additional chorizo and the appetizer meat pies NEVER came. She brought them out after we had our entrees, though she could have taken them off the bill for all we cared at that point. No apologies for the ridiculous wait time for food or for how screwed up everything was, just an automatic 18% tip that wasn't deserved.

The pizza is nothing out of this world, but I think it's pretty good (I'd recommend a slice of the cheese or sausage pizza, but I know people who go bananas for their tomato pie) and yeah, sometimes the girls behind the counter can be a little mopey, but it's a perfect place to go grab a slice if you're starving and need fuel. And if you're not cool with whatever type of crowd is in there, just go sit outside at one of their tables.

Ordered delivery-  delivery very fast.  Food not so good.  Ordered sweet and sour chicken for my daughter and the sauce was on the chicken and not on the side.  I was very disappointed.  My daughter is young and does not like the sauce.  I usually order it because it usually comes on the side.  Then we use the sauce for the crab ragoon and egg rolls.  I did not specify so that's my fault for assuming.  The crab ragoon and pork egg roll was very good.  The crispy chicken was also good and sauce was on the chicken so it wasn't very crispy.  It's kind of similar to sesame chicken.  Then I ordered my favorite Chinese food item beef  lomein.  The noodles were good but the beef was dry had no flavor.

"We came on a college night, so our IDs were checked at the door. No big deal of course, we're overage. This was the 4th place we went to on our bar hop and got there around 9, and at that time until 11pm, mixed drinks are just 3 bucks. So that's a pretty unbeatable deal. Unless of course it's 2 or 1.   I had a bourbon and ginger and the wife started with a vodka and cranberry. While we were drinking we looked at the menu and ordered an appetizer. We got the cheesesteak egg rolls. These were pretty good served with a mayo and horse radish sauce. It was my first time having horse radish purposely to my knowledge and was happily surprised with the flavor. I'll be looking it up after this review.   As we waited for our appetizer, my wife saw a blue drink across the bar and asked if it was a blue motorcycle, but we were told it was a Great Piece of Ass. A name I know lol! But it was very tasty. Not too sweet and one where the alcohol will sneak up on you later...not a story for Yelp. Lol!   The place wasn't very crowded at all and the environment was cool and laid back. Most folks kind of kept to themselves. There is a nice sized dance floor here though, so the place has the potential to be a nice after hours venue.

"I can only speak for the slice I had, which was not good.  It was not bad mind you, but I would never order it again.

"This past Saturday , 10 college educated professional African American women went to BRAVO in Castleton Square to celebrate a birthday. Please note, our party had made reservations several days prior to our arrival so even though they didn't know our ethnicity, the restaurant knew it was a large birthday  dinner party.  Without going into a lot of horrendous  details...I  actually had a manager tell me I was rude because I expressed my displeasure about him literally  pulling a table from under me while I was eating to set up for another reservation. Meanwhile,  at the other end of the table, another manager was telling the ""birthday girl"" they (management) had every right to take the table I was seat at because ... get this  stereotypical statement ...""ALL YOU ALL ever do is buy drinks and appetizers!"" We couldn't quite figure out if he intended for his comment to be racist or sexist. Needless to say, the table erupted. He felt very privileged and well within his right to be arrogant and rude about his very inappropriate comment until he found out  one of the ladies in the party was an attorney The manager immediately issued several poor excuses for their behavior which only fueled more raw emotions. Even with tempers at an all-time high not one of us was unruly, cursed, or stooped to their level of stupidity. I just simply picked up my phone, called CHARLESTON, made reservations, and our entire group left the restaurant with the manager chasing after us to give each one a gift card. Too late!!!

"Came here for a wedding, spent the night at the inn, had both a catered meal at the reception, and breakfast inside the following morning.  So, I'm not pro to the Mendenhall Inn, but I've definitely sampled pretty much all they have to offer.  :)  I'm going to go in chronological order, and highlight the pros and cons.  CHECK-IN  PROS:  * Clean lobby, very friendly and inviting. * Covered area to pull up and check in during inclement weather; it was raining that afternoon, so this was quite welcomed. CONS: * Wow, what shoddy service... The woman checking everyone in did so in a one-by-one fashion, which is fine, but not when the rooms aren't all ready.  We were arriving for a wedding that afternoon, and though they were only promising a room ready by 3pm, many people were being checked in before we got to the front.  When we did get up there, our room was NOT ready.  So, we spent 15 minutes in line waiting for something it took her a second to check.  Maybe she was too busy... but what about the receptionist sitting about five feet away from her, not interacting with the long line at all, not helping, not even making eye contact?  That's just plain ignorant customer service.  Then, the woman who was checking us in said she couldn't even check us in without our room being ready yet.  Some line about ""that's how our computer system works.""  Yeah, bull. * So, anyway, we had to just hang out or go get a drink somewhere, which we did (Buckley Tavern, yay!), all the while pondering the wasted quarter of an hour that we could have spent getting dressed/made up in another room.  Disgraceful.   * Here's the kicker, and what really ticked us off.  When we came back almost an hour later, another person, possibly a manager, was also helping to check people in.  Where was he before?  Both women from earlier were there, the first one still doing her gig, and the second actively running back and forth, but still not making eye contact with any customers.  What was her actual role, I wonder?  Anyway, the guy checks us in, and clearly he knows how to work the computer system I guess, because our original room was STILL not ready, but he found us one that was!  Imagine that!  The power this guy must have had, where he could click and type and make magically appear a room of exact description where we could rest our weary heads and change before the rapidly approaching nuptial ceremony! * Okay, so, I'm a little bitter, whatever.  Anyway, long story short, I know you're a busy inn with a lot of events, but that's why you plan accordingly.  Hire more staff on a temp basis if you have to, but get the rooms cleaned out and find the right staff for up front to check them in.  That was embarrassing for your hotel, and I certainly wouldn't want you representing me in my business.  CEREMONY/RECEPTION (in the Grand Ballroom)  PROS:  * Big space, very lovely, enchanting chandeliers and décor... * Catered dinner was agreeable, nothing too drastic in any direction. * Incredible bar-tending crew!  Very fast on the creations, knew their craft well, and were quite friendly to everyone!  CONS:  * One serves from the left and clears from the right, monsieur.  Minor complaint, but indicative of the level of training their wait staff has had. * Little things, like a light bulb out here, a hole in the wall there, not big stuff, but minor ticky-tacky stuff, but it adds up over time.  Place just needed a once-over by someone who cares greatly about the finished product. * Nothing was really standing out in the main meal.  The soup was tasty (crab/asparagus, we think), but the salad was kind of bland, the chicken was a bit dry, and the white sauce was borderline flavorless and incognito.  Hardly memorable fare, at least not for the right reasons.  ROOM  PROS: * VERY comfortable bed!  I got a great night's sleep. * Clean.  Hopefully a given this day and age, but want to point it out all the same. * Powerful shower head, and up at a good height for a tall person.  I didn't have to crouch over to wash my hair!  Being a taller gent, I appreciate that. * Free WiFi!  CONS:  * Not super huge, but that's a minor complaint.  BREAKFAST  PROS:  * Great selection of items, most of which seemed to be very fresh. * Make-your-own waffles!  Always a good idea, especially for the kids!  CONS: * Sausage was inedible, very disgusting. * Potatoes were undercooked and bland.  OVERALL  The convenience of having the wedding, reception, and rooms all in one place was phenomenal, and I would readily stay here again for such an event.  The hidden gem was the restaurant attached, which we kind of took over after the reception.  The calamari was actually pretty darn tasty, too!  I'd be wary about checking in, but overall a good place to stay.  I'd like to go back and try the restaurant for dinner someday.  Looked very tempting.  Bartenders were really awesome there, too!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The pad Thai was absolutely delicious, as was the Gnocchi.  I'm not a fan of mushrooms so I really didn't care for the sauce the gnocchi  came in, but otherwise the gnocchi  made up for it because they were really good. The tacos were also good, I would have preferred a little more filling.

We had to repeatedly ask for more drinks - I would assume at a ""brew house"" they would be pretty eager to get you another beer when yours was running low, but apparently not the case.   Food was actually pretty bad.  I had the driest grilled chicken I've ever had in my life and what I swear were instant mashed potatoes.  My husband's salad was ok enough.   It was on par with airline food and not with the $90 bucks two of us spent on our meal.  The loaded fries as an appetizer were decent.

"This place rocks. I just came back from NOLA and one night my friend and I were walking about trying to find a place. We didnt' know what we wanted but we just couldn't eat anymore fried food. We stumbled on this place, mainly cause we heard the amazing 3 person band outside in their courtyard. While we were reading the menu to decide to go in, the music was pulling us in. The menu was extensive so we thought heck the music is so good perhaps we would be fine if the food was so so. But there was so much to choose from we took the leap. Thank the stars that we did. We sat out in the courtyard. The music was awesome. Sadly I forgot what the band called themselves, but they definitely deserved a shout out. Now I would give this place 5 stars except for the fact that our table was dirty and the service was very very slow and my waitress did not know what a peppermill was. Our table cloth was so dirty with other people's food stains we had to lift the glass and turn the table cloth over so we wouldn't see the nastiness. Now in saying that, we did look inside the restaurant and it was very clean and nice inside, but no table clothes.   Now back to the food. I'm a NYC foodie. And everything we ordered was AMAZING. The different textures, and levels of flavors was a serious party in our mouths. So much so we called out the chef, so we could shake his hand and take a picture with him.   Some must try dishes:  - Oyster Rockefeller Dip... seriously Oh MY GOD!!! - Southern Style Baby Back Ribs... Im the Queen of BBRibs amongst my friends and their ribs made me want to clap.  - Spinach Salad... YUM  GREAT PLACE YOU MUST GO.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I would give it less stars if I could. So many uniquely horrible things happened in one ""dining"" experience. Let me count the ways..... 1. The women's restroom was absolutely trashed. Wet floors, sinks overflowing, toilet paper everywhere, and a full box of toilet paper out in the open. One of the stalls was even out of order.  2. We were put in a section that clearly had no assigned server and had not been bussed.  3. Our server took over 15 minutes to get any drinks on the table, which were never once refilled. My brother filled them for us as he went up and asked the bartender.  4. Once our app order had been placed, it took another 20 minutes to get our entree order placed. After we sat waiting for our apps for another 40 minutes, I decided to ask for a manager. The manager never showed up. Instead, the poor server was sent back over to tell us, ""So sorry, all of the ticket times have been running long at about an hour and a half."" Once again, I asked to speak to a manager and once again they never showed up. We left.   As a server for many years, I do understand that things happen and ticket times do run long. But also as a server, I understand that ticket times should never run that long and if anything comes close to that someone should have been at the table to apologize. The lack of care from the staff and managers was astounding. The state of this restaurant gave me anxiety. The only one redeeming quality of this place is the location.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

We ordered online pick up and we're not able to give the option for add anything to the coffee so I was a tad disappointed with the iced coffee but my boyfriend polished it off no problem. I got the Sunrise Bagel that included bacon, egg, cheese, etc. and it tasted like heaven. A hearty simple meal on the go! It was very overcrowded in the restaurant when we went to pick up.

"We had to wait a little while, but (pro tip) we grabbed some drinks at Bodovino Ristorante next door. They have a super cute patio, and you can watch the water/light show in the plaza center.   We got a prime spot on the outdoor patio where we got an even better view of the water/light show. I don't know how to better describe it, but it's pretty amazing and entertaining with the good tunes they're playin' out there. The restaurant is 5/5 on ambiance and lighting. There are some TVs around which I found a little out of place but welcomed them once shop-talk started happening around me. Dog shows were on, so yippee for me.  Everything here is expensive, both drinks and food -- and nothing I tried convinced me that their prices are actually worth it. The server was forgettable, lackluster and didn't check back that often.   Drink prices are of course not listed. I believe I got the Cucumber Southside which was fine. I obviously forgot what it was. I then switched to beer as I had a feeling it would be stupid expensive to get more cocktails.  We tried some Avocado Rolls (no description on the menu besides the dipping sauce), and guess what, for $15, there is ONLY avocado in these rolls! Booooring. They were just okay, and there's only 3 pieces. So that's a whopping $5 a piece. I coulda bought like 7 avocados for that much.   Thankfully we decided to split an entrée rather than us each getting our own -- the surf and turf for $39. You get a few choices on what kind of cut and roll you want, but FYI, you get up-charged if you want a more ""special"" roll. We ordered the ribeye. It was decent, but a small cut. They cleverly deliver the dish on a little cutting board with the roll and some green beans so it takes up the space, making it look bigger than it actually is. The Las Vegas roll was okay, too, but they only give you 6 pieces.   Overall, cool lounge-y place to stop for a drink BEFORE real dinner somewhere else, but I would not have multiple drinks or food. It's a ripoff for the whole she-bang. The quality does not match up with what you have to fork over.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

They dont take reservations and they dont do call backs so you have to WAIT AT THE LOCATION to get seated. At this point, I'm going to stop trying here as its simply not worth the inconvenience of waiting  so long for eggs and pancakes. I would skip this place and go to Square One coffee instead just down the block for some gourmet coffee in a great cafe-like environment (way better than starbucks).

The garlic bread is not bad, but we should have ordered a salad instead. They all looked amazing! We were encouraged to share a large deep dish pizza with the cornmeal crust.

Frankly, I was shocked to see that this store seemed so dismally boring and uninviting. First, as I went to look for a yummy flavored Colombian-brew, they did not have any in the thermos. I had to make my way around a guy who seemed desperately unamused and sweeping the floor while people were trying to hustle around him for their fountain drinks or fresh squeezed lemonade.   The cashier was not friendly, nor were any of the other people who were there. I didn't even want to order food on account of the unhappy associates.   I used the bathroom and it smelled bad and it was not clean. I don't know if they don't see homeless people using the facilities or if people that go in there are just downright disgusting, but I will not choose to pee here again...

The sweet potatoes are out of this world. Eat the sweet potatoes and hot water cornbread together. The mac and cheese is good (not super cheesy) - it was not really seasoned spicy (which is more my style), but was nice.   I ordered the popcorn shrimp, and the first one she brought out was pretty overcooked, and when I tasted it is tasted like it had been fried in old oil. I didn't feel like bringing it up, but in 5 minutes, she brought over a perfectly cooked (and way better seasoned) order of popcorn shrimp. She said she told them the fix me another one - I thanked her. The fresh batch was great - simply seasoned with salt and (maybe lemon?) pepper. I ordered a jack and coke, really nice pour.

I wasn't interested in today's soup options, so went for onion soup which I had to pay 2 extra bucks for. The onion soup was probably the best part of my lunch. The panini wasn't that good.

I wish we could clone this restaurant in San Diego!!   First of all, the building itself is FUN. It has huge vaulted ceilings that allow for a huge TV screen, which is great for sports fans. The art and decor is unique and catches your eye; Large throw rugs under industrial tables, mix match vintage chairs, chandeliers mixed with a large bar, ping pong tables. I loved it.  The food was delicious as well, we completely over ordered because we wanted to try so many things. I highly recommend the fried chicken dinner, the portion was huge and the chicken was crispy. The Buffalo wings were crispy and full of flavor; were a wonderful mix of sweet and spicy, and again a generous portion. We also tried the pretzel bites with provolone cheese dip, which were delicious but something I could live without.

The only thing saving this rating was the clam chowder (which my wife said was good) and the bread which was warm.  This was our first night in St. Pete and we were hoping that this would be a restaurant to explore on our vacation, but we'll be exploring other restaurants in the area instead.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Went here because of a Groupon deal my husband had purchased.  The food was pretty good but they seem to think they are in Center City Philly with their prices.  We did have very good service and the decor is quite nice.  The food though is definitely not the best in Ambler and certainly not the best in the area and it is very expensive for what you get.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The atmosphere is three stars. It's trendy with nothing unique about it. We sat out on the patio which was nice. We started off with the hummus which we sent back. I love me some hummus but this was watery and the pita chips were VERY stale. We sub it for the fried green tomatoes which were good. They came out very bare no cheese no harsh sprinkled on to just a side of dressing to dip. Our burgers finally came which seemed like a very long time, unlike the Pharmacy right down the road who is scary fast at serving your burgers. The burgers looked like a fast food burger. Smashed, flat, and very sad. If i'm spending 13 dollars on a burger I hope it looks appealing as well. But seriously, it looked very sad. My cold fries also were maybe a sign that the food had been ready awhile but sat under the heat laps for a bit. All in all this place is walking distance for me so it's convenient but unfortunately I won't be back. This was my second time to give them a shot.

"I love the Boise Fry Co especially now that it's changed locations. The new building is extremely open and bright with cool natural wood tables and a comfy leather couch that creates a nice place for the visitors of Guru Donuts that shares the building space with BFC.   I've been here a lot with different people and it has always been good reviews from everyone. The reason I'm doing 4 stars is because over time, in my opinion, I think that the burger has become more consistent in quality and taste. I've tried the different combinations of toppings they offer and I think the original is the way to go. It's a solid burger that doesn't need too much dolling up.   When it comes to the fries, PURPLE IS QUEEN. My goodness I love the purple fries. Can you tell? It's so cool that they come all natural, whatever the fry, and you get to add the seasoning and different dipping not sauces to it.   Overall, I would recommend BFC for a good burger and even better fries.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Best AYCE sushi and top notch Chinese food in Reno.  They have the freshest fish and top notch service.  The nigiri are deftly cut and rolls are creative.  Their hamachi and sake nigiri melts in your mouth l like butter.  The sushi chefs are friendly and personable.    Intimate setting and just plain amazing Chinese food.  Pot stickers stuffed with minced pork and vegetables wrapped in a thin casing that achieved nirvana by being crunchy and golden brown on one side only, juicy inside.  The sea bass is is cooked to perfection and it lightly flakes off of to swim in a honey sauce that creates a perfect symphony.  The chef, Quoc puts his pizazz into the chili oil and XO paste.  It's has wealth of flavor but not one over powers the other - a must try since they make it themselves.

"The Little One is little. The ambiance, attitude of the waitress etc. is designed to be ""cool"" and ""hip"". The restaurant reminded me of ""Two Sisters Bakery"" in Homer, Alaska. However, there is a big difference between the two. The ""Twin Sister Bakery"" food is very good; ""the Little One"" food on the other hand is average. I ordered the prickly pear lemonade and sopa. The drink was awesome. The soup was average at best. My wife ordered a pineapple mint juice and chicken mole. Her food was also mediocre. We have had much better mole at other places. The menu looks interesting though. This is a good place to go if you work nearby or you are in downtown for some other reason.

The Food: I've had the wings. Not bad. On Saturday though.. I was in the mood for a tuna melt. I should have sent it back. The bread was grilled.. But the tuna was cold and the cheese wasn't melted!!

It was pretty awesome, good decision and will definitely come back again. Prices were just right and the food was full of flavors. Ordered the steak frites and the duck l'orange and our waiter was very persistent and good for first time comers. Reason for 4 star was I wasn't dying for the flavors, I think it could be better but hey my whole family are chefs and nothing is better than a home cooked meal. :)  A little tip: try to sit inside if you're coming in when it's almost dinner time if it's not busy, although there were space heaters on the top, it didn't do much justice and I was freezing but ya know to each their own.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"If I could offer negative stars, this would rate -5! I received a gift certificate for this place from my husband for $800 and was so looking forward to some serious pampering. I made reservations for a poolside deluxe king bed room months before my 4 day stay. Sounds like an amazing plan, yes? Well this is the breakdown. Checked into my room which wreaked of mold and realized that I was not by a pool but actually down a back alley with a large tent set up feet away from my patio. I had to get away from the smell so I opted to grab some lunch. Due to the fact I was alone I suppose, I was invisible to the waiters who passed me by for over a half hour before even setting a place at my filthy table or offering water. I choked down my wilted salad and never had a single person check on me till I was ready to pay my bill. Honestly would have been less painful to have skipped out...took another 1/2 hour to flag someone down to take my card. I decided to have a service done to avoid going back to the moldy dungeon they call a deluxe room and will say my facial was amazing. After getting relaxed and shiny I was pretty ready to crash and call it a day. Guess what? There was a large and booming wedding just gearing up directly over my head. The partying went on till well after 2:00 a.m. and drunken guests made themselves comfortable on the chairs and table on my patio. They left cups and cigarettes behind as a morning souvenir for me. I spoke with the concierge on duty at 7:00 a.m. the next tired morning and she acted empathetic saying she would get me another room ASAP. I sat by the pool after booking a few more services and repeatedly checked in with her to see if another was ready. Finally my last service was ready...getting a manicure and pedicure, and I called her from my chair. She was gone for the night! No room change had been arranged...it was now 5:30 at night and I wanted to cry. One sweet girl who worked for the spa desk, saw my desperation and ran around for an hour to resolve things. As I was winding up the service, she came to me and told me I had a new room. Now completely exhausted, I headed down to my previous room to retrieve my things and get resettled. Didn't take long in that I was moved one room down to yet another mold infested pictureless room with shredded furniture, chipped paint, no A.C., filthy rug and broken mini fridge. Somehow I endured that evening though when I woke up parched in the middle of the night and went to get ice I discovered all the ice machines in the entire wing were yanked from the walls leaving evidence of sole pipes sticking out of walls. The spa water fountains they boast about were also MIA...a spa that made its reputation on its artisanal water and I suffered from thirst through the night. I checked out a day early at 7:00 the next morning with the same concierge I originally spoke with who acted as if she had never laid eyes on me...no apology...no explanation....no refund for the early checkout. At this point I couldn't wait to just get back home and take a hot shower to clean myself off from the possible bed bugs that may have hitchhiked onto me. The assistant general manager did return a call I had made to the manager the first day and after listening to my details claimed to be sending a voucher for a free night. This was 3 months ago...no voucher was sent...would never have used it anyway!  Stay clear away from this abominable place at all cost!

"We went here during restaurant week, thanks to my weakness for French food. Was happy to find out they were BYO friendly.  Location was definitely very cool, although a bit weird to walk through all the retail space when the stores were closed.  The evening started with our fantastic server Matthew, very charismatic and knowledgeable. Next was the amuse bouche, a truffled mushroom soup, which was divine...except for the piece of glass in one of the party's serving, much to our dismay. When Matthew was alerted go the issue, he immediately apologized and gave her a drink on the house.  The escargot and salmon appetizers were excellent. They neglected to pull our plates prior to the main course, causing a delay in arrival  (and thus slightly cold entrées). The duck and lamb entrées were delicious, cooked perfectly. For dessert we enjoyed the apple tartin (very good) and proftieroles (decent).  Great ambiance, great server, decent food. The food service was just good, which I attribute to the kitchen, not our waiter. Likely not somewhere I'd go again, now that I've been. Spring Mill Café in Conshohocken definitely surpasses Bistro St Tropez for my French food cravings.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"This would be a 3 1/2 star review if that was possible. Let's call it 4-star for ambiance and 3-star for food. I've eaten at 1111 Mississippi twice. It's a hip place. I really like the multi-level set-up, the open kitchen, and the overall ambiance. I have one seating complaint however. There is one area in the building that has the unfortunate setup where you have a long both on one side and 2-tops down the row of the booth. You have strangers squeezed in on each side of you and that's just an uncomfortable and awkward seating arrangement. If you are an extrovert as I am most of the time it is a great way to make new friends, but on the other hand it is not conducive to engaging in a private conversation and a private meal. I know this is pretty common in trendy spots, I'm just not a fan of this setup.   Service. My experience on my first trip to 1111 Mississippi was pleasant. Our server was very engaging and gregarious. He certainly added to our experience. He did an outstanding job of making recommendations and helping me steer clear of items that he thought weren't the best. On my second trip I spent a few minutes at the bar before sitting down. The bar is welcoming and the bartenders were friendly and helpful offering us samples of a few beers that we had some questions about. Unfortunately, our server on my second visit was not nearly as vivacious as on my first try to 1111. She was quite stiff and really not all that fun. She was efficient but didn't do much to enhance our experience. Obviously, a good or not-so-good server can make or break an experience at a restaurant.   The food. I've been mildly disappointed by the food on both of my sojourns to 1111 Mississippi. I really had high hopes for outstanding meals. Don't get me wrong, the food was by no means bad. It just wasn't at the level that I expected based on 1111's reputation. On my first stop I had the artichoke bottoms appetizer and ordered the pork chop for dinner. Neither knocked my toupee off.   On my second trip we had a cheese plate which was really excellent. Our mostly spiritless server really did do an excellent job of assisting us with our cheese selections. This was by far my favorite part of my meal. I had the sea bass for my entree. The sea bass was on a bed of mushroom risotto which was in fact quite good. I'm not a sea bass expert but it definitely seemed to be a bit overcooked. My guest had the filet mignon special. The steak was disappointing. Although it was cooked to proper temperature, it had a strong charred taste on the outside. The steak was accompanied by mashed potatoes which were fairly pedestrian.   I really want to like 1111 Mississippi and chances are that I will give it another shot at some point. Next time I will ask what the very best items on the menu are and give them a shot. If I'm disappointed after then that then it will be doubtful that I'd return, except maybe for some cheese...",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I used to come here but it became less appealing when their alternative vibe just turned into I could give a sh*t vibe. I was greeted today by an apathetic waitperson who seemed angry I was asking questions about their buffet and the pricing - I had to drag the info out of her. After purchasing the pizza, breadstick, and salad buffet I found the meager offerings of pizza choices dried out, virtually no breadsticks what were there were hard and dry, and the lettuce bowl almost empty. Some of the dressing bottles empty. Granted, I came in at the tail end of lunch (1:30) so I anticipated things wouldn't be as prime as when they are refreshing the pizza more often. Still I wouldn't have bothered to write this review under those circumstances .  Then I overheard a customer asking for the breadsticks they normally get  whenever they come. The menu reads free breadsticks for dine-in patrons. The same angry waitperson seemed to be arguing about whether this woman was entitled to breadsticks of her own. It was pretty clear they needed to make some fresh ones for the buffet so it seemed likely they could make enough for this woman and for the buffet. Either way I was looking forward to something fresh as nothing else seemed to be. I didn't pay much attention to the rest of the conversation but after I was seated the waitperson came to their table and started yelling at the woman then came back and slammed an order card on the table and marched off. The woman looked like she'd been slapped, the children were staring at the waitperson with their mouths gaping open. Apparently the cost of breadsticks is greater than the cost of losing customers . I'll never be back and I think it goes without saying neither will the woman and children.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I really got mad during having dinner at this restaurant. We were in Reno 2 days ago, after playing at Circus Circus, my kids were hungry so I decided to go to Golden Flowers restaurant. The taxi driver who drove us to there gave a lot of compliments about it and that's why we were so excited. The first experience is that the restaurant was crowded at that time (abt 10pm) and we had to wait for 30 mins to get a table, but that's fine.      Then we ordered 1 beef noddles soup, 1wonton, 1 chicken salad, 1 vnamese drink, 1 apple juice (but they didn't have it so we changed to lemonade). We had to wait more 30 mins for the meal and one of my kids started to cry because of hungry and sleepy. That's terrible!       When I asked the manager (I'm not sure she is a waitress or the manager but she is vietnamese and she has long black hair) when they would bring us the soup and she answered me that they were going to bring us right away, if I wanted to get the soup quickly then they have no response when my kids get stomachache! My mind was ""what the heck?"" (?!) after that, she left us behind with A POUT!        The last bad thing is after we finished the meal, the lemonade hadn't been come out but they still charged us that drink but we just remembered it when we came back to the hotel.        Abt the food, there's nothing special, and the taste of the Wonton is really not good for me to eat.

"We were in need of some sustenance after long morning of brunch and day drinking on bottomless mimosas. The menu looked somewhat decent and the customer service was good. The young lady who helped us was very pleasant to speak with and eager to help.  We ordered some steak tacos and a quesadilla to go. We were strolling magazine street on our way back to the airbnb digs. The joint is kind of setup with a one of those open food lines like you see at a Subway. They got all the ingredients set up in bins so you can pick and choose what you want and what not. They got the grill set up right there too so you can see your proteins heated up. So what you see is what you get! You get to see your order made from start to finish.  We managed to find our way home and threw a grub down. Truth be told everything looked very aesthetically pleasing to the eye. But the taste was not as pleasing. I think it lacked seasoning really. The steak was also pretty tough, didn't break apart very easily when bitten. The quesadilla probably could have been toasted a bit longer to give the tortilla more texture. Other than that it was decent. It came with guacamole which needed some seasoning too.

"The food is the same, only the prices for everything have doubled. It was one thing to pay $2 for a Coke and another $2 for each refill and $3.50 for a Bud lite when the food was cheap. After all, they have to make money somewhere. Those days are over. Apparently they've decided that they're going to squeeze every last penny they can by doubling the prices of literally everything on the menu and raising the prices of the drinks by 1 to 2 dollars per drink. 2.75 for a fountain drink that cost 8 cents is gouging plain and simple and charging the same price for each refill is criminal. The crowd there reflected the massive price increase. They were staying away in droves. In the timeframe we were there they had 60 food orders, normally they would've had over 200 food orders. It's now an overpriced tourist trap, it's glory days are over. We used to go and get cheap food and didn't mind if the drinks were pretty pricey, but now the food is twice the price and the already expensive drinks are even more expensive.  The people watching is no more as well since no one goes there any more apparently.

"I'm surprised I haven't eaten here more, but I love the food they have here! I just love drizzling fish sauce over my noodles or rice and tearing into the variety of Vietnamese dishes they offer. I eat here regularly for lunch and after having had about 25% of the menu (it's huge), I haven't been disappointed yet. It's definitely out of the way if you are visiting the city, but since I work out in this part of town, it makes for a nice, tasty and light lunch.   As a bonus, there is a bakery next door that makes some decent sandwiches to go as well as some really good and cheap french bread (perfect for sopping up BBQ shrimp juice!!!)...",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
Confusing place to be. Left with more questions than answers? Where do I order? Wide open room. Is it a bakery or a coffee shop? What are the rules of etiquette? Why are coffee cups more like bowls? How long can I stay? Do I have a server? Can't I just self-serve like at every coffee shop?   I'd like it if I were on vacation.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
I know it is fast food but to wait over 10 minutes for a sandwich and then have the staff find humor  when my wife asked about it just makes me sure if I have another option for fast food I will take it .

"If I can give the place 0 star I would. Please don't order food from here. I ordered through Yelp so it said 30 to 40 minutes before you can come pick it up. Then I told my husband to go pick up the order after 20 minutes. We live literally 15 mins from the restaurant. Then the lady at the cashier said to my husband ""why waste my time and come pick up late? Why don't you go to mc Donald?"" First of all the ordered already paid for, so what is her problem? Second of all we did not come late. The lady was rude and ignorant to say that to my husband. We will never come back here again.

"Last night 20 of us went here for dinner.  Most of us had seafood which lacked flavor.  None of us were overly impressed with the food.  The inside Bartender, Eric, was rude & defensive.  When asked about two lemon drops missing the sugar & not being chilled he defensively responded it was made correctly as he made it himself.  He grabbed the drinks from me & demanded I stand there to watch him make them again.  I told him to forget it & I walked away.  When I spoke to the Manager to advise him of Eric's rudeness, he was nice but all he could say was 'sorry'.  He never offered to reimburse us for the drinks.  It was Saturday night & there were many empty tables & empty seats at the bar.  There are so many restaurants to choose from in Pinellas County, one would think any patrons they do have would be treated nicer.  You only get one chance to make a good first impression & sadly they failed.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Good solid Vietnamese food. Manshape said his beef meatball pho was very flavoursome, the fresh spring rolls (one with fried shrimp one with shrimp and avocado) were good.

"When this restaurant first opened I was a big Patron. Then I had the unfortunate experience on Friday night of their refusal to serve me because I was a single dinner. I watched various tables who came in after me get their food before mine was brought out.  So I went back recently after a long hiatus. I think their food is very good to excellent and they follow the new trend of having a Chinese menu with many Szechuan items which are much more authentic. I found most of their food to be quite good, especially the Dan Dan noodles and the number of the Szechuan spicy dishes. So I guess go in a large party and things will be fine.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Fronimo's is around the corner so we decided to place a carryout order. The service was ""meh"". Nothing bad, nothing good. Now the food. I love Gyros and nothing upsets me more than places that serve preformed patties. The meat should be on a spit, revolving and lovingly being carved off. Even the Greek place in the mall food court does this, but not Fronimo's. If I want preformed patties I'll get them myself and make my own Gyro plate. Huge fail there. I was craving one of my Greek favorites, Saganaki and they don't make it. Seriously? I don't expect a food court restaurant to make this, but I certainly expect a sit down Greek restaurant to have Saganaki. The hummus was bland and the tabbouleh was 90% parsley. Decent salad and pita bread. Honestly, the next time we want fast Greek food, we'll drive to the mall. If we want a sit down dinner, with Saganaki, we'll go to Athens on 4th.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

We had only looked up and noticed the ""decor"" halfway through the meal and felt it rude to leave then. We compensated our female wait staff generously for these hostile work conditions. In the current social and cultural climate, there is no reason to further subjugate and objectify women in a public establishment serving food. I am so thankful my children were not with me.

We waited outside the door for almost 20 minutes and once we got inside... Well, we missed the warm, friendly middleastern welcome approach. We were rushed through our serving... ""Are you done? No? Your next course will get cold, no we cannot keep it warm for you...."" It was a bit sad.... Been rushed through a great experience.... Wondering if we got there too late but then why did you let us sit so late if you knew the experience wasn't going to be so good???  PS. Bill was ~47$ each....

Unfortunately the food quality has changed with the relocation. I ordered the breakfast crepe which was disappointingly dry and crunchy with over cooked eggs and tomatoes inside.  Adding to the disappointment, the new location is really bad. It looks like a renovated fast food restaurant and although it's very clean it has no character whatsoever.

Water glass was overfilled and wet the table, but it wasn't replaced or cleaned. We asked more butter, but they ignored it.

Apparently, where he needed to go was much more important than where we needed to go. $160.00 later when it was time to sign our credit card slip, a waiter (not ours), dropped off the slips of paper and TOSSED the pen at us, said no words, and walks away.

"I was here for a work holiday party, which was executed pretty nicely. We had our own private room that had a fireplace and sat about 20 people. It was well put together and very clean. The staff and Chef greeted us with smiles and did everything they could to keep everyone happy. The menu was prefixed, so my experience was probably a little different than the average dinner there.  The appetizers were decent. They were served family style and it was more than enough to feed us all. We were given fried calamari, bruschetta, and an antipasto assortment. The antipasto was definitely my favorite; the eggplant caponata was on point and I will always have a huge soft spot for sharp provolone cheese. The bruschetta was pretty good, nothing special. The fried calamari was just okay; more than likely coming from a freezer. We had a second course served that was penne vodka, which the Chef came out and served. The pasta was slightly undercooked and there wasn't too much flavor going on. However, some of the other people I was with loved it. I ended up giving mine to the person sitting next to me. We had a few choices for dinner; veal, steak, salmon, chicken, or shrimp to keep it simple. All served with potatoes and string beans. I went with the salmon, which was alright. There wasn't too much to rave about. My beans were cold (WHY is this a trend with every restaurant), and the potatoes were bland. I did get to try some of that steak, and it was REALLY good. Perfectly cooked and I had so much regret that I didn't go for it. It was also a huge portion. It was mostly what everyone ordered.  For dessert we had a choose between plain cheesecake or chocolate mousse blackout cake. They were plated up for self serve on our tables. I went for the chocolate, and excuse me language....but that shit was pretty damn good. I sampled the cheesecake, but it didn't compare to the mousse cake for me. It was extremely rich, which was alright with  me. I had also gotten a coffee that was room temperature, my friend ended up knocking it over anyway. No big deal.  Most of the props go to the service. They were awesome at getting everything in and out with orderly fashion. The food was just okay for me and I probably wouldn't come here on my own any time soon.

"Very odd to say the least. We ordered food got an appetizer, larb dish, and another dish. Our first 2 dishes came pretty much at the same time and we were completely finished eating before our last dish even came out. Our server didn't check on us once and I was in need of multiple things, he was intentionally avoiding our table and it wasn't busy at all. We had to ask for help from someone else because our server was everywhere except by us! The food is like 1/5 also, the pork belly and broccoli dish was literally all broccoli with a tiny bit of pork belly we didn't eat it cause it came out extremely late. The larb was a sweet sweet larb that was stir fried nothing like what I was used to and had an odd stench to it. I would pass on this place if I were thinking on eating here. The Thai tea was great tho.  Update: my stomach has been turning and in knots since I ate here. Haven't been able to stomach anything since then.  Another update: it's been a full 24hrs since we've eaten here and still haven't been able to stomach anything and I'm pretty sure we both are experiencing food poisoning symptoms.

"I have seen Sketch come up on three of the best burger in Philadelphia lists (and all pretty high up) so we decided to head over to give it a try . Sketch is on Frankford Ave. in the Northern Liberties/Fishtown area of the city. We were able to find parking across the street on Frankford Ave.  The restaurant is pretty small, there is one table out front and seating for about 20 inside. Sketch is a cool, clean and  funky place.The decor is simple and very casual with plain bench type tables. The walls are decorated by hamburger art drawn by the patrons. Specials are on the wall on a chalk board. There were a ton of hipsters there on the Saturday we chose. Its all good to me as variety makes the world go round. I am amazed how much this section of the city is changing and all of the new building.  Back to Sketch, everything is made to order and on a busy Saturday evening, there were 4 people working including the cooks. Our waitress was great and very efficient. She would constantly let people know how long the wait was for booth take out and eat in.  The take out was up to 45 minutes by the time we left, but that didn't seem to daunt customers. Be patient at Sketch, you will be rewarded.  We had the Cyclops, the Onion burger and the Lamb burger special plus Belgian style fries and Sweet potato fries. The fries came out first and the Belgian fries were probably the best I have ever had. They were hot, and crispy with great seasoning. Sketch gives choices of unique dipping sauces also for the fries. My Cyclops was really good, the burger was perfect and the bacon and egg were also tasty. The bun was great too and not soggy at all. The Lamb burger had great seasoning with a hint of mint and the onion burger was very good too. Sketch is definitely up there with best burgers in the city. The prices are reasonable especially compared to Village Whiskey, Rogue. etc. for burgers. They had some nice looking home made desserts but I surrendered after the burger and fries. We were in food coma.  Sketch is CASH only so bring hard currency.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
I stopped by as I was leaving target I was thirsty so decided I would order a drink. The reason for the one star review is the Starbucks is very busy and only had one person working I waited in line and then had to wait an additional 10 minutes before the lady could take my order then when she did take my order she was rude. They also need to check their Expiration dates on their evolution fresh drinks as many of them were expired and usually I wouldn't mind but they are very perishable items.

We also ordered a milkshake - that is the reason for my star rating. The flavor was good but the consistency was weird and it seemed to have a thickening agent in it that was like tapioca. Ick.

The ribs were the only redemption.  We ordered the signature Deke's platter with BBQ Ribs & Chicken. The order came with wedges, cole slaw, and cornbread. We ordered an extra side of potato salad because we were snappily told we could NOT swap anything.  1) Customer Service:   The gentlemen taking orders was incredibly rude to us and the senior ladies that ordered before us. They asked about corn bread and snapped at them about how their orders don't get corn bread and that they had to pay extra for it. He was very curt, arrogant and discourteous .    2) The Food:                        - Wedges were so burnt I had to dig to find edible wedges but they were all broken into pieces                      - Cole Slaw-Hot and soggy no flavor                     - Potato Salad- potatoes were undercooked and the dressing was runny                     - Corn bread was small and very dry!!                     - Chicken was undercooked and tough                    + Ribs (slab) - were very good , fall off the bone great flavor                    + Good portion size  Overall, I would prob not eat here again!

I received such shoddy service and an indifferent attitude from the lady owner, I looked for another source and did not come here for several months, after weekly visits for over a year.  In a pinch, I stopped in today for some green Sumatran beans, and she looked at me as if she had never seen me before and didn't care if she never did again.  i expect this treatment from a chain, not from a small shop with owners on-site and many loyal customers. Really a shame, since I live close by and roast beans at home every week.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I must say Marrakesh is one of the most hideous, over rated, disgusting little hole in the wall. I went with few friends over The weekend and for sure we are not going back there anytime soon lol for the following reason   1- we made reservation way ahead of time and someone we still ended up in the 3rd floor, cold, dark we didn't even see what we were eating. Upper floors are nothing like the first floor they only post pictures of their first floor on the website lol it's a horror movie up there. Have you seen movie Saw?  2- regardless how many people you are, they will still bring the exact same food and exact same quantity and selection for the table and charge you fixed prices of 25$ and 20% compulsory tip without asking you. And they only take cash! wonder why lol but they never tell you until you finish eating, after your done they bring you the check that's couple hundred dollars, I mean who brings thousand dollar in cash? LOL who do they think we are? Pablo Escobar??  3- the dinner is ""7 course"" and it takes at least 45 min between each meal even though you will be done with each meal in 10 minutes, service is slowwww  4- let's talk about the food, the salad was the only good option, the second dish was sweet chicken like a cake it was horrific, the fruits were not washed, grapes full of fungus, lamb was just bones and vertebral bodies, chicken was barely cooked and so small like pigeon. Tea was cold   5- there were plates. Nor utensils. We asked many times, they kept saying yea yea one minute. Didn't seem they had any. We had to eat like cavemen all with hands from same big tray.

This place used to be very good. After they change a new ownership this place is not the same.

"Although this would be a very interesting Kitchen Nightmare's episode, the owners really should show up to supervise.  The hamburger bun was burnt (not a little but black) and they had the guts to actually serve it. The salmon in the salmon sandwich still had the skin on.  Remove the skin before putting in the sandwich.  The calamari was more like giant squid and very leathery like chewing rubber.  The halibut and vegetables were mushy.

"We went to Gio Taco Friday it was my first time eating at Gio and I didn't like it.   We got in line and started looking at the menu. We were glad it was happy hour and draft beer was half off. I ordered a Dragoon Ale, a good deal at $3.00.   This is an overly complicated menu. It is just tacos, and other similar items. I can sum it up as a few ingredients rearranged to make a menu worth of options. It sounds simple but is organized so you have to look in a couple different places (or panels on the wall) just to order tacos. Pick your meat, tortilla, and toppings. By the way the toppings, queso fresco, corn, and mango, cost $.25 each. The tacos already cost $2.50 each. Please don't charge extra for the toppings.   We ordered the blue crema steak taco, a Korean beef taco with mango topping, and a veggie taco with corn topping. They forgot the corn topping on the veggie taco but we didn't say anything. We also ordered an order of plantain chips and two happy hour beers.   So, we ordered three tacos, two happy hour beers, and an order of plantain chips and it cost over $20 That is too much for what we got.   The biggest problem was the bad tortillas. The corn tortillas had be fried or dipped in oil. They were tough and hard to eat, not good at all.   The plantain chips were tasty but most of the order was just tiny pieces. I would have liked less broken chips.   The place was crowded and tables were being reserved for a big group so people who came in after us didn't know where to sit. It was too cold to sit outside, where most of the seating area is. The view, or lack there of, reminds me of eating at the mall. You can't see anything other than other corporate looking restaurants.   There are many good restaurants and bars downtown. There are many places to get good tacos in Tucson. I don't think I will be back to Gio Taco.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

We ended up with: roast beef, green beans, mashed potatoes, collard greens, chicken liver and rice, fried shrimp, banana pudding, and chocolate pie. All of it was forgettable and/or unappealing for us except for the rolls! Those were incredibly soft and delicious. Arnold's was really busy and obviously fills a niche for Nashville!

"Conveniently located off Bruce B. Downs Boulevard, Oakley's Grille is a burger and sandwich shop offering standard American fare.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall next to Dairy Queen and is easy to drive past if you do not know where it is.  You can actually take your receipt to DQ for a discount!  It is also worth noting you can turn right into the home depot lot and use the road there to get to Oakley's Grille.  The dining area of Oakley's Grille is nothing special, an open kitchen and some tables.  Almost the same vibe as a Five Guys, but without the peanuts everywhere.  The restaurant offers online ordering, which is the option I typically go with.  If you do decide to dine in, the experience is fine, but nothing special.  The customer service is pretty average.  They are very good about asking about condiments and any extras you may need when getting takeout.  I have never been treated rudely here.  The menu at Oakley's includes a wide range of offerings.  Burgers, chicken strips, salads, Philly cheese steaks, etc.  They also offer specials on most nights of the week where you get an entrée and a side item (typically fries) for a discounted price.  For example, on Sunday chicken strips and fries are only $6.99!  Food:  Cheeseburger:  Burgers are what Oakley's advertises as their claim to fame.  Overall I would say their burgers are good but nothing special.  I think Burger 21, Burger Theory and BurgerMonger all offer better burgers at similar or cheaper prices along with a more pleasant dining environment.  With that being said, I think the Tuesday cheeseburger special is a great deal, and the burgers are definitely worth a try.  Chicken Strips:  The chicken strips at Oakley's are unlike any I have ever had at another restaurant.  They are huge white meat chicken strips with a very thin layer of  breading.  A variety of dipping sauces, including their signature Oakley's sauce, are available.  You definitely get a lot of food with this dish, but I would rate the quality as just average.    French Fries/Sweet Potato Fries:  The fries at Oakley's tend to vary in quality.  They are medium sized fries, similar in size to Five Guys.  Just like the other items, they are not bad but not great either.  I have never had a whole batch that is uniformly good.  Some are crisp while other are greasy and flimsy.  I suppose the good thing is that there is a level of cooking in each order to everyone's taste.  Oakley's Grille is a solid restaurant.  I think it is good option for anyone who lives in the area or is looking for relatively quick burger and fries at a non-chain quick counter restaurant.  The online ordering makes it a regular stop on my takeout rotation.  With that being said none of the found stands out, and most of the menu items are done better at other establishments.  If you are in the area give it a try, but I wouldn't make a special trip just to eat there.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"My return to Carlucci's was unfortunately not great. In fact, I was actually shocked with how poor my meal was. I went with the Chicken Palliard which is chicken, broccoli rabe and roasted red peppers sautéed in olive oil.  My first complaint is about the quality. Everything was really gross. The chicken was overcooked and tough, the veg was overcooked and soft, and the entire dish was swimming in oil. There had to be in excess of 10 teaspoons of oil on the plate, which is disgusting. See photo! Who wants to eat food dripping with flavorless oil?   Secondly, the portion they served was shockingly small. You're really serving me 6 strips of chicken, 1 piece of broccoli rabe and a few bits of pepper and calling it an entree? It was so small it looked completely ridiculous on the plate. And it didn't look appetizing at all. Jut a big plop of overcooked food in a pool of oil. Terrible execution guys.  Considering how much I enjoyed my last meal, I'm really surprised about how bad it was this time around. One star. They should be embarrassed to serve food like this.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"My burger was amazing.  The problem is everything else doesn't make me want to come here unless someone really really wanted to come and there were only 4 of us.  First problem was that they obviously don't know how to under-promise things when giving a time frame for when a party of 9 can be seated.  Initially it was 5 minutes that ballooned to 20+.    For the 9 of us they stuck us at a booth with a table tacked on the end so that one person was stuck having to face off waitresses and busboys walking around.  They have a 4 check minimum.  I'd imagine that the limit is more for the time needed to process them, as opposed to the cost, but with the service is so freaking slow to begin with, they could have been more accomodating.    It took so freaking long for our food to come out:  more than 45 minutes.  Service from our waitress was mediocre.  The busboys wandering around were much more accomodating (getting sauces/items that were missed and getting a basketball game on the tv).  OH YEAH, SAUCES AND ITEMS WERE MISSED!  My burger was freaking awesome, though:  Kobe provolone cheeseburger on a chiabatta bun with - wilted spinach, portobella shrooms, proscuitto, and pesto.

The Rainbow was a basic roll and the Tampa roll had cooked fish.  They were both okay.  I was really looking forward to the Volcano roll but it wasn't what I expected.  The krab topping tasted overcooked, just not good.      We also shared the tempura banana split.  I think the vanilla ice cream and tempura bananas were worth 1/2 star.   They do offer sushi platters that looked good too.  Maybe I'll try that next time, if I'm in the area.

"I only regret that I've lived in Indianapolis so long without going here. If you're looking for delicious Italian food for an affordable price tag, this is your spot! I was so impressed. A family of four had a 3-course meal for $60 before tip -- score!   Each entree includes your choice between a salad and a soup. I tried the minestrone soup and the house salad with a pesto ranch dressing and loved both. Meals also come with carb-y deliciousness in the form of a loaf of bread. I had the spinach and cheese ravioli and loved it, while my boyfriend loved the chicken parmesan. The meal finished off with the perfect small size of spumoni ice cream (pistachio, chocolate, and cherry).   This restaurant is simply gorgeous with so many different things to look at. I personally loved the dim lighting and thought it was relaxing, but some people in my group weren't a huge fan of that.   We had amazing service and I only have positives to say about this place.

"Very interesting food here. We did the buffet so we could get a good sampling of several dishes. The food wasn't labeled, but the chef came over and walked us through what was there since we had a vegetarian and a gluten free person in our group. I still didn't get the names of all the dishes.  They had a tilapia with vegetables, white rice, fried plantains, chicken, a cheesy potato and vegetable dish, a beef stew type dish, and a dark rice with beans. My favorites were the chicken, the potatoes, the dark rice and then the meat stew. The tilapia was good. The fish was salty and a bit dry, but the flavor was really good and we actually liked that it was dry.   The chef was friendly and happy to explain all the food to us. He also explained the differences between Haitian food versus the food from other Caribbean countries. Very knowledgeable and prions of his heritage. I loved talking to him. There also happened to be a large group there that night, and several of them seemed to know the chef or maybe they were just friendly, but several of them stopped to talk to us and ask us how we liked the food. It was a really great atmosphere.  They did have a small selection of beers and a list of specialty drinks (juices and coffees). A few other patrons left with large jars of juice looking very happy about it, so I'll have to try one of those next time. I only had water this round, which was served in plastic water bottles instead of from the tap, which I don't love. I drink a lot of water when I eat, but I don't like using all those plastic bottles, so I had to limit what I drank.  I definitely want to go back and try some of the food from the regular menu.

"Tucson is full of great local eateries. In any part of town, you can find at least two really good spots to take your favorite foodie to impress them (or maybe yourself). Agustin Kitchen should be at the top of your list. As if it weren't cool enough that everything is seasonal, locally sourced and expertly prepared, the service is excellent and the atmosphere is fun and inviting.  We had calamari to start and although the calamari is the star of the dish, the bell pepper was so fresh and flavorful that I'm compelled to mention it. No really, trust me on this.  Braised pork shank and enchilada. The pork shank was perhaps the best prepared piece of pork I've ever had. The lemon mashed potatoes and apple slaw were delicious, paired well with each other and nicely presented. The enchilada's were equally good. So much more than one-note cheese and salsa (don't get me wrong, that can be good too). But rather 5 or 6 different flavors, all well balanced and all fresh, bright and equal.  Chocolate bread pudding. We weren't sure what to expect as every chef has their own twist on bread pudding. We thoroughly enjoyed this. Topped with pistachio gelato and toasted coconut, we scrapped it clean.  So...... are there plenty of good places to eat? Yah.

"I've studied food microbiology and I'm acutely aware that you're much more likely to good food poisoning from uncooked food than from cooked food. I also think teenagers are generally dirty (present company excepted!).  So with their teenage staff, this Saladworks had my queezey meeter set on high sensitivity.   The place looks generally clean and I didn't see any servers cleaning their ears, so I was pretty much at ease. My wife and I both had salads (I think they also serve soup and sandwiches).  I was surprised that the salads on the menu were pretty generic; nothing really very exciting or unusual.  My chicken Caesar salad was fine and about the right size for lunch; I didn't have any leftovers, my wife brought home about a third of hers.  While eating though, I did start to question the true cleanliness of the place.

We sat at the bar ordered our tea and chai latte's and enjoyed a wonderful sweet potato hash and Maple Bacon Sandwich on deliciously fresh foccacia bread.  I don't recommend this place for large groups as it seems relatively small, but if you're in a mood for a delicious meal with quality ingredients I recommend this place for you.

"This is a great spot for AYCE hotpot! We had a party of 4 and we all got the hotpot and kbbq combo for $32. The price, I would say, is worth the money. The soups were flavorful, which we got the Szechuan spicy, Tom yum, and tomato! The meats, fish balls, and seafood provided is great! However, my only concern is that we are still in a pandemic and all the customers are using the same tongs. I didn't see any gloves provided either. Another complaint is with the AYCE kbbq meats, which didn't seem very fresh and the quality of the meats weren't outstanding either.The sauce bar provides many choices for you, however, it had the same issue with everyone using the same scoops/spoons.   One suggestion I would give is for them to provide tongs for the customers to get the food from the buffet.  Our server was attentive and provided excellent service for us.   Also, if you aren't seated by the conveyer belt, you won't have much access to the veggies and noodles provided unless you request them.   Lastly, the teas were a great addition to the meal. I got the passion fruit green tea, which was a bit too sweet for me, but was a nice contrast to the salty foods.

Also the flavor was not there AT ALL. The cheese layer was almost non-existent and there was plenty of barren real estate around the edges - lots of crust. Also most of the toppings were shifted to one side. We have two remaining pieces that the dog may get to enjoy.  We might give them another shot, might not.

"We ate here twice during our trip to Nashville.  The first time there were four of us and we ate a late lunch in the bar area.  Very clean and it smells of smokey bbq in the joint.  All four of us shared our lunch.  For drinks I tried Blue black jack, pearthanon cumberland cucumber and the whiskey nelson.  I liked them all but the pearthanon was the best.  We started out with the fried pickles and they were great.  The Row offers a couple of different bbq sauces including a spicy white sauce that I liked very much.  We also shared the catfish tacos which were very good as well.  Then we had the pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese.  Both awesome.  The pork was some of the best I have ever had.  Smokey goodness.    On our second trip we had a party of eight for dinner.  We were seated promptly at a large table.  For apps we had the fried pickles and I used the coupon off yelp to get them for free.  We also had the fried green tomatoes and the deviled eggs five ways.  The eggs were great.  To this day, I don't understand why more restaurants have deviled eggs on the menu.  For dinner, I had the brisket plate with the smashed potatoes.  It was good but I thought the pork was better.

We liked that there were options for indoor and outdoor seating, and they have highchairs too!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"First time visiting New Orleans and decided to check out this restaurant since it was near our hotel. Unfortunately, the experience was terrible. Our waitress, April, took our order then proceeded to take several smoke breaks outside, which caused us to ask other staff members to locate her. It wasn't busy, and the Bourbon side wasn't open yet, so for our order to be sitting and delivered unfresh was upsetting. The other servers even began apologizing for her. Definitely won't be back, nor would we ever recommend it to others. Thanks a lot April!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Last Sunday before the game we went for drinks.  Started off with a great bartender that was talkative and attentive!  She was very pleasant but took off without letting us know.  The service was poor and inattentive from there on.  Eric, our server,  served me a glass with someone else's lipstick on it and when we brought his attention to it, he poured the drink from one glass to another with a minimal apology as he walked off.  Then, after he was flagged down to place another drink order, he proceeded to walk off and wait about 10 minutes to serve the drinks.  When he finally poured the drinks there was a noticeably large fruit fly that came out of the bottle.  The server acted as though he had not seen or heard anything of the sort and walked off.  I have never been treated with such poor service and will not be back.  There was no team work in the staff and that was apparent as they were tripping over each other and dishes/glasses fell nonstop.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"A friend and I came in at around 6:35 on a Monday night. The restaurant is small but cozy. As we walked in a man-who might have been the manager- was doing some work in the open kitchen area. He pointed my friend and I to a table and said someone would be with us soon. I thought this was a good sign of the experience we were going to have at this place-but I was so wrong. At 6:45 a waitress with bleach blonde hair and a Santa hat approached the table-and asked if we were ready to order. She did not acknowledge the fact that we had been waiting for 10 minutes, no apology or anything. I decided to brush it off and my friend and ordered two waters with lemon, 8 piece hot wings and a pizza. 15 minutes later-at 7:00 pm our waters came. Mind you the restaurant was very quiet on this Monday. Again, I tried to brush it off-I was really  trying to give this place a chance. Then I noticed we had no straws. This bleach blonde girl in the Santa hat was nowhere to be found. 5 minutes pass and I see her bringing a check to a table next to mine and I said: Excuse me, can I get two straws? She brings me two straws and scoffs as if it was such an inconvenience for her to do the basics of her job. 10 minutes after the straw incident our wings arrive. Y friend and I were a bit more relieved since they looked so good! This time a young brunette brought out the wings (the bleach blonde Santa hat girl was MIA). She placed the plate of wings between my friend and I and said enjoy and was about to walk away. I stopped her and said: plates would be really helpful. Thank you! And she giggled and said sure. She comes back and brings two white plates in front of my friend and I. We both look down and see actually dried crusty food on both of our plates. And my friends plate was sticky! My friend said: Excuse me this plate is dirty. And the young waitress said ""Oh, I'm sorry let me get another."" I then pointed her attention to mine as well. I then said: ""I'm sorry but we can't eat here. It took us 15 minutes to get waters. The girl in the Santa hat seems bothered by her basic job duties and now these plates are dirty. We have to go."" So then we got up and left. As I was walking out I saw bleach blonde Santa hat girl approach the table to speak to the other waitress. I could have stayed to discussed what happened but I did not see a resolution.   When folks dine out they don't go simply for the food. They go for the experience. And it's clear that this place does not care about their customers or for their safety. I plan on filling a report with the department of public health to visit this place. My whole experienced sucked. But nobody should be eating off dirty plates.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in all of New Orleans.  An Asian/Latin/Cajun/Creole fusion spot, in an unassuming part of lower Mid-City.    It's a fairly small restaurant, with some back courtyard seating, a long bar, and a few tables inside.  The grill and line are visible from the bar, which always makes for a show.    Some of my favorite menu items:  Lemongrass chicken tacos (can order just a single, or 2 or 3!)  Tater tots!!!! Hot sausage  Italian beef Dr. Tan burger Chopped salad.... I could go on!   Great spot to grab a beer, watch the game, grab a quick lunch, or a date night dinner.  Mellow atmosphere, and the service is always friendly.

Miel Pattisserie on 17th and walnut has a croque madame that will put this place out of business. I went in for the soup and they gave me their tomato bisque. That was okay but not what I ordered.

"I've wanted to try When Eddie Met Salad for a long time and finally made myself go. It was a great decision and I wish I'd done it sooner! The restaurant was quiet and a TV played softly in the background and it was a very peaceful salad experience.  For starters, I wanted to try one of their specialty classic salads. I was debating whether to go for the buffalo chicken or the California roll salad. I opted for the California roll salad as sushi always sounds great and I was reasonably pleased with my decision. The salad consisted of romaine lettuce, crab pieces, cucumber, avocado slices, wasabi peas, and either avocado ranch or wasabi dressing. I liked the salad, but I could have done without so much wasabi flavor as it became a little overwhelming at times. The combination of everything else worked great, though. Salads come in two sizes, either a small for $6.99 or a regular for $7.99. I ordered the regular and it was a good amount. If you're not incredibly hungry, I'd probably stay with the small. When Eddie Met Salad also offers wraps, soups, sides, and desserts. You can also create your own salad with ingredients and dressing.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Very disappointed. I have been in the food and beverage industry for ten years and managed independent restaurants, banquet operations and hotel restaurants.   Allow me to paint the picture for you of my experience on Saturday morning at 10am. My boyfriend and I walk into the restaurant to be greeted three different times by different servers since there was no hostess. As we wait for our table (understandable that there is a wait- brand new restaurant and it's Saturday morning) I notice that a booth with two women receive their food disappointed that it took too long and asked for a box to go. We get sat and order two coffees, a milk and two waters. The coffee and milk arrive. The waters took 10 minutes to make it to our table. I ordered the pancake combo (extremely excited to test out the sweet potato pancakes) and my boyfriend orders the steak and eggs. Thirty minutes into waiting for our order to arrive, I notice that a table of three guys who were in the restaurant before us still haven't received their order. That's when I begin to question what is happening in the back of the house (even though I can see that there are only two cooks in their open kitchen). I then overhear the blonde waitress behind the bar (I'm assuming she is chick one of two) telling a guest that her order was being made now because the printer keeps going offline and orders are not going through to the kitchen. Our waitress happens to come over and I ask if our order is almost ready because I have to be somewhere. She said we were next in line, she would go check and if I would like it boxed up. She comes back and says it would be another ten minutes so I tell her were leaving. At this point, the blonde owner behind the bar is aware of what just happened... She just lost two customers. Neither her nor the waitress made an attempt to recover what just happened. No apology or explanation or even an invitation back once they work out the kinks.  I am not here to bash a new restaurant with an adorable vibe and farm to table focus serving our local vendors. Every new restaurant has kinks to work out. What I am going to bash is the poor service recovery and lack of customer service that should be at the forefront of a new business to ensure guests come back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"In all, I expected this place to be a little better than what it was. But I know they just opened so I'm really hoping it improves because it has a lot of potential!   First, the space is very nice and they have tons of outdoor seating. Their courtyard and porch is wonderful.   We got two cocktails. I got the cucumber one (can't remember the name) and it was very good! Really liked their drinks.   The appetizer options leave something to be desired. We ended up getting the onion rings which were fried great but were pretty spicy (and this is coming from someone who loves spice). The dip they came with was also extremely spicy and vinegary which I didn't like.   Speaking of sauces, all their sauces were disappointing and didn't really match the flavor profile of what you're eating. Most had a very vinegary taste. We also got the fried seafood plates and they served it with a vinegary green sauce which was just awful. Honestly wish they just had the basic tartar and cocktail sauce.   The fried seafood was hit or miss. I will say the shrimp were VERY good and VERY fresh. Reminded me a lot of how my mom cooked them. And they had that sweet taste that I've only ever eaten from fresh Louisiana shrimp. The catfish wasn't as great. Very muddy and kind of soggy. seems like there wasn't enough breading or it wasn't fried long enough. I didn't eat my filet.   Their options for sides were also disappointing. Your entrees don't come with sides. And It was weird to me that they had fried seafood without French fries. We ended up getting the cheddar biscuits which were pretty good, but just wished there were more options besides slaw, cucumbers and potato salad.   It's also a bit pricy for what you get in my opinion. but kinda expected that given these are the owners of Margies.   I'm interested to try their boiled seafood next time and hoping that with time they'll improve!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The charges never debited until three weeks later and, of course, we no longer have the receipts but there's no way we would have left tips that large for marginal quality food and service.  There are multiple charges over three days that are simply not possible, so it's a trip to the bank to dispute this.

"Today 12-03-21 I took my daughter to her favorite pizza place. She didn't like one if her cheese slices because she said it tasted old and I told her I would get her another slice. I went up to asked for one and the guy put it in to heat up. Then he took out another fresh pizza. I asked can I have a piece of that one instead? He rolled his eyes at me. And I asked him ""Are you rolling your eyes at me?"" He ignored me. His General manager was right there and I asked him are you going to say anything or apologize. He said no he didn't see him roll his eyes with lots of attitude. And then he said fine I will talk to him later. The eye roller came over and said if I rolled my eyes I'm sorry. NO! NOT ACCEPTED SINCE HIS APOLOGY WAS WITH ATTITUDE.  I was not even trying to get a refund on the first piece. I was just going to order another. I hate asking for refunds on food so I never do. Keep in mind this was the general manager and the team lead behaving this way. I am in the business of customer service and sales. I would never tolerate anyone treating a client/customer like that.

"Great service and wonderful food!   Escargot: It tasted great. My only complaint would be that it had a bit too much bacon. Still delicious though!  Duck Confit: It was incredibly hearty. I loved the sweetness of the caramelized onions against the bitter greens. I also liked that the greens weren't cooked down too much. They added a crunchy texture to the dish that was definitely needed.   I don't remember what the last dish was called, but it was a pasta dish with crab meat. It was very rich but delightful. (I only had a taste.)  Rather than an actual desert, we got The Raven cocktail. I am definitely not a fan of bourbon. But this drink, it was just amazing!

"I'll start this out by saying the food here is nothing shy of amazing. And that's having had experienced the absurdity of Taco Tuesday on three separate occasions. The Mexican oysters are unparalleled to anywhere else in the New Orleans metro, and tacos are never disappointing.   Baja Nola's logistics need some serious improvement, though. On two of the three visits I've witnessed some patrons experiencing extensively long wait times for to-go orders. One poor guy had a 1.5 hour long ticket for six tacos. Yikes. Many times bar patrons were not promptly greeted by even the most liberal definition of the word.   I maintain the 4 star rating based upon the fact that food has ALWAYS been fantastic, even amid the chaos. I attribute the hiccups to temporary lapses due to the large crowd.   Side note: Please do away with the 7 member band on Taco Tuesday. It is WAY too many people for the size of the restaurant. 4 people is just enough.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I had the egg, bacon, gruyere breakfast sandwich that came with breakfast potatoes and my other half had the tri-fecta breakfast with a Belgian waffle, bacon, and scrambled eggs. We shared a single carrot cake pancake. The waffle was really tasty, crispy outside-fluffy inside. The pancake was also really good, not over the top sweet like I was expecting. If you're a carrot cake fan I recommend it.   The rest of our meals were ok overall. Everything else on our plates was pretty salty for our preferences. For a big franchise....

This is really a rude practice and I can count only two local restaurants who do  not do this--thank you.  Josephine please don't--great place, great food and ambiance, but add this bit of class to the eating experience.  It really does make a difference.  And contrary to what the restaurant industry here believes  (and I have had this told to me)  NY restaurants do not do this at high end places! Food--pappardelle and steak frites were wonderful and they must have fixed that salt problem because the pasta was incredible.

FOOD/SERVICE: The food was very tasty! They accommodated our group of 6 easily. We had the AYCE dinner. Their rule is that your party orders 3 meats the first round, then 2 meats for each following round afterwards. I think they do this to ensure that you finish your meats before ordering more. There is a 2 hour limit on AYCE. It was amazing. I highly recommend the thinly sliced brisket, flank, and la galbi. Spicy pork belly & spicy squid tasted okay.

Chalk it up to the summer tourist crowd. I was one of those tourists.   My husband just had to have gumbo. (Which he liked btw) Since we were late getting into town, we figured that this place would not rush us. They didn't. The waitress was great. She had to ask us to move to accommodate a group and checked in with us regularly to make sure the food was good.   I got a shrimp poor boy. I think my expectations were too high. The bread was lofty and super crusty, but not like toasted. I did not want to smash it down because it was making a huge mess just with the minimal handling I was doing checking it out.  I ended up eating everything but the bread. I think the bread is supposed to enhance the poor boy, but this bread fell flat for me.   We also had boudin balls which I highly recommend. I can't tell you if they were that good or I was just that hungry though. I've never eaten them before so I have nothing to compare them against.   I was also surprised that they were out of Abita on draft. It was the middle of the week and Abita is a Louisiana beer. So, what the heck? I had a NOLA something or another and it was okay.

"I'm pretty deep into 'Chef's Table' on Netflix. It's a fascinating show featuring various top chefs from around the world. Each episode highlights a particular chef and examines his/her cooking process & career. The autobiographical narrative style allows the chefs to talk about their background, philosophy and whatever else they're into. And the gorgeous close ups of the finished dishes are definitely high end food porn. But seriously, if I hear one more splashy, pompous, verbal vomit like ""It's not just a meal, it's a dining experience"" or ""I don't serve food, I serve a story"", I'm going to grab a dull rusty serving spoon and ram it into each of my ear holes. I just can't take it anymore! After a while all this Michelin Star hoity-toity waxing poetic about frying some dough and using tweezers to arrange flower petals on a hand chiseled slab of slate that is supposed to resemble a plate makes me want to stab these people's throats with the dry bones of dying animals in the drought-stricken regions of the world where white pressed linen napkins, the different variations of garden grown chard, and all the newest developments in molecular gastronomy isn't the most pressing topic of the day. Snapping back into reality obviously isn't an option for these folks so sadly death may be the only solution. Holy Jesus please save them. I like and appreciate food and the vast spectrum of the culinary arts but holy effing ess man, some people need to purchase a big hefty crowbar and pry out whatever boulder of self-importance is burrowed up their rectum.  Chef Ma's is not a ""dining experience""; it's an old Taco Bell (or maybe Pizza Hut?) turned into a Chinese dine-in/take-out joint. There are only a few tables and the drinks are self-serve. The server isn't super polite nor pretends to be your new best friend. There is no ""story"" being served; the story is hung up on the wall if you want to read it: Chef Ma is somehow someway connected to the Iron Chef TV show and now he's running this low key spot in Overland, MO because that's real life: It's not glamorous. You grind everyday and you're lucky if you get to do what you love. The prices are normal people pricing and the food is served on normal plates and bowls, not in bird nests and on metamorphic rock formations like some of those stupid Michelin star restaurants. But don't let the unflattering exterior fool you. The food is truly satisfying. The flavors are definitely gourmet and not the ordinary soy sauce and corn starch goop over suspect meat we've come to expect and enjoy from the average Chinese take-out. You can tell Chef Ma actually has the training and experience to be cooking at a ritzy Vegas hotel. The Salt & Pepper Calamari is so good; I don't know how he gets the batter to stay that crispy while keeping it light and airy. Short ribs were a bit too salty but still delicious and tender. The Sichuan Beef Stew Noodles were excellent too. Definitely high level cooking minus the pretension. Next time I really want to try the Spicy Chicken and the Hong Kong Style Noodles. Those dishes look awesome.   The food here isn't trying to change the course of human history nor trying to impress the 3-piece suit wearing food critics or anythings close to that. It's just serving up really well done Chinese food and perhaps trying to introduce a bit of authenticity and happiness to this Budweiser drinking, White Castle gorging, Donald Trump supporting, slightly ill-bred part of the county. For his efforts in fighting this good fight, Chef Ma certainly deserves recognition and is worthy of a docuseries episode. In fact, I think he should run for President because he has some reality TV experience too.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Visited the restaurant shortly after they opened for dinner on a weeknight.  The staff was friendly, but not incredibly attentive.  Before I get into everything else we ate, I want to say that I wish I could give this restaurant more stars because THEIR MEATBALLS ARE AMAZING.  We had them as a side and O M G.  I won't mention it again, but I would come back here just for the meatballs.  Caprese salad to start, which did not have basil.  I found that incredibly odd as I have never had a caprese without basil, but upon inspection, it was not listed as an ingredient on the menu, so my bad.  Otherwise, it tasted just fine.  Wife had the prawn and ravioli special, it was a mess of cream sauce.  Apparently there were supposed to be 2 types of sauces on the plate, but we couldn't tell the difference, the sauce was just not very good, and the prawns were incredibly overcooked.  I had plain old cheese raviolis.  They were fine and they had enough filling.  The sauce was just average.  We finished with tiramisu and they did produce a rather decent tiramisu, so I can't fault them there.  Overall, aside from the meatballs, it was just nothing special and not worth the price (except for the meatballs, which are $3.50 for 2... JUST COME HERE FOR THE MEATBALLS).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Originally from the west side of Indianapolis I'm familiar with Jordan's Fish & Chicken.  Very happy to see they have a few south side locations now!  I stopped in around 3 p.m. to place a to-go order. There was only one person in front of me, so I had my food within 15 minutes like promised. The gentleman who took my order (possibly the owner, as he was sitting off to the side in what looked like a meeting) was very nice! He asked if I'd been into the store, gave me a menu and asked if I had questions.  Establishment isn't very big inside. Just a few tables for seating so I wouldn't plan on sitting down as a family to eat here. They also do not have a public bathroom.  I ordered a 3 piece perch and wing meal. Pretty good amount of food for what you pay. Let's just say you can't completely close the to-go container because its so full. I'd recommend asking for your fish ""well done"" if you prefer a crispier fish. There was no problem with mine but I just prefer my fish cooked harder than what their usual is. Wings were good and they have amazing fries! LEMON PEPPER seasoning is a MUST! Beware, the hot sauce is ""hot"".  Overall, the establishment was clean. Fridge was stocked with a variety of bottled soft drinks and juices. They also offer the fancy pop machine that has tons of flavors.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Finally when my husband decided to order via the yelp app (or it could have been another delivery service app...I don't exactly recall) when he went to pick up, the person behind the counter yelled at him about how yelp, and other delivery options online except for their own website take 20% and from now on we should only order via their website. Ummm....how is this our problem or fault? As a business owner myself that's the cost of doing business. Again their food is good but I will never go back considering how rude the staff was. Also who yells at a customer for trying to give them business? And for the record, pick up your phone so people can make a order and not have to go through your own website.

"This coffee house and sandwich is a hidden gem of Lawrence. Their sandwiches are FIRE. The Vonnegut, Dante, Sun Also Rises, The Awakening, and Poe are favorites but seriously all their food has been stellar. Plus, you can buy their focaccia bread for four dollars if you see it out on the counter when you go to pick up your food. They also have regular and the sweet and spicy Broad Ripple chips - make sure to ask if they still have the sweet and spicy chips left if you've never had them before. Amazing. They also have a great selection of craft beers, delicious breakfast pastries including amazing biscotti and scones. I had the Apple chai-der last weekend and it was a delicious fall drink.

"To be honest with you I am a fan of this organization. Bru burger Charbonos and Stonecreek are owned by the same management. All these locations have great food, BUT because this place is at a busy location the pricing is a little high. Otherwise the quality of food is pretty good. My suggestion would be to not get fancy with your burger. Just get something that you are used to or recognize on the menu, as opposed to reinventing the wheel and getting something you have never ordered before. If you do that, you just might be teeny tiny bit disappointed. For alcohol lovers, they tell you what wine would go well with what burger.

"Came here about 4pm on a Sunday. The bar seats (no more than 20 seats) were almost completely full. There are 4 booths that seat 4 to 6 people and 3 picnic tables inside. The place has at least 12 Tv's including one in each of the 4 booths. The place has a very cool industrial feel to it.  The waitress acted put out when we asked her questions about the beers on draft and the size of the pizzas. She also said that small draft beers were $5. Other yelp reviews have said they were $4 during happy hour. After we ordered our beers they sat on the bar for several minutes before she picked them up and brought them to our table.  Our food arrived in a timely manner and the nachos were covered in fake cheese and very little else. The taste was just ok at best which was disappointing. I will say the pizza was very good!  We also couldn't help but notice a door in the background repeatedly slamming and quite a few flies.   Not the best experience and we probably will not be back. Too many other good options in the area. It seems like a great college student hangout, but not much else.

"sounds like i'm one of the only people who wasn't too impressed with this place... the sausage was only ok, and i felt the roll was much too big and hard to make it for easy eating. it was just hard to eat, it would really help if the roll was softer or they split the sausage down the middle. i got the mediterranean and i expected tons of flavor, but just didn't get it. the sausage itself was fresh enough, but it was lacking in flavoring, and the topping was also surprisingly bland. and the hummus that was supposed to be on it? practically non-existent. i had higher expectations, and should have lowered them so as not to get disappointed. so much potential, but to me, it seems to be more hype. you do get a fairly big sandwich, so as far as value, it's pretty good. but i've had much better sausage sandwiches.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

We waited nearly an hour after we sat down for our food to arrive and we had to go track down our server to get an update, she never once came to check on us after we placed our order.   When we asked to speak with a manager, we were treated as though being upset about a near hour wait was completely unreasonable. In fact, as we complained, the assistant manager told my friend, ""Let me stop you right there. I checked your ticket and your food took 45 minutes and not an hour."" While I appreciate her validating the fact that our food took nearly an hour, I'm confused about how she thinks 45 minutes is an acceptable ticket time.   In the end we were offered 10% off. That amounted to less than $3. When it came time to run our tickets, she ran our cards without the discount and we had to have them ran again.

When I brought the attention that I should have had to the waitress she had to go look it up on the menu if it includes pepperoni... Duh pepperoni pizza should come with pepperoni .  They took it back and after 5 mins. They bought 3 slices of cooked pepperoni ripped in half to accompany the pie in which they tossed it on top meanwhile the pizza sat getting cold while they did this.

It took about ten minutes for me to place my order as the cashier juggled between the phone, the register line and delivery/togo orders. Her pace was steady but not exactly efficient. I ordered the wing combo with fruit tea. It took about twenty five minutes to get my order which is about par for the course at a cook to order place.   The wings were a little greasy and inconsistently spiced. One was mild, but the other two were noticeably hotter. They were well seasoned but nothing extraordinary or unusual. In fact,I am sure I could reproduce the flavor at home because it was largely cayenne and salt. The potato salad was store bought and tasted like Kroger brand, which is not a bad thing but is not what I expected. It was not doctored up in any way, straight from the store container.   Overall, my visit was ordinary except for the fruit tea. It was especially delicious. It was sweet but well balanced and very satisfying.

"Price: reasonable compared to other nearby Asian restaurants such as Han dynasty. Getting one main entree + tax and tip will land you around the 11-15 dollar range.  Food quantity/quality: If you are looking to satisfy a noodle soup craving, I highly recommend substituting out the egg noodles (written for most of their soups) for shangdon ramen (*not what you think of typical ramen but rather similar to flat thin noodles).  The shangdon ramen has a more smooth and filling taste compared to the egg noodles which have a more stringy texture in my opinion. If you want to make sure to be full, extra noodles for additional $2 will do it! I personally enjoy the braised beef noodle soup the best.  In terms of quality regarding the soups, it's average in terms of taste and can vary time to time with it being watered down on ocassion. No worries when you have sriracha sauce or hot oil to add some kick!  I also recommend their stir fried Dou Miao vegetable dish which translated is pea shoots, full with flavor in every bite.

A professional kitchen allowing food out the door of that inferior is an insult to the patrons. I sent it back and after another 20 minutes a second sandwich arrived albeit better still partially burnt. I think the oil in the fryer was too hot or dirty. But whatever the cause after two hours at this restaurant we left, I without having eaten. Fortunately the rest of my party were able to get something acceptable.  The manager did apologize.

Both meals gave a very generous amount of meat and the smoked salmon was one of the best I've had. I also tried the creme brûlée latte, which was ok, but a bit too sweet for my liking. I preferred their cappuccino better. Our friend got the kitchen sink and I'm pretty sure it could have fed all four of us, it was massive!

"Lunch special was a great price for a good portion of pulled pork, Mac and cheese and green beans with a hunk of cornbread ($10). I had their Paloma cocktail which was very refreshing after walking around town in the blazing sun. I also added a 4oz scoop of baked beans which were definitely the highlight of the meal. Sweet, smokey and a little kick of heat.  I would've given the food 5 stars but the majority of meat I was given turned out to be a big blob of fat which was hidden by the cornbread- insert sad face here  So what I got for actual pork was very little.  What I did get was good especially after dunking it in the mustard base bbq sauce. The green beans were very salty and a bit mushy but thankfully the Mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. I'd give it another try if we're ever in the area again and maybe just pick and choose what I want (lots of those beans and Mac and cheese) instead of going for a lunch special.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"China House seriously went up and beyond our expectations (maybe because we didn't have any) and filled us with good sushi and decent Chinese food.  With that said, we ordered:  - two Hot and Sour Soups - House Special Chow Fun - Dynamite Roll - Sweetheart Roll - Kani Roll (Kani Roll was free because when you buy two special rolls, you get one regular roll FOR FREE!)  The soups were good, but not  great.  There were, however, wonton chips and duck sauce which accompanied that, so.  And the chow fun was delicious - definitely better than those oily ones at the other Chinese take-out places.  Onto the important part... the sushi.  I know this may seem weird because the place is after all Chinese, but the sushi was one of the better ones we've had up here in Jersey to date.  You don't know how disappointed we have been countless of times with sushi up here (Oh Yoko, in particular) that China House rounds up as one of our go-to's when we crave for sushi (besides Sakana).  To go into detail:  DYNAMITE ROLL:  spicy tuna and yellowtail topped with sweet kani and tempura crisps - nom nom nom.  SWEEHEART ROLL:  crabmeat, shrimp tempura, cucumber and topped with sweet shrimp, smoked salmon, and avocado drizzled with eel sauce - YUM.  SWEET KANI ROLL:  sweet kani (basically krabmeat salad) - eh.  Few people would expect such decent sushi and food from a Chinese place especially within a shady plaza strip and few would expect such when there was practically no one dining (there were a lot of take-out orders though).

"We timed a sunset dinner on the outdoor seating of the Water Works.  Given the dim lighting on the patio, my advice would be to go a little earlier so that you can enjoy the sun on the water and catch the lights of Boathouse Row towards the end of your meal. Also, a note that the patio is fairly sloped, which can make it a little uncomfortable over a long period of time.    We did enjoy the food as well as the setting.  The Grilled Haloumi was a little salty between the cheese and the pesto, but overall had a nice, strong flavor.  I LOVED my Grand Marnier Duck Breast (maybe one of the best duck preparations I've had in Philly), but thought the Herb Encrusted Scottish Salmon was too salty with the layer of pesto-y cheese (but once you peel back that layer, it's pretty good).  For dessert, we ordered the Warm Peach Purse, which was disappointing as it was slightly overcooked and had very few peaches in it.  We also were a little disappointed that we didn't get a candle in the dessert after we had mentioned this in our Open Table reservation and also had been wished Happy Birthday by the hostess upon arrival.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Then another long wait to get the bill, another long wait to pay it, and then we realized that they had given us the wrong bill. More  waiting to get this error fixed.

"Fell way way below expectation !! First time was good, second time was horrible. Needs lot of small changes & improvements..  Staff NEEDS to do dress better ! Saw cooks and servers walking around in their plaid pajamas and flip flops, not shaven !!! That is such a poor first impression !  Should hire someone who can speak good English and not shake their heads so much !!! (I mean the Indian head shake??? ) Please don't do that !   One guy had sweat pants and sneakers, he was ushering people in, and he seemed to be talking in good English (the American kind, with an accent) and a customer who was non-indian asked if they serve Naans and Vegetable Korma and he said ""Yes we serve everything"" and he asked one of the servers at the register if they serve Vegetable Korma but the server at the register just could not understand him and asked him to repeat it 3 times and finally was able to understand the guy and did the Indian head nod again !!!   When they took our order, the first guy who took the order left and someone else came by and asked if we wanted to order coffee or tea - we had just placed our lunch order ! Who drinks coffee and tea before an Indian lunch ? Maybe some people do, but we don't get asked if we want coffee or tea, we get asked ""what do we want to drink?""   For the ambience and all the talk about the wonderful food they serve, nice looking website and pictures and all that write up about how authentic their food is, their method of cooking and all that talk about nizams and royals, I felt it was a big let down.  This sealed it - When our food came, it was cold. The biriyani looked and smelled great but as soon as we served it on our plates from the extra small plates that comes heaped with the biriyani - it was cold in the middle of the dish and the piece of chicken was ice cold ! Huge Let down no. 2. There was a spoon and a fork but no knife.   And oh, just for laughs, they have a painting of ""Buddha / Mahaveer Jain"" at the entrance - just thought it was funny that we are all killing animals and eating and Buddha promoted ""Ahimsa"" , he was a vegetarian. And the music he had on was soooooo bad ...   Your goal should be ""How am I different from the other Indian restaurants in the area that have been serving good Indian food for years already"" and ""How can I make a good first impression on people""  You have the location, the ambience, the cool website and the owner who gave up his IT career to open this place - to your advantage !

But I always have a backup plan and was happy to be able to squeeze Domenica into the schedule.   The whole roasted cauliflower was good, but the whipped feta it came with was the winner. We were smearing that on our table bread. And eating it with a spoon.   The tutto carne pizza was very good, and I also enjoyed the clam and prosciutto ones.

We used call-ahead seating and still waited over 20 minutes to get a table. The apps we ordered came out at rapid speed and tasted fine. Then we waited...and waited...and waited. It was another hour and 15 minutes until we saw our burgers.  I wish  the problems ended there. My Mother's ""well done"" burger came out, still BLEEDING! My turkey burger and my husband's Kobe Beef burger came out ice cold. The bacon on mine was fatty and rubbery and my husband's was missing all together.  We had to send back two out of three, along with my bacon to be re-cooked. This also took forever.  The fries were cold and greasy.

Waited patiently for the drinks and while waiting couldn't help but notice the staff talking to each other behind the bar, server outside sitting in the outdoor patio and I would say 15 minutes went by before we were able to ask our server where our drinks were, turns out the bartender didn't see the ticket which is a simple mistake and totally fine if the restaurant was busy but like I said before we were the only table there. Maybe a couple people at the bar but they had drinks already so didn't make sense. Then it took the bartender such a long time to make our drinks and my boyfriends drink was 90% ice. All to say it was a pretty annoying experience and the food wasn't so good that we'd ever want to come back!! Also none of the staff was wearing masks.

I thought we would fall through them any minute. Our server was not welcoming at all. Didn't say her name, didn't describe menu just asked if we was ready to order. After she took our order she didn't return for the longest time. Another server brought our first course, another server cleared it, another server remarked us, another server brought our main course. After about 10 mins in to our main course did she appear and do a ""drive by"" check in on us. At the end she showed up to clear and took my drink away too when their was some left in it.  We wanted dessert but decided to go somewhere else and we didn't want to deal with her anymore. When I made the reservation I mentioned it was my husbands bday ( now I didn't expect a song & dance ) but a nice happy birthday would of been nice.

Luckily, we were passing through and wanted to stop by, and did not make a special trip--- because we came on a Sunday and they were closed.  Finally, I was able to visit on a Saturday.  I walked inside and was not greeted or anything.  So, I walked up to the bakery counter and stood there for almost fifteen minutes, while the seated customers stared at me.  The staff never appeared and never I ended up walking out after a long wait, just shaking my head in disbelief at the terrible service. I guess they do not need business?  I was specially looking for house-made Ube Cakes (purple yam, often called Taro).  This is due to the fact that Mercel's website promotes their bakery and custom cakes, one of the flavors being Ube.

They failed to remove the bones from some of the cuts, which is quite a fail.   Other than that, the food is good and what you would expect from the average decent Chinese restaurant. The eggplant is tasty, their water spinach and bok choy is good. Their pork and egg porridge is flavorful.

"My girlfriend and I love going to the food spots in Midtown. Supporting local businesses is always a great idea, especially when they deserve being recognized. Now about this place...  I'll start with the negatives. We walked in for Sunday lunch around 12:30 and it was pretty busy and with that comes a wait. No biggie for us, we don't mind waiting if we really want to try something, but man was that waiting area cramped. Barely any room there if more than 5 people are waiting and there was more than that when we were there. We also didn't know that the bar/counter was open seating. Would be nice if we were informed by the host. Took about 30 mins to get seated, again no biggie, but at this point we're pretty hungry, its 1pm, and they close in an hour. So we were hoping for a quick service and get our food at a timely manner, boy were we wrong. We noticed that no one around our table even had any food in front of them, so not really a good sign. We were given waters fairly quick after being seated which was good, but I didn't realized I'd be sipping my water for 45 mins before getting my food. I even noticed this table across from us that's been there way before us getting restless looking around and at the servers. And when they finally got there food it was just sandwich plates??? Are you kidding, I'm going to assume they've been waiting as much as us but for what, sandwiches? I'd rather go to SÜP across the street for that if I knew I'd be waiting that long.  I understand that waiting is part of eating out, I mean if you don't want to wait, make your own food at home. And my girlfriend and I are usually considarate ,more than most I'd say, to workers in the food Ind. because we've been there and done that. I just don't see any justification for an hour and 15 mins wait.  Now the food (which are the positives, at least at the time when we went). I ordered the pork chop and eggs with regular fries, while my girlfriend ordered the French toast combo. When I finally got my plate, I was surprised at the portion of meat that they actually give, it wasn't big but it was a thick cut. My pork chop was very juicy and it was cooked how I like it, juicy and soft haha. I'm no chef or food genius but I liked how it was seasoned and cooked. The fries, well they're fries, pretty hard to get them wrong. I kind of wish I got the sweet potato fries though since that's what most people are raving about (wish it was recommended to us). My girl also loved her French toast. They were ""fluffy"" and looked really appetizing. It wasn't overly sweet off the bat either and the syrup just brings up that level slightly to make them perfect. The portions? Well this is Midtown, ruled by healthy everything so don't expect to pig out, but you'll definitely leave satisfied....after you forget the fact you waited so long for your food.  Would we go back? Maybe, but I sure hope their food quality hasn't declined or else I don't see this place lasting. I'll give 3 stars for the good food, and 2 stars off for the really slow service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"We went here with our 7 and 9 year old boys (steak fans) 9/13/19.   I had a royal sazarac, followed by a filet and Mac&cheese, boys split a filet and fries, and momma had a sangria followed by a ravioli of lobster and buratta.     For dessert, mom and the youngest split a chocolate cake, and I split a bananas foster with the oldest son.    Our server John was awesome (seriously, someone needs to give him a pat on the back and a raise, he is a first class host!).  We were taken care of in superb fashion, and wanted for nothing.  The food was sublime, and my wife was very happy that ""this sangria is NOT watered down"".     John allowed our boys to ""help"" prepare the bananas foster, which was a huge hit, and really made their day, as well as some of the other patrons who enjoyed the spectacle.     A true class act, and yet another outstanding restaurant in a city full of amazing restaurants.

"First time at the restaurant.  The decor gives it a cool California vibe. My wife and I ordered tacos given it is National Taco Day.  The food was okay, but I was expecting better.  The tuna tacos were light on the tuna and the fish was way over cooked for sushi grade.  The fish (Mahi-mahi) tacos my wife order were decent, but light on the fish as well.  Sorry to say, but I have had street tacos that were much tastier.  I forgot to mention, I was charged $5 for chips and salsa which is fine, but if you are going to charge, make sure the chips are fresh which these were clearly not.

"I remember this place being much better when I went a few years ago. I was very disappointed this time. I ended up getting the mixed grilled plate and the meat was very dry so it wasn't that tasty. I did enjoy the rice but I had to add a lot of sauce to the dish because the meat was quite dry. My wife felt the same way with her lamb wrap. Just a heads up, the fries are a bit more on the soggy side which I don't mind but I know a lot of people prefer them crunchy.

Just ordered dinner from here about 20 minutes ago. I put on each food I ordered that I had an allergy to shellfish and to make sure there wasn't any cross contamination. I also called the restaurant to make sure it was enforced.... here I an 20 minutes later swollen. The food was tasty but it was evident there had been some cross contact. When I called to verify none of my food would come in contact with any shellfish I was told it wouldn't..... very upset. I would have changed my order accordingly if certain items were at risk of cross contamination.  So I spent $25 and now can't eat any of it.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Meh...Nice if you want to have a warm doughnut and a cup of joe, but I'm not overly impressed by a bunch of glazes and toppings all served on the same doughnut.  I'd rather have a filled doughnut, and prefer Krispy Kreme or Suzy Jo's to FPD or Duck Donuts, which are the same as far as I'm concerned.  Seems like a novelty item to me, but they may do well in this location with all the local businesses nearby, and the local Dunkin' in a rather bad spot around the corner.    Similar to Duck Donuts, they make fresh donuts, then dip them in glazes and toppings.  The many varieties(over 150,000 apparently) are lost on me as I just want chocolate.  I don't even want the chocolate they have at FPD, I want chocolate icing, not glaze or jimmies, or chocolate chips.  So many combinations I want nothing to do with...I tried the maple bacon and found it absolutely revolting.  The doughnut itself was great once I got rid of the bacon.  Staff was nice and my doughnuts were fresh made and stayed warm for about 20 minutes on the drive to work.

"I'd give it 3.5 stars but there are no half stars as we all know. I'll leave that to someone generous who will round up their rating so the overall stars will average out. Anyways, I liked their bánh mì, ordered the regular one, although the meat were not much(one slice each of the pork roll (cha lua) and two different types of ham), I am satisfied that they used the egg yolk butter! That is always a plus in my book. The bánh mì has your typical veggies and pâté and the overall taste was good.  I also tried their broken rice dish, that was a Fail for them. I've always loved Vietnamese egg quiches and every place makes them a bit different here and there. But what is always a BIG FAT NO is when black pepper overpowers the entire piece of quiche! Yep, that is what happened here! I like black pepper in other dishes but seriously it does not belong on the quiche...so sad! The pork chop was average, not too dry.

"I got the grilled chicken spurrito for lunch and it was.. good. Nothing out of this world but certainly far from bad. I like the concept a lot of mixing the burrito with the spring roll but I think it's just missing something. The sauce given with the chicken spurrito is a Vietnamese dressing which has great flavor but is very liquidy so all of the sauce ends up at the bottom of the burrito. My best bites were at the end with the sauce! I wish they offered different sauce options, something with a bit thicker of a consistency so it will actually stick to the bite you're taking. Also felt like like it needed more chicken to keep up with the amount of veggies. All in all it was a good and healthy lunch, would eat again if I had my own sauce!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I have written, re-written and then rewrote this review several times - trying not to sound like a bitter person that is hard to please.    If you are reading this - maybe I was happy enough with this review to finally publish it.    So - here was my problem : It was my birthday dinner and I chose Rock Bottom because I thought it'd be  nice to dine outside on the upstairs patio.  Little did I know that they have two menus.  One upstairs, one downstairs.  Totally different kitchens.  So, if I wanted the 'good food' - we'd have to eat downstairs.  Bummer.  So, we put our name in at the downstairs restaurant.  30 Minutes pass and we are finally ready to be seated.  Once seated - our server takes our drink orders and delivers them quickly.  Then time for our food orders.  Those who ordered salads and soup - they are delivered quickly.  So far, so good.  Then the wheels fall off.  Nearly an hour passes before our entrees are delivered.  I ordered the Sirloin Steak with Jalapeno Butter.  The steak had exactly zero flavor and zero heat.  And, not to mention - it was cold along with the onion rings and white cheddar mashed potatoes.  How could it be, I thought?  They brought it out on a cast iron skillet before plating it.  The presentation looked nice - but really?  How is this already cold?  I asked a friend who got the Mac and Cheese (and loved, by the way) was I crazy?  I had him try the steak because, to me, the texture was odd and the flavor was non-existent.  He tried too and was as confused as I was.  He agreed the texture was strange and the flavor wasn't there.  He mentioned that it might have been frozen steak.  The only time he had ever experienced that type of texture and complete lack of basic beef flavor was when he had frozen some steaks and tried to thaw and cook them later.  This was similar.  I agreed once I thought about it.  Now, whether or not this is an accurate reflection on what actually happened to my steak - I will never know.  But I will tell you it wasn't good.  If it was fresh - I have no idea what they did to make it so flavorless and bland and...odd textured.    So, I will say that the server and the manager tried to do right by me by offering me something else to eat.  But, at this point - after having waited for what, at this point, was closing in on the two hour mark - I just wanted to go.  And most of my friends were already done or close to being done - so, making them wait while a new entree is cooked and then waiting for me to eat it didn't seem like a nice thing to do.  So, I declined.    At the end of the night - the manager picked up the tab for the table, minus our drinks. That was nice, I guess.  They all seemed happy because they enjoyed their meals and didn't complain.  But, I did complain and still hadn't had anything to eat. So yes - I had no food, spent two hour there - and still had to pay for my diet coke.  I did leave a tip based upon the food I would have ordered because it wasn't the servers fault and he did try to make me happy.    If you wanted to make me happy - you could have done a couple things:  1)  Not charge me for my diet coke because, after 2 hours in your restaurant - that was all I had minus a bite of cold, flavorless and oddly textured steak.    2)  Offer to have me come back on your dime.  Offering me a quesadilla to go because it is 'fast' doesn't really solve my desire to have a nice meal on my birthday with my friends.  I ordered a steak and offering me a quesadilla to go isn't even in the same ballpark.  To me, that is like renting a luxury car and getting to the rental place and all they have is economy cars.  I realize I'm still getting a car - but it wasn't what I ordered, it wasn't how I wanted to it and doesn't come close to meeting my expectations.  So yes, rather than take something I didn't want - I left without nothing - except I was down $30 for a diet coke and a tip to the server ($10 bucks) and parking (20 bucks) because, apparently, Tom Petty was in town at Bridgestone Arena.    Will I be back?  Unlikely.  A diet coke doesn't cost me $30 at home.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We went for dinner last night on Mothers Day. Very, very disappointed. The service was beyond horrible.  The waitress seemed like she hadn't been trained AT ALL.  She never took the menus out of our way. I had to finally give them to her halfway through the meal. I had to stack up the used appetizer/ soup dishes/ wine tasting glasses and give them to her to clear as well. We ordered a bottle of wine, she brought only one glass. Then she sent another waiter over to open the bottle when we finally got it because she didn't know how. She forgot to put my husbands order in. At first she said it was over cooked and they we're starting over. Then she apologized for forgetting. The food was good, but not great. I wanted the Filet Mignon but they ran out even though it was only 630 and there were only four other tables. They did have a cheaper ""Italian"" cut steak that we were offered on the same hot rock the filet comes on. It came with the same three ""sauces"" the filet comes with. My daughter and I both had it and the steak itself was good. However I'm not sure how a little bowl of salt mixed with pepper qualifies as a sauce? Seriously.. WTH? The other ""sauces"" consisted of a  little bowl of melted butter and then one actual sauce which was the  same Marsala sauce that was on my sons Chicken Marsala.   The waitress did try making up for missing my husbands order by telling him they would comp a dessert. She didn't ask him what kind of desert he wanted, she just brought him a piece of cake in the middle of our meal. I was grateful she didn't bring him cheesecake as he loathes it. She then asked the rest of us if we wanted dessert and stood there waiting for an answer. I finally had to ask her what the choices were as the desserts weren't listed on the menu. Ironically however, we did note earlier that a Soup du Jour was --in addition to the French Onion they always have.  Before ordering we  asked what  the soup of the day was.  Our waitress said ""oh there isn't one today. Just the French Onion"" So either she was lying or someone didn't pay attention to detail when printing the special Mothers Day only menu.   Even though they sent us home with my Husbands Salmon in a to go container I still can't bring myself to give them more than one star. There were just too many fails. I especially don't understand why the experienced wait staff didn't help out the inexperienced waitress since there were only four tables full.  Unfortunately I can't see Angells succeeding  if diners come in to be served haphazard meals. What a disaster.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"This place left me so underwhelmed and unsatisfied.   I really love how they set it up and the ambiance it gives off. The music is modern and I could feel myself bopping my head to it.   On to the food. I had the Bywater eggplant, ginger scallion noodles, royal ribs, and Hawaiian fried rice. I was expecting the eggplant dish to be more flavorful after reading all of the good reviews, but I didn't taste the spice that everyone was talking about. It was good, but not great. The ginger scallion noodles had such good flavor. I could really taste the ginger in the sauce. So tasty. The royal ribs was too sweet for my liking. But it was so tender! I loved that I could just use my fork to pull the meat off instead of dirtying my fingers picking it up. Hawaiian fried rice... I was so sad. No one at my table enjoyed this. We ended up leaving over half uneaten. The rice did not taste fully cooked and would break up in my mouth. I hate hard rice. The flavor was good, but who wants to eat uncooked rice? No one.

"I've been here once for eat-in and once for takeout only for a milkshake for the take out though. First the fact that I can't receive a burger the temperature I LIKE it, is very confusing considering its a burger spot. Secondly, the cocktail I ordered first was DISGUSTING, so I complained and got another and it was passable. Never again. The side salad with my burger was so over dressed and barely even had full pieces of lettuce. But at that point I was so irritated I didn't feel like waiting for another. And third, because a man walked my food (never took my order) to my table, and brought me my gross  drink, I had to tip him? Does he receive typical server pay, or what? It should say requested 10% or requested 15% on the receipt letting the customers know. But basically he did nothing but I as a server myself didn't know how to tip considering he didn't do 1/3 of what most servers are required to do. I couldn't even tell you his name.

"Zaffron is a nice alternative to generic-fil-a, Chinese food--us, and $5-fuß long.  I love the fact that they have organic chicken both regular and spicy. I usually get a salad with chicken and because it's built to order you can pretty much do any combination that your gut feels like at that time.  It seems that they actually listen to people who review them because when I started going there the lettuce was not fresh, now they keep pre-made portions in the freezer. The portions of vegetables and feta cheese were small, now it seems that they do put more. I am actually afraid of trying their rice because I'm used to high standard Middle Eastern, Moroccan/Persian rice so I don't want to disappoint myself, not their fault though.   One suggestion about the chicken kabobs: it seems like you guys make them ahead of the lunch hour rush and it's fine but I would cover them or put them in something that keeps them warm and moist because chicken meat tends to dry out fast. I would also marinade the spicy chicken for a tad longer.  I will be coming here, time after time, their salad is a healthier alternative to the rest of the crap...I mean fast food around and cheaper than Salad Works.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Yelp lists ERA as an Ethiopian Dive Bar. I'd find this description to be on point. While I'm not stranger to dive bars, this was my first foray into Ethiopian dining. I'm impressed by both.  I recently dined in the back room with a large group of Yelpers for another fabulous UYE organized by the fabulous Sari A.   Since I've never had Ethiopian food before, I can't compare it to anything else, but I definitely enjoyed it. My husband and I went splitsies on two entrees on all of the sides. We tried the Yebeg Wat (#14) and the  ERA Special Beef Tibs (#6) with the goman, miser lentils, ye'miser wot and the atkelt wot. After typing all of that I really feel like I'm talking in a foreign language and have no idea what I'm talking about. That's kind of how I felt while eating my meal. Bottom line was that everything was extremely flavorful and extremely enjoyable. Sometimes it's more fun not trying to understand your meal and actually just eating it.   They had a nice variety of bottled and draft beers as well. Nothing eclectic but enough that you could have a light beer or a craft beer at dive bar pricing.   Speaking of pricing, recent UYEs have been BYOB so adding the bar tab element into group dining could have been a giant nightmare. Our server not only handled our large group with grace, everyone automatically received individual bills. Crisis avoided!    My only real complaint was that our food came out very staggered. Some people were totally done by the time some people even got their food. We were a large group so I'm not going to let that hamper my overall opinion. The server did a great job explaining Ethiopian cuisine to newbies such as myself and kept everything else running pretty smoothly.   I had ERA bookmarked for a long time.

I must say its still only good for 3 stars based on my dinner here this past friday night. Our server was super sweet but lacked a little basic knowledge of service ....  like bringing water to the table, sugar for coffee that type of thing. I must say the menu on paper makes sense but once you sit down things getting a little hairy. We as a table shared the gnocchi (BEST DISH ), a few people got salads and pretty much everyone ordered pasta. The Ziti was the most popular dish ordered and the overall response was that it was just OK. I opted for the linguine with crab and arugula.

"First time here. Visited on a Wednesday night before their Drag Show, got seated and waited almost 20 minutes to get served. There was only 1 server(not judging as he was trying hard). The hostess had to take our drink orders and help him out. No biggie I understood because I work in the hospitality industry and these things can happen. We ordered some appetizers and they came out quickly. I am an octopus fan and I must say their fried octopus was fishy, didn't taste like tempura and was not so good. Had to ask for some home sauce to eat it because it was dry. I think they should consider making it just grilled. Their tongue was tendered and had a sweet sauce to it which it wasn't bad but it wasn't my favorite. Flavors are kind of bland for Portuguese food. Finally I tried their Goan Patties which reminded me of guava pastry but filed with beef. I will consider giving them another try but I wasn't impressed with the food. They did offer a drink BOGO at their Speakeasy when you show your dinner receipt which was kind of nice.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"How is it possible to screw ice cream up so badly? I went back a second time, thinking that perhaps the reason for my liquid ice cream was it being mid July. But come January it's almost just as bad. Soft serve is one thing. This is another. It's an awkward stage between soft serve and milkshake. The flavors are many... but only for sno balls. Ice cream flavors.. just chocolate and vanilla. And the toppings are limited. Price and serving size is good however. The parking lot is heinous. We got trapped by some dingus who parked his truck, with boat attached to the back right in front of the place, blocking every way to leave. Outside seating is dirty and unkept. The only way this place stays in business is that it doesn't have much competition nearby, and stuff like this is in high demand when you live in the Hell of the United States.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and loved the quaint decor and intimate feel! it's BYO so we brought some wine, and shared the dishes family style on each side of the table. mediterranean is my favorite type of cuisine, so i had high hopes for the food, but sadly i was a bit disappointed. i really wanted to love it, but it seemed rather unflavorful in comparison to the other mediterranean places i've tried, and i found myself re-salting everything again on my plate...but perhaps that's just personal preference because all the other girls seemed to love it! the service, however, was top notch!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The R Bistro space is a well designed brushed chrome, brick and light colored wood.  In the main dining room there is a window into the kitchen, cunningly designed to allow a view without overwhelming the guests.  We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess for a 7:00 reservation.  We split two appetizers--the elk served over a bed of leeks and a duck confit topped with a poached egg served over a cornmeal griddlecake.  Both of the appetizers were exceptionally tasty.  The elk was delicately cooked and matched the leeks and the light sauce exceptionally well.  We've been on a duck confit rampage here lately, and this certainly made the grade--and was really perfect with the poached egg and cake.  For entrees we had a spiced port tenderloin and the grilled cobia.  The tenderloin was served on a bed of lentils with a honey-vinegar sauce.  The meat was perfectly cooked and the pairing with the lentils and honey was surprisingly tasty.   Generally I'm not enthusiastic about fish, but the cobia was a mild whitefish that was flavored well and matched perfectly with the mashed sweet potatoes and the green beans.  The highlight of that dish, though, was the red pepper and onion relish that was served on top of the sweet potatoes.  It wasn't a combination that I would have considered, but it will be a combination that I will not soon forget.  For dessert we had butternut squash stuffed crepes.  The sweet-squash had a buttery and cinnamony flavor and was a nice way to finish a sweet-potato based dish.  I liked R Bistro quite a bit and would unhesitatingly recommend it to someone visiting Indianapolis.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"This used to be a family favorite, and we continued to go there long after the quality had taken a severe dive.  If you must go there, stick to the menu or the Mongolian bbq. Avoid the buffet. The quality of the meat and seafood in the buffet is lousy and not much better in the Mongolian bbq. The shrimp are typically uncleaned and gross.    The service is really inconsistent but typically lousy. You can sit ignored for long periods. Since we've been there many times, we've had the treat of having the bus guys blame the wait staff AND the wait staff blame the bus guys.    The food is mediocre at best and sometimes just plain bad. Again, the buffet is the worst example, sitting too long and often not re-stocked. They do not refresh the buffet for the last hour or longer of the buffet period, so you may pay for a meal and then find that there's nothing much left to pick from, and what there has probably been there for awhile, cold, congealed or inedible.   IT's a shame because we enjoyed this place for a long time but can't justifty paying the price for the sadly reduced quality.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Mother in law treated us to dinner by ordering from China Kitchen tonight. Eggrolls were delicious and so were the chicken wings.  I don't usually like sweet and sour but their shrimp sweet and sour was very good and also enormous. Their hot braised chicken and General Tso's tasted too similar.

"Went in for lunch and I had the quiche lorraine. The crust was great, although the overall quiche was a little sweet-- I believe it was the onions. I finished the whole thing though, and probably could have eaten more. The half crossaint was yummy. It was really fresh and while I enjoyed it, it didn't have the flaky airiness of a great crossaint; more the chewiness of fresh bread.   My husband had the soup; the tomato soup ""cup"" was a small ramekin. The flavor was good, but again, a small portion size.  I had a chocolate crossaint for dessert and he had the french apple pie ala mode. The pie was great, the crossaint was served warm and yummy as expected, but again, not flaky like some I have had.

"Definitely real Mexican awesomeness.  This is easily the best Mexican that you can get in the Bay!!!  They make their own tortillas which really adds to everything that they have.  The food is reasonably priced and has real authentic flavor.  I love the cochinita pibil and the machete taco.  Each taco is only around $2 and has fresh meat and veges in it.  Several of the items have real Mayan flavor to it.  Try the horchata.  And their Flan is the best that I have had outside of Mexico but it does sell out on busy days.  They also do special events where they cook whole pigs, cuban pork, and a ton of other things.  Call to find out what they are going to do and when.  And the owner is the nicest guy.

Ok first timer here and disappointed. First It was my husband and I and our two kids. My husband and I got the 4 course meal including Wisconsin cheese for dipping. The cheese and dippers were good. they take it away bc there's only 1 cook top which there should be a few cooktops per table especially a family of 4. We chose the cast iron for cooking method and it took 45-50 mins to cook all four meals way longer then stated on menu. then got in trouble for turning the burner up higher. The last part with the choc was amazing and made my kids very happy. I'd have to say I won't be returning.

"We came to Meril's for my mom's birthday.  We had a group of six so we got the full tapas experience.  I think in all we ordered about 16 different plates, so we were able to try a little bit of everything on the menu.  THE GOOD: Meril's was a really cool experience.  There are very few places where I can say that I have tried almost the entire menu.  The wait staff is also very nice.  My mom wanted a dirty martini for her birthday and being a birthday diva, made a snarky (yet sweet) comment to our waitress.  Our waitress went across the street to Lucy's to get some pitted olives just for my mom.  They even brought out cotton candy after dessert for my mom's birthday, to which she replied, ""This is awesome.  I haven't had cotton candy since Mardi Gras when you were kids.""  THE BAD?:  Honestly, I wouldn't even call this bad, but when I was writing this review, I found it something that needed to be said.  Despite trying more than half of the menu, remembering the olive experience, and the cotton candy, I cannot remember a single thing that I tried that night.  Not once did I say to myself, ""WOW! This is the best thing that I have ever tasted."" It might be ok if your food isn't memorable in another city, but in New Orleans and having Emril Legasse's name attached to your restaurant, you better make sure your food is memorable.  THE UGLY... I MEAN PRETTY: This place is definitely trendy and a feast for the eyes.  Before I had even come here, my boyfriend and I were walking around the city and saw the giant crab mural.

I'm watching people come in and snagging tables as soon as it's vacated. Then others arrive and they go up front to order. I ask the hostess and she says they already ordered, which was not true. The other family in front if us noticed this also and began complaining. The finally admitted the mistake and said you are supposed to order first and then wait for a table.

The only reason I give it 2 stars is for their price deals. $2 for a sub is not bad, but honestly I wouldn't even pay that. First time I had a sub it was ok. Bread was pretty weak, tasted bland and was definitely old. Second time I ordered one for delivery during one of their $2 deals. I waited 45 min. and couldn't wait any longer because I had to go to class so I called them to cancel the order and they were very unaccommodating. They said the sandwich was about to be sent out.

We made a day of it and went to Dinosaur World which is only 2 miles away from this location.  As soon as we headed in we were greeted by the cash register attendee. I got the spaghetti with meat sauce and a chocolate cheesecake. The husband had the spaghetti with meat sauce as well. As soon as we sat down after ordering we were offered up some fresh and hot breadsticks from a basket. Another one of the great things about this chain is that it's unlimited breadsticks. They have several high chairs on site for little ones if you need it. The restaurant itself was clean and well-kept.  Both of our spaghettis were delicious and even our daughter ate a fair amount. The cheesecake was good and we shared that together. We opted for cups of water with our meals, however, they have a soda fountain and other drink options available.

Kudos to the chefs at Jakers who seemingly care about preparing nice meals.   One recent annoyance observed at Jakers is that the servers no longer carry straws. Are you kidding? This isn't California, nor should it ever be. We were told it is now policy for the servers to not carry straws with them.

"Just went here tonight for the first time. We were in for an early dinner. ( about 6pm). The place is much bigger on the inside that it looked walking up to the door. There were only 4 other people in the restaurant at the time, but we had a 2 for 1 combo plate coupon and decided to give it a try.  We sat in one of the back booths after walking across a large open area with no seats or tables in it....I guess they have a nightclub sort of thing that happens there on Fridays, and the area we walked across looked like it could have been used as a dance floor. I have big issue with ""nightclubs"" that serve food, because they are usually so damn dirty. The agave was not like that at all. It was Very clean, but it did have a bit of that  ""there has been a large dance party here"" type smell to it.  Its just strange that they do not put the tables and chairs to the front of the resturant when there is not an event happening.  So on to the important stuff... the food was ok. kinda bland for my taste. I had the chili rellano and cheese enchilada combo plate for $8.95. (This is the combo I always have to judge every Mexican food place I have ever been to) I added some salt and salsa to it and it gave it the kick I was looking for. A  few well placed onions in the kitchen would have worked just as well.   The coronas we had were $4 ea. seems like more of a nightclub price for a Mexican beer at a Mexican restaurant. $3 would be better, but I guess we had just missed the happy hour that runs from 3 to 6pm  They serve 2 for 1 margaritas and .99 bud lights. We sat down at about 5:55pm...our server did not mention the happy hour...I had to ask about it, but by then it was after 6  Other than that t he Service was fine.

"Taqueria La Pasadita is located in a building that used to be a Taco Bell. It's sort of between where I used to live when I was a young child and where my grandparents used to live before they were dead. My mom used to take me there to get tacos[1], then she'd drop me off at my grandparents' house (via ""warehousing""), and my grandfather would stand there and watch in amazement as I put down eight to ten of them in a sitting. Kids in the 1950s didn't eat the way a young Bol would eat. Even most adults today don't - and they shouldn't!  Driving through the area 20+ years later, it's clear that not a lot good has happened in the interim. This Taco Bell was one of those old school Taco Bells with the actual bell on the roof, and I notice it's since been removed. I'm not sure if the building's current owner had it removed on purpose, to make it look less like a dilapidated former Taco Bell, or if it was stolen in the night by tweakers who sold it for scrap, but let's just say I wouldn't be surprised if it were the latter.  La Pasadita back when it first opened was par for the course. The parking lot was in the worst shape I've ever seen a parking lot in - and I once ate at LC's Diner, on Page a touch west of Pennsylvania. RIP (natch). Instead of taking the old Taco Bell menu down they just wrote over it. Then there was another menu on the wall. Then there was a paper take out menu. Then there was also an actual restaurant menu (in a taqueria). And these menus all said different things! Tha fuck? The floor, tables and chairs - if you can call them that - were obviously left over from Taco Bell.  These days Taqueria La Pasadita is borderline classy, at least by Overland standards. I'm not too familiar with the area, but I doubt there's any real risk in declaring the new parking lot the very best parking lot in all of Overland, the fact that it's at a weird incline notwithstanding. The rest of the restaurant is more or less the same as it was, and they don't have heat in the winter, but what they do have is a guy who stands by the door and hands you the menu with the shit they actually serve on it.  Don't be afraid to be didactic or patronizing with this guy. He has no idea what you're talking about, and sometimes it helps if you just point to it. And for what it's worth, miscommunication is a two way street. Sometimes he repeats my order back to me, and I'm not sure what he said, but I just nod okay anyway, and I end up with something way different from what I wanted, but delicious none the less.  You can't go completely wrong at Pasadita, just kinda. If it's a torta you're wanting, I suggest you hit El Mexiquense around the corner. The tortas at Pasadita are filled with Nick Manning-sized loads of fresh ingredients, including a surprising amount of avocado, but I'm not as crazy about the bread. It looks like they put it in a panini press, and all it does is burn the outside. The queso fresco is hardly even warm, let alone melted. Just because it's called fresco doesn't mean you should eat it that way. #FAIL  Your best bet is to go with the gorditas. They look like tortillas in the shape of pita bread stuffed with taco meat, cheese and what have you and dropped in a deep fryer, from which nothing but magic could possibly emerge. They cost about one and a half times as much as a taco, but they're about four times as filling. That, my friends, is called value. On a calorie per dollar basis you'd have to buy a week's worth of Hostess snack cakes with an EBT card to get a better deal.

I stopped in because of the perfect reviews and the pictures posted here. They had the smoked Tri Tip today and it was one of the best sandwiches I have had in a while. The Tri Tip had a good smoke flavor and was shaved very thin. The pepper relish really went well with it too. The banana pudding was a bonus afterwards.

"What a find! My friend and I wandered into this place and we were so glad. After a stressful day of traveling, this quiet little place was such a relief. We sat at the bar and Jay served us there. He was awesome! He made us feel so comfortable and welcome. We had great conversation and he made biscuits and gravy for my friend, which was delicious. He gave us recommendations, made us custom drinks, and talked about his life there in New Orleans. Overall, the perfect place to pop into after a stressful day.

When in New Orleans I was told I have to try this favorite. I had beignets in California before so I had an idea of what to expect. This place specializes in beignets and gives you a hefty portion of powdered sugar with it. There was plenty of seating and this place was also fairly close to the airport in case you wanted a snack after you land or before you take off. When I arrived there was no line which was nice. The beignets comes with 3 in an order and comes out to about $1 per beignets. Unfortunately because of all the powdered sugar it is very easy to make a mess. The hot chocolate was just so so to me but come here and at least try the beignets. Service was fast and prompt.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Good food - terrible service. There was no crowd and everything took forever. Asked for hot sauce - literally waited 10 minutes before we saw a waitress (not even the server for our table) and got the hot sauce. Kiddo ordered a cheese only quesadilla and it came with spicy chicken. Wasn't going to wait forever to turn it back in so he picked the chicken out and covered it in sour cream. Same with the free drink for checking in on Yelp - not worth the 30+ minutes it will take to see out waitress again. Won't be back unless we try the take-out service.... Just worried we'll wait all night.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Unbelievably bad! Worst experience ever. Vote with your wallet and do not patronize this restaurant.  We reserved a table for eight. When we arrived we were told you will be at two different tables. We almost left but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. The three men in our group sat at one table and wives and daughters at another. After wine and starters, we ordered our entrees. One of the entrees was supposed to be split between a husband and wife at separate tables. Twenty minutes later two entrees in hot plates arrive at the men's table. Out of politeness the men wait for everyone else to be served. Fifteen minutes go by. Thirty minutes go by. After forty-five minutes the men ask for the manger. We watch our waiter tell the manager, Brian Baynes . He goes and hides in the kitchen rather than talk to us. We tell our waiter and other waiters no less than three times we want to speak to the manager. Another fifteen minutes go by. Finally one of the men literally goes into the kitchen and tells Brian we need to speak to him. He comes out and basically tells us to go to h_ll. He says "" you should have known there would be a problem when you asked for an entree to be split."" Hello? The other entrees come out now. The two entrees served one hour previous are ice cold. Brian insists it is our (the customers) fault. We tell him this is unreasonable and we don't want the food now. He again tells us to go to h_ll and a waiter brings us a check for $400. We pay the $400, give the waiter $50 in cash (whom definitely did not deserve it). and leave. We were all in shock and left hungry and angry. Look at the reviews carefully there are others with similar experiences with the current manager Brian Baynes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"We called earlier in the day to advise my girlfriend was gluten intolerant and could Kemoll's provide gluten-free dinner choices.  The response was ""Yes, we have many gluten-free menu items to choose from.""  Upon arrival were led to a back room with six tables and seated at a table that was directly next to a arge dehumidifier blowing noisily at full speed.  We asked the waitress about the gluten-free menu choices and she responded ""We really don't have that many gluten-free items on the menu."" The waitress then dashed off saying she would be right back to take our drink order.    She returned to seat people at other tables next to us and walked right by us as she left the dining area.  No drink order.  She then returned to serve a dish to folks at another table and once again walked right by us leaving, again no drink order. Then the third time she arrived back at our table where my date ordered a Hendricks and tonic with a cucumber.  The waitress advised there were not any cucumbers in the restaurant, at all.  As we enjoyed our cocktails I hailed the waitress over and ordered an appetizer.  When the waitress returned with the appetizer the only plate I had in front of me was the charger plate, no dinner plate.  I dished out a portion of the appetizer onto the charger plate.  Classy I know, but it gets better.   My date ordered the salmon with a side dish of asparagus and I ordered a house salad and a strip steak, medium rare.  When the waitress returned with my salad she places it right on top of the appetizer mess left on my charger plate. Never have I seen this done in any restaurant, ever.  I then cut into my steak and, well, it was rare, not medium rare but very rare. Plus is was cold and full of gristle. I had but a couple of bites and took the rest back home to the dogs.  While the salmon was fine it was very obvious the asparagus came from a can.  No doubt, at all.  Now for the good one.  For dessert I ordered their allegedly famous, made table side Banana's Foster.  She takes my order and returns minutes later with, are you ready for this? ""We don't have any bananas.""  I kid you not.  No cucumbers, no fresh asparagus and no bananas.  Give me a break.

"What do you want from Olive Garden, you know what I mean?  Been eating here off and on since I moved to town  7 years ago. I used to have two friends who worked here so my visits were more frequent.  Went in today for lunch. My server Nelson was... I dunno what he was. He seemed  annoyed with me, and I think if I had to surmise why it was because I was using my ipod during the whole visit. What can I say? If I'm eating alone, I want to entertain myself with something.  So by and large Nelson was perfectly fine but not outstanding.  As for the food... portion was a weird issue. I ordered the chicken parmigana which I've had many times before, and it always came with two pieces of chicken. This time it came with only one, and a much smaller portion of pasta. I would say this is because it was lunch time, but the price was the same as evening time, so...? A little odd.  Overall the visit was...fine.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Not sure if we came on an off day or what.  Not reviewing the decor because there isn't much but if a bbq place is good enough, you are just staring at the food.   The pulled pork had huge chunks of jellied fat all through it. The burned tips had huge fat chunks through it.   The predominate flavor was of salt and liquid smoke (I am not saying they use liquid smoke, just that the flavor and later, the urps, gave that bitter impression). The bread was a bit old. Hard and chewy. I know it was Leidenheimer but it seemed like old bread.   The spicy sauce wasn't.   The vinegar sauce was ok at best.  The corn spoon bread was ok but a little wet. No biggie either way. Just nothing we'd ever want again.  The crawfish potatoes were horrible. They had a black anise ending flavor that really turned me off.  Kind of like when people use straight crawfish boil flavor and don't doctor it up with love.  At 3 bucks per side (2 golf ball sized potato or two scoops of corn pudding) it just didn't feel like a value. 2 people, 2 sandwiches and the sides  and a bottled water.  was 30 bucks. Couldn't just get tap water or unsweetened tea.   We ended up tossing out the hardest parts of each sandwich and my potatoes and half her corn pudding. Just not appetizing.  I'd give them 3 stars but as I'm mentioned in other reviews, I really don't like places where you have to counter order, then get all your own stuff.  That's called a cafeteria and I'm just not a fan of those. So no matter if I liked the place or not, that always gets a point off. Just personal preference.    I'm really just hoping we came at a bad time. Sometimes, things just don't go perfect.  We still had a pretty good day walking Magazine Street so it wasn't so bad it ruined our whole day.   I wish them luck. It seems from the other reviews that they usually do a pretty good job.

The chicken we eventually got tasted burned, rice was clumpy and mushy, small portion compared to other locations. I get that it's a busy location but is that an excuse for poor service and quality?

The layout is cozy and though we were originally put in a high traffic spot, our server moved us to a more private table by request. We got guacamole and mole sauce along with our salsa and chips to start out. The chips tasted a little stale and the guac was just average but I really enjoyed the salsa and the mole sauce was some of the best I've ever had: creamy and sweet! For entrees I got the vegetarian enchiladas and my boyfriend got enchiladas in mole sauce. I am vegetarian and he has a gluten allergy: the menu was accommodating for both dietary restrictions and our server was helpful. My vegetarian enchiladas were fine and the green sauce they came in was delicious. The enchiladas in mole sauce were to die for!

"Very, very disappointing.  Zinburger used to be my absolute favorite burger spot in the entire world. I recently moved from Tucson to LA and visited around 6 different gourmet burger joints trying to find something comparable to Zinburger in California. Needless to say, I couldn't find anything that rivaled this place.  Fast forward two years, I recently came back to Tucson to visit and stopped by this Zinburger (2 weekends ago). My experience was depressingly bad. I have no idea what happened, or if there was some sort of management shift in the last year or two, but things have definitely changed. Here is a rundown of what went wrong:  -My burger arrived as ordered, however the buns are no longer toasted. The bottom is slightly toasted, but the top is just a room-temperature, soft roll. These things used to be buttered and toasted to perfection on both sides, now it's just a mouthful of soft, dinner-roll esque bread. Really took away from what could have been a good burger.  -One person in my party ordered her burger medium well, it came out medium rare. Fine, no problem, she sent it back. It, once again, came back almost exactly the same, AND they gave her the same bun, soaked in rare-meat juice. She sent the burger back again, and asked if they could give her a fresh bun. The burger came back, but without the bun. The new bun took 13 minutes to arrive (apparently the gluten free buns must be defrosted), and when it arrived, it was still cold in the center. By the time all was settled, the burger was cold and STILL was not cooked to medium well. She sent it back and just ordered a salad. To her dismay, she found hard, rock-like bits in her salad (something that usually happens when fresh lettuce isn't rinsed thoroughly).   -Ordered fries and fried zuchinni, the fries were cold  The management was very apologetic and helpful, they even took several items off of the bill, but it didn't curb the disappointment of the meal overall. I've heard from several people that the east side location still has the same standards as the Zinburger of old, so maybe I will have to try that location next time to restore my faith.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Weird ordering process at front counter (but you don't pay there), your food is brought out to you and then you request your check when ready.  The biggest issue is that the staff bickered about each other the entire time we were there.  Super uncomfortable. Examples would include one employee asking another where are the forks; received by rolling eyes and 'I've told you this five times'.

"My boyfriend, my best friend and I went here for the Devour Downtown experience.  They ordered from the pre-set menu and I picked something else.  The hand-battered pork tenderloin strip appetizer was really good.  The flat-iron steak my boyfriend ordered medium was beyond well done.  Completely wrong temperature and it made the steak rubbery.  It was also cold by the time it came to the table.  The veggie burger which I got had some great flavor so I was pleased with that.  The sides other than the sweet potato fries were just bland.  The fries, however, were very nice.  Dessert was fairly standard.  The brownie sundae was nothing special and the caramel cheesecake, while delicious, was obviously straight from a freezer shipped-in pie.  On the whole, get the pork tenderloin app, the sweet potato fries as a side, and be prepared to wait on your service.

"Three stars for mediocre effort, less than mediocre hot sauce, but a fair size portion of whiting.  I began this lunch trip by trying to order ahead on the app. Everything was fine until I paid and my card was charged. That's when I got a message that there was a problem with the order. (It was just a simple hot chicken sandwich, so what's the big deal?)  Since I was close to the restaurant, I decided to go inside to see what the issue was. Inside I found a large, clean open dining area with tables widely spaced. Not crowded, just 2 other customers. I stepped up to the cashier and asked about my Apple order. She said it did not go through because they do not have any chicken... They're out of chicken?. Uh???? I asked, ""what do you have"". She replied that they had fish. I said fine I'll take that. But just a sandwich. The cashier was polite but curt.   My order was prepared very quickly and I took it to my car rather than eating inside.  Needless to say it was disappointing. Two large pieces of fish, fried ok, lying on top of a piece of white bread, and some generic hot sauce sprinkled near it. Oh, and a couple of pickle chips next to a pile of raw onion. Simply not impressive for nine dollars -- although that said, the portion was decent (see photo).  Bottom line: no class, no character or ambience, no style, no flavor - other than fried. Three stars is probably generous, but today they'll get the benefit of the doubt.   So,  it's called Helen's Hot Chicken but sometimes they only have fish. Timing is everything I guess.

After asking for a metal fork I was given one (along with a crab cracker I also had to request).   The service experience is very lax so please factor that in.  The food itself was solid. Everyone enjoyed their order. I got the pound of crab legs with Boom seasoning, which is all of their seasonings mixed together.

"The only reason this location has one star is because I couldn't post a review without giving it to them. Because of the workers on this particular day, it doesn't deserve even that. I went to the counter and asked if they did salads. I was told I could make any sandwich into a salad for $2 more. I said, ""Great, I'll have the chicken pesto and a drink"". I get to the register, and the girl working (Sat. 8/27 @ 1:00-ish) forgets to add my drink. No big deal. I pay and a few minutes later, I receive my order. I open the wrapper and see that it's a sandwich. Still, not a big deal. I go to the counter and say, ""This was supposed to be a salad"". Same worker, says, ""You asked for a sandwich, and that's what you got."" I explained the whole conversation where I had asked about the salads and ordered that. She tosses the sandwich back to me and says, ""Give it to them"", meaning the friends I was with. I was thinking they would just remake the order into a salad. Nooooooo, she rung me up for another $12!!!! I asked if she was serious and she says, ""You ordered a sandwich"". Clearly, she was not listening to me when I placed my original order and was SO disrespectful!!!!!! I refused to pay for another meal. I would have been happy if they had just thrown the sandwich on a pile of lettuce, but she was so disrespectful that if I had continued to communicate with her anymore, I would have ended up needing to be bailed out of jail!!!! I will NOT come to this location again! The friends I was with ended up only taking a couple bites of the sandwich and said it was not very good. Tasteless, I think was the review.

"I spend Mon-Thur in Philly each work and El Rey has earned a permanent spot in the rotation for dinner at least once a week.  The atmosphere is great and the food has never let me down.   As far as the good goes,  I'm a huge enchilada fan and usually stick to chicken over beef, but the short rib enchiladas are phenomenal.  The pickled red onions are a welcome addition to the plate as well.  Also a fan of the chicken tostadas.  They make a perfect not too heavy meal paired with a couple Tecates after a day at the office.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"My boyfriend took me here this past Friday to celebrate VDay. I'm a big fan of Top Chef, so I was super excited! We each ordered a cocktail and they were both very good (mine was the sangria, but it's definitely not sangria, still tasty though). They started us with the gruyere roll and then the foie gras soup. Both super yummy!! The soup was sweet but also had a kick and it was the perfect amount. I wanted another roll, it was so good!! First course we had the beef carpaccio (one of my faves) and the salmon mousse. Second course I ordered the risotto and my boyfriend upgraded to the king crab pasta. The risotto was my favorite dish of the night! The mushrooms, olives, parm cheese crisps, and the risotto was cooked perfectly! The king crab pasta was really good once I got a taste of the spice that was at the bottom (first bite I got none and it just tastes kinda plain). Third course we had the Surf & Turf and the chicken...both were good, but we didn't love either of them. I thought the pork belly wasn't cooked enough, the texture just wasn't for me. Chicken was cooked perfectly but we didn't love the sauce. For dessert, we both ordered the chocolate panna cotta...I couldn't get enough of this!! The chocolate was rich and I loved the cream and cookie crumbles on top. So good!! We both loved this place! The service was incredible too, I did feel a bit rushed at times (not super relaxing) but that's typically what happens with a 4-course meal so it didn't bother me. The wait staff was very friendly and we loved the ambiance of the restaurant. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and family!

"To be honest I had the weirdest customer service experience. The food was okay so would have given it three stars if the customer service had been better. Our waiter seem less than thrilled to be serving my two sisters and I. Never cracked a smile.   I didn't notice the part of the menu where it stated checks will not be separated, my own fault. However, when I asked the waiter, he said they don't separate checks but said it in such a way that we all thought he was joking. For a split second we all thought maybe this guy had a really sarcastic sense of humor.   That was until he came back to our table carrying a menu pointing out no separation of checks.  It wasn't an issue to us that the restaurant wouldn't allow it but it was like he felt he needed to prove a point. Totally unnecessary. It was such an awkward interaction we just wanted to get out of there as quick as possible.    He must of sensed that we were all stunned by this interaction because he later came back with separate checks. We appreciated him doing it but I don't think that waiter has any idea how awkward that interaction was towards us and how negative the whole experience was.    I absolutely wanted to like this place but was extremely disappointed and have no intention of ever coming back.  To management at this place, please make sure your servers know how extremely important customer service is and how moments like this can completely impact the customer's experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We wanted to check out the vibe in other neighborhoods near downtown. We stumbled onto this restaurant and couldn't be happier that we did. It encapsulates this neighborhood- cold, rough exterior but with a hip, chic interior.  The food was delicious. We started with an appetizer sample. All fried foods, but good flavors and different sauces to brighten up the tastes.  For the sushi, we tried a few signature rolls and a few classics. The fish was delicious and the rolls were flavorful, light, and unique in the combo of ingredients. We tried the vegetarian roll with asparagus; it was delicious!

"Went for the ""new"" patio in back, or at least new to me. Took half an hour to get our food and then one of the servers, not ours, realized we had been waiting a long time and scurried off to find it. Had ordered the special - one chicken tamale and one ""barbeque rib tamale."" Asked the server, is that with bone in rib tamale? Assured it was not - but it was. Not just the bones but at least 10 bone chips, oh and very little pork meat. The chicken tamale was good. Especially the corn tamale itself.  Good salsa. Mediocre service. I think this patio is a recent feature. Maybe it needs a little time to settle. Have always liked most things I got there as take out in the past.

"This is the best BBQ I have ever had. I'm not talking about sauces/rubs/whatever - I am talking about the slow cooked meats themselves. Tasty by themselves, they are moist, tender and delicious. And the portions are huge.   The meats vary from pork and chicken, to turkey and a moist a and tender beef brisket. I'm not normally a brisket fan - but this one makes a believer out of me! And if you want a sandwich? The Smokehouse Sandwich has all the meats combined with Cole slaw for a mouthwatering taste medley that can't be beat.  Get there early - the seating area in the main restaurant is limited to about 15 tables but the Outhouse across the parking lot has additional bench-style seating.

Kinda pricy. The food is average. It's not as good as everyone says it is. It's one of those places most people go to just say they went.

"3.5  A decent enough experience but nothing you should rush to try. In fact, it was a wee bit forgettable. In another city, Row may enjoy some more notoriety, but Nashville is enjoying a renaissance of late and businesses have to step their game up if they want to compete.  The layout of the place is really fun. Think: rock & roll, rockabilly, southern, bbq, and Nashville all rolled in to one. The only snag in this vibe was the hostess. I know we all have off nights but she didn't want to be there and that apathy bled in to her interactions with my party. Thankfully, she wasn't a big part of the meal. Speaking of, the meal started with a fried pickle check-in offer. I will never say 'no' to fried pickles, so I was excited to see where the evening would take me.* It led me to a White Lightning cocktail: moonshine, cola syrup and club soda. Things were going so so well...  And then we ate. My pulled chicken sandwich came with a side of bacon mac & cheese and both were bone dry. That kind of offense you can overlook in, say, Philadelphia. In Nashville... not so much. The sauce bottles were sticky and pretty unappetizing to grab as you, then, used your hands to pick up your sandwich. As my colleague mentioned, this is to be expected in a divier establishment. When looking at a (with tip) $100+ bill, it's not exactly what you're looking for. My sandwich (on the skimpy side) wasn't even saved by the Jackalope Maple Brown beer I enjoyed. Attempting to end things on a sweet note, even the dessert flyte/flight was lacking. I left a little poorer, a bit hungry and a bit looped (thanks to the strength of my libations). A return visit to Row Kitchen would most likely mean staying at the bar and enjoying their cocktail program and beer list... and grabbing dinner somewhere else.  *It's too bad we wound up being charged for said pickles.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Damn the service here is so slow.  I sat at the bar, took me almost 10 minutes to get a menu, then another 10 minutes before the waiter came and took my order.  After my first round of sushi, nobody asked me if I needed anything else.  10 minutes later, I think the owner/hostess asked if I was done.  Then at the end, I waited around with an empty plate in front of me for a while before my waiter came back to check on me.  Despite the service, the sushi here is worth all the trouble.  They have fish here that you normally wouldn't find in other restaurants.  Leave the salmon, spicy tuna, and philly rolls for the basic sushi b**ches.  You have to go with the kanpachi, isaki, artic char, chu toro, hon maguro, and bonito.  I was really impressed with the selection of imported fish.  Each piece of fish was cut large, and sat on a medium sized ball of rice.  It was a little more rice than I would have liked, but some people probably like it that way.  The rice did fall apart when picked up though, which might be a sign that the rice preparation was rushed.  Tasted fine to me though.  I also like sushi that's room temperature.  It makes each cut of fish melt like butter in your mouth.  If you even bother with the soy sauce, ask the chef to give you a bowl of it instead.  Also, their wasabi is a little gritty.  Not sure if it's because it's dry, or maybe it's freshly grated wasabi.  It's not as spicy as the typical powdered stuff, so maybe it is fresh.  Handrolls are on point.  The seaweed wrappers are crisp, and the chefs prepare it fast enough so that they don't get soggy from all the stuff they put inside of it.  I always get a salmon skin handroll, and it never disappoints.  I got the Chilean Sea Bass today, which was advertised as a small plate, which was true to its name.  It was a slider sized piece of fish, cooked perfectly, and I wished it was three pieces in total.  The miso broth it was cooked in was delicious, but tasted like any other miso Chilean Sea Bass you'd get at other sushi restaurants.  If you ordered this at another restaurant, you'd get an entree sized portion.  They have this taco softshell crab dish as well.  It was actually really good.  The tortilla was warm and a little crispy, but chewy at the same time.  For a sushi restaurant, they made a really great tortilla.  It was filled with guacamole, which was just average.  I probably wouldn't get this again cause it was kinda pricey if I remember correctly.  Despite all my hyper-critical comments, the sushi here is truly is amazing.  Be prepared to be elbow-to-elbow if you sit at the bar.  This place gets it popping all night long, even on weeknights.  I'm coming back at least twice a week for as long as I'm here in PA.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"House of Thai is such a gem in Northeast Philadelphia.  The portions are satisfactory but can be a bit pricy if you're used to shelling out $5 for a lunch special. Plan on spending $20 per person here especially if you're going for appetizers and dessert. My favorite thing on the menu is the crispy duck salad which at $8.95 is reasonably priced and so delicious. The duck is shatteringly crisp and the spicy lime dressing is sweet and refreshing. Their tom kha gai or chicken coconut soup is a bit more on the sour side than I'm used to but still lovely and full of mushrooms, cabbage, and chicken. My girlfriend gets the red curry every time and it's very appropriately spiced for the neighborhood. What we love love love about House of Thai is their off the menu mango sticky rice. The mango is always super ripe and the sweet sticky rice with the sweet and salty coconut sauce topped with the roasted mung beans is just to die for.

"This used to be my favorite place to order sushi. There are more vegetarian options here than at most places and I really enjoy the choices. However, my experiences with ordering have been very inconsistent. Sometimes everything is great and I am satisfied. Recently there have been more than three occasions in which my food was not good. Last time, I ordered an avocado roll and they served a rotting avocado. I understand that avocado oxidizes and turns brown, but that is not what happened with this (it was spotted and black). And I didn't see it until I was already home with the take out, so at that point I couldn't feasibly get a replacement. This is disappointing and I wish I hadn't experienced this and the other similar situations - but I have several times now. Hopefully things will improve and one day I can rely on them again for my favorite sushi takeout. For now I will have to try other places.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Had the Grouper Bites which is what I usually use to rate places close to the water--and they were excellent. Overall lunch was great and the view was awesome!

"This review is based solely on my experience and the desserts. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. I had the straciatella and Nutella gelato and iced cappuccino. The gelato was pretty good, however not creamy enough and a little too sweet. My boyfriend had the tiramisu and mint expresso. Loved the espresso, however the raspberry syrup in the tiramisu sorta messes it up. On the other hand, the minute I walked in, I noticed the beautiful decors and as I try to record a video of the place, one of the workers behind the counter immediately started giving me the death stare. I had to answer my phone and my boyfriend noticed that she made a complaint to the manager. As we were leaving, she approached my boyfriend and asked him to tell me to delete the video because she doesn't like being on camera, which I completely understand, however I felt that it was very rude of her to automatically become angry at me and complained to her manager.

"My family and I visited on a Sunday that also happened to be Father's Day, so this may not have been the best day to visit Barbara's for the first time. Overall, we had a good lunch, but (IMO) it doesn't live up to the hype of the previous reviews.  The not-so-good: Since we had 5 people in our party, we had several different sides to try. Some were wonderful, and some were just ""okay"". In the ""okay"" category, I'd place the mashed potatoes, green beans, and the cinnamon apples. I ordered the fried okra, but was informed when our meal arrived that they ran out, so I asked for the mashed potatoes, instead. The fried chicken was good, but definitely not the best I've had in the area. I was a little disappointed that the fried chicken was ""boneless, skinless"" instead of ""bone-in, skin-on"" good ol' fried chicken. :-)   The great: we had a relatively short wait even though it was very busy. We arrived around 12:45, so it was probably on the downhill side of the lunch rush. The staff members were all very friendly. Regarding the food, the rolls are amazing. They arrived warm to our table shortly after our drinks were delivered, and they were gone within a few minutes. More rolls were brought with our lunch. A few sides that are really worth mentioning. I definitely recommend trying the pineapple casserole. I've never had this before, and it was surprisingly delicious. The mac & cheese was some of the best I've had in Nashville area. Also, the sweet potato casserole was a great choice.   My wife and I agreed that we would try this restaurant again in the near future.

"About a year ago or so, my girlfriend and I dined at Antonio's Pasta Grille in Temple Terrace and the food & service was so memorable that we chose to celebrate this Valentine's Day there.  However....  they might as well close that one too.  NEVER GOING BACK. EVER.  Without a doubt, the absolute WORST dining experience I've had in my life! Anticipating a busy night there, I made reservations and true enough, there was a line of couples at the front desk. I wove my way thru to the hostess and told that we had reservations for two. Amazingly, she had no list to consult or verify our reservations yet ushered us to a table... ahead of couples who had clearly been there before us.   No silverware or napkins on the table.  The service was abysmal- we sat for .30 min before our order was taken. The waitress was more interested in what was going on elsewhere in the restaurant, barely listened to our orders, didn't know the menu at all (we had to point out and describe our selections from the menu) and completely forgot to ask for our side dishes. When our salads finally came, they were wrong and by that time, we had STILL not been given silverware or napkins. The waitress, who seemed to be in the middle of an anxiety attack, kept mumbling and doing the ""dump and run""- bringing cutlery and plates and dumping the on the corner of the table without a word and running off to the next table. the hostess had to bring us refills for our drinks. A male waiter came by and presented us with another table's order. When we declined the food, he seemed distraught- never apologized- and began scanning the other tables in a panic.  As we waited and watched the chaos around us, we grew genuinely concerned that when it came, our food might be ""tampered with"" by a spiteful kitchen or wait staff.  The second round of refills were presented in Styrofoam cups without ice, again with explanation or apology. When our order finally came, the waitress failed to properly place the plate in front of each of us- giving my girlfriend's to me to pass to her. The presentation was awful and was accompanied by a random and unexplained bowl of penne pasta and red sauce we had not ordered.  The food itself was only so-so, the chicken bland and over-cooked.  I swear that the Italian sausage in my order was Johnsonville sausage from the Publix around the corner.  We had another 30 min. wait for the check and never got our sodas refilled the 3rd time.  The manager, who was dressed unprofessionally in T-shirt & jeans (to their credit, the rest of the staff were in ""uniform""), was going from table to table making half-hearted apologies to the MANY dissatisfied diners. Smiling and chuckling all the time as if everything was a joke. The manager spent a large amount of time with the unhappy couple immediately behind us, eventually comping their entire bill and having the waitress deliver them a huge slice of cheesecake. As she served it, she loudly announced, in a voice usually reserved for a 3 year old's birthday party, ""look what I've got""  We waited another 15-20 min. for our check and the waitress, who we let know our dissatisfaction throughout, had the gall to ask """"How was everything?"" in a tone that indicated that she had not processed or even listened to our complaints or those of the other diners.  The waitress tried to cover her a** by saying that she'd been in the restaurant business for 15 yrs. I call shenanigans on that- too many basic wait staff failures.  My girlfriend had to use the restroom and found it filthy and devoid of toilet paper or paper towels. The trash can was overflowing onto the floor.  Looking at Yelp after returning home, I found that ours was not an isolated experience.  2/11/14- "" the bread basket had a live cockroach in it"" 2/8/14- "" The fish and chicken dishes are dry and tasteless...new owners disheveled and unkept appearance is inappropriate for a food establishment.  Their lack of respect for women and customers overall leaves a bad taste in my mouth. They can't be bothered to put paper towels in the restrooms anymore 1/17/14- ""It was like watching a train wreck. Car by car - - Service was awful. Food poor, at best. Atmosphere painful. Watching waitresses fail at basic tasks"" 1/4/14- ""cold pasta ...... Oh the meatballs. They were cold and raw inside and completely foul. I took one bite and returned it right to my dish. They also have me some rotten Parmesan cheese... the butter had rotten garlic in it.  As I said before, never going back.... ever.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I was sadly disappointed with my dining experience and Fork & Stix after seeing all the positive Yelp reviews, and was looking forward to delicious, traditional Thai food.  My boyfriend and I went for a Valentine's Day dinner and our food was unfortunately far from what I was expecting.  Upon entering, we were seated at a small table less than a foot away from other diners on either side of us, leading to inevitable overhearing of conversations and difficulty in carrying on our own with any sort of privacy.  My Chicken Pad Thai was very blah, with bland seasonings and very rubbery egg, along with some sub-par quality chicken.  The noodles were excessively oily and the meals simply felt ""heavy"" without any of the freshness.  My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Pad Ka Krao with mild spice after being told that medium spice was ""American-level spicy.""  He said that his seemed to not have much spice at all.  In addition, his chicken appeared to be no more than grocery-style rotisserie chicken, with most of the vegetable on his plate consisting of only green beans without much variety, and those even looked as though straight out of a can.  Additionally, while we were immediately served tin cups of ice cold water, the glass bottle of water at our table was barely lukewarm.  The forks were simply sitting in a tin can at our table when we arrived which struck us as unsanitary.  The menus were pretty filthy with food(?) stains.  While these are small complaints, they added up to a sub-par dining experience that we will neither be recommending nor planning a return trip to.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Ordered out here with a couple friends. It really is a place with mixed reviews depending on what you get.  I personally got the panaeng curry and it was ok. Nothing special about the flavor, a typical curry mediocre curry. The chicken is the same as the chicken breast slices you get in any Chinese chicken dish. It's not the best chicken with curry as it was a bit dry and doesn't really absorb the flavor of the curry.  The chicken satay was pretty flavorless with a small hint of curry powder flavor.  The best thing out of the meal was the curry puff. A little on the sweet side which I enjoyed as it basically reminds me of a samosa. The most flavorful thing out of everything we ordered.  I would've given this a 3 star, but one of my friends had some pretty bad experiences with their food. Bottom line DON'T get the Pad Thai. It tasted like someone just poured a ton of salt in it. Was barely edible.  It's really a hit or miss restaurant with mediocre food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Pretty cool place, definitely bookmark worthy. I feel like it might be kinda hard to find, I would have missed it if I wasn't following someone here. It's surrounded by houses and gives off a hole-in-the-wall kind of vibe. The people here are pretty nice people. Very welcoming and home like. Hazel is an amazing cook and it really shows in her food. I was lucky enough to go there with a big group of friends and try a couple of things on the menu. Everything is good. We went later in the day and a good number of dishes had to be ruled out because they had run out of ingredients. So definitely try to go earlier in the day.  Downside for me was the location and and environment. Feels a little ghetto, which which is not a big deal for me, but I know some people are really sketched by that. The inside part of the restaurant is nothing fancy, a couple of tables and a pay to play pool table. Pretty sick sound system though, I love to come on a party night!!! But it's really just a couple tables, got to go at an off peak time if you have a big group.  All in all this is a very cool place to try out. If you like hole-in-the-wall type feels this is for you.

I ordered Larb Gai Salad with mild spice level ( ground chicken salad) has no flavor other than all of the red a green onions and I also had the rice noodle soup  with veggies that taste like oil. No flavor at all even my carrots at bottom was disgusting and tasted as if they were submerged in oil. There was even oil from the soup staining the bags all of my napkins. Just a very bad experience. Sit down and order to ensure you get good quality food.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"My husband and I decided to spend our last dinner in NOLA here. We heard great things as we were waiting for our table. We were down to less than a $100 cash so we passed on the drinks to make sure we had enough.  We ordered the crawfish boil as an appetizer. This was the first time we had tried it and the waitress showed us what we needed to do. Being used to Pacific Northwest crab, the crawfish seemed a bit bland to me. There was a pork chop special that the waitress warned us was a big portion. It was explained as a split pork chop. So we ordered that to share plus a cannelloni appetizer. The portions were huge, enough to feed at least four people easily. There were two, 2 inch pork chops smothered in different seafood sauces. Plus a side of linguine pasta. Plus the cannelloni appetizer filled with crab and corn and smothered in sauce. Needless to say we would have been fine with just the cannelloni. And that is what we should have done.  My husband only had a few bites of the pork chops and we barely made a dent in the cannelloni. He basically only liked the crawfish  and linguine and I wasn't really impressed with anything. We didn't keep the leftovers because we were leaving in the morning.  When we got the check we were thankful that we didn't order drinks because the special was 1.5 times more than the regular menu items. I wish we had kept the leftovers to hand out so I don't feel so guilty for wasting the food.  Lesson learned. Ask more questions next time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Been here twice. Food is decent. Menu is underwhelming. What really sucks here is the service. Last time I went there, I waited almost 45 minutes for food after we ordered, had to wait for them to fix one of our orders, ate food that I didn't ask for just for the sake of time, and then was told I had to wait ""like everyone else"" when I just wanted the check after waiting 20 minutes since I originally asked for it. The dinning room was cleared out, and the bar had people, so I didn't understand his issue or need to be rude. Also, most expensive Mexican I've had in a while. I mean, I normally don't complain about price, but I've spent way less and gotten way better food.  The single pro is that the drinks are good, and it's very well kept. That's about it.  I'd say the food isn't amazing enough to sit through that kind of service. The menu, again, is so underwhelming that I felt like I've pretty much got the full experience after two visits. The staff was nice upon entry, but they just didn't do a good job of time management and got an attitude on top of it.

"First attempt at eating at the new location.  I say attempt because we never got our food.  An hour and a half is to long to wait for your food.  The management needs major revamping.  You can't expect the bartender to make drinks for the whole restaurant, wait on customers at the bar and also wait on 6 tables. She even had to go to the kitchen to pick up the food that her patrons ordered.    It is a recipe for disaster, which is what it was.  It was a busy evening and was happy to see that for them but I doubt that it will stay that busy when you can't get your food.  We weren't alone, all the patrons sitting around us were upset with the service and the quality of the food they did receive. Maybe we will give them a few months and try again.

"This is a good but standard Szechuan restaurant. Meaning it's acceptable to most Chinese people, which is actually fairly high praise for Chinese food in this country. Do not come here and order some general's poultry or sweet and sour proteins. It is spicy, salty, and greasy - as it should be, so set your expectations in order.   Order the conventional Szechuanese dishes, which is their strength. That means anything with yuxiang (fish fragrance), most popular with pork or very good with eggplant. They have good water cooked fish. Most Chinese people do not order the appetizers. Their fire-exploded kidney flowers is quite good. These names might not be the names on the menu, as we order in Chinese and I can't personally remember the English names.   Smug Americans, who might have passed through Sichuan, might dismiss these fairly pedestrian dishes, but this is what they do best. The popularity of Szechuanese food is due to its supposed spicey taste, so clueless chefs and eaters can't discern it well. Authenticity is a moot point here - most Chinese people are not from that area and cannot tell if it's real or not. Some of us actually come here anyways to celebrate a new job, friends visiting.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I also had a cronut which is a cross of a croissant and a donut which equals deliciously soft inside and flaky outside and it was flipped into sugar on both sides.  They have a small but nice menus with salads of sorts and several types is sandwiches plus lovely bakery items.

"0 stars!! that must be made obvious!  To start let me list the seen problems: 1. staff standing around socializing instead of working the floor, 2. lack of managment on the floor. 3. Kitchen inconsitancy., 4. Lack of kitchen staff hygene. 5. Customer service/attention to detail  I've been in the Food Service industry most of my working life, and NEVER have I been so sickened by the lack of quality service from a restaurant in my entire life. It all started off fine and a BIG BIG props to our server Kaitie who was very understanding of our needs, though she seemed to be the only one truly concerned for her customers. Our meal came to us completely wrong (the kitchen need to learn their seasoning spices much better). To top it off we were presented with the Credit card and finalized bill of another guest. When I told the young lady that it wasnt my card (honestly I only have a bank card and cash I don't trust credit card companies) I was told I was wrong (yes I must be my name really is heather even though my drivers liscence says John) When she left the card even after i said it wasnt mine I asked the bartender for a manager. after a good five minute plus wait for a floor manager (I'm guessing they were on break) I handed the card to him and proceded to let him know how Illegal it was to give one customer another customers credit card! I also mentioned how the young lady who handed to me acted when told it wasn't mine. I was told it wasn't my concern and I should just let it be. SERIOUSLY! I wanted to take the card back and shout to the dining room asking for the card holder so I COULD EXPLAIN why I had her card. To make matters worse than all this I went to the head shortly after to relieve and wash back up before leaving. I happened to notice one of the cooks in the mens head using the urinal. after promptly urinating on half the floor he left without washing his hands. When I returned to my seat ready to vomit from thinking about who had cooked and handled my meal I noticed 4-5 servers atanding at the end of the bar all with their phones out, I'm pretty sure their hand book bans the use of cell phones while on the clock (like most places do) this over did me. I had been excited to try the place out after seeing the eye apeasing commercials, and hearing the good things about this place when it first opened, but it was a huge let down. Over priced food that was so far past bland it hurt.   Cooking is a art form in and of itself, Even in chains the cooks take pride in their food and you know when they do for it shows. at Joes crab shack there is no passion for the food nor is there a pride in the prep, plating, or taste of the food.

I don't know and maybe one day I will find out, but not any time soon.    Before I really begin, a word about their delivery.  It was an EXCELLENT experience.  It is cheap and quick  and FRIENDLY, which is helpful and rare.  So kudos on the delivery guy.  Maybe I am wrong in this, but I thought a club was cut into neat little triangles and that a tuna club was served with sliced egg.  Not here, evidently.  This was just a sandwich with a piece of bread in the middle.  Tuna, lettuce and tomato.  That was the first disappointment.    The tuna itself is awful.  It looked like it might be good because ti had celery in it but not, it was just awful.  I ate only half of the sandwich because I was super hungry (this is what happens when you eat lunch at 3) but it is not anything I would want to try again.  The lettuce and tomato were good, though.  The fries were blander than bland and over cooked so not even ketchup helped.  Perhaps I could have added salt but didn't think of it until now because I was too busy being upset.  Like I said, maybe this is a great pizza joint but I wouldn't recommend the tuna or fries and fries are kind of central to pizza places, if you ask me, which, because you're reading this, you did :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"This place is TOO SWEET-o! I could not choose, from the menu, so after much palaver about what I might like, they brought me a sampler platter. Goat meat - firm and TASTY. Greens - spicy and delicious. Plantains - not too sweet, not too starchy - just right. But the palm red oil the goat bits were served with - holy CATS. If you've never had palm red oil, you just haven't lived. Smooth, spicy, exciting, terrible for your arteries and just a perfect joy.  Add a seriously real African restaurant vibe - not a bunch of cutesy carvings, no slick wall hangings; just honest mom n pop restaurant detritus, a restaurant focused on food and food only.   The neighborhood wanders through and talks politics, religion and just things. The owner brags about his son the excellent footballer and how good a cook he is (I can attest firmly to the latter!). Parking is on the vibrant street, but watch out for the no-parking zones. And it's tight on the streetcar line.   Go there. A-o!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"The historic building is charming and food was very good.  Unfortunately, we were sitting in the bar right over the AC great - we both had jeans on but was blowing enough that we had to put jackets over our laps.  Also, while I grew up in the 80's and love the Smiths and other new wave it was way too loud and frankly, an odd dinner choice for music.  The waitress was attentive.  Also, didn't bother me much but if you eat in the historic pub you will basically be eating in the dark.  there is a fireplace and a few hanging lamps over the actual bar.  I suppose it did provide an authentic feel to match the history of the building.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"A friend & I stopped in after the Carpinteria Beer Festival and were looking forward to some fresh food for an early dinner. We waited outside sipping water for about 30 minutes while they prepped for dinner service. That was great considering we had been in the sun for hours, so shade & fluids worked perfectly for both of us.  While the service was very nice, what didn't work so well for us was the quality of the food, including the fish & chicken. The fish just wasn't very good caliber, including bloodlines in the Yellowtail, plus the chicken was undercooked so much that my friend wouldn't eat it. I worked my way around the reddest parts, but we shouldn't have had to deal with undercooked poultry. She declined to order something else, so we settled the bill and figured it was a lesson learned.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Fantastic! Been waiting years for them to open, glad they finally did! I do have some complaints that are the reason for the 4 stars.    1. Some of the chips were soaked in lime/lemon where as others were completely dry. I assume this is because they just opened and don't quite now how to mix them?  2. Skimpy on some of the toppings. I got less than a half spoon of rice on my burrito, had to ask for more. And when I got to the lettuce, I asked for extra lettuce they gave me about 6 small shredded pieces. I had to ask for more 3 times and gave up when it still wasn't ""extra lettuce"".  Besides those minor complaints. DELICIOUS! About time!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"I've tried this place a couple of times, trying to give it a fair shot.  With a convenient location and a great deck, I really wanted this to be a good little Mexican restaurant.  The service is terrible and the staff act as though they could care less.  If the food is an indicator, that attitude goes on to the kitchen staff as well.  Even the salsa tastes like something from a jar.  The last time I was there, I passed some of the kitchen staff outside smoking on my way out... if I didn't get the feeling the place was as clean as it could be inside, the looks of the kitchen staff just made me feel worse.

"This was very disappointing for a new sushi place in town. I understand working out the kinks in a brand new establishment, but there's no excuse to be understaffed, have minimal stock on hand, have awkward service from your staff, and bad ambiance. There was one sushi chef trying to serve the entire bar and floor tables, and he was getting no support from the staff in the kitchen (it took us over 30 minutes to get our mussels which we ordered as soon as we sat down). The sound system wasn't playing in the place so it was awkward silence of customers trying to whisper to each other, and because the chef was trying to move so quickly, some of the rolls didn't taste very good. The chef and the hostess were arguing with each other in Spanish and they were out of ginger...which come to find out, was sitting at the bar the entire time - the staff just didn't look. Finally over an hour into our meal, more wait staff and a chef showed up. The service improved slightly however there was lots of confusion happening between the chefs and our orders were messed up a few times (we had to keep clarifying and repeating ourselves). Finally we gave up on our meal and asked for the check so we could quickly leave. Unfortunately there are far too many better sushi places to go to and we won't be coming back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Was in need of some good Mexican food before catching a plane home, used my helpful Yelp app and we were off to Taqueria La Flama. The only reason for 4 stars, was for not very clean. The floors needed to be cleaned, dirty tables etc. But we were on a mission and pushed through it. The menu is up above the register, kinda hard to see. The staff was friendly and our order was taken easily. Then off to find a clean table, which we did. Our meal was brought out very quickly. WOW - amazing flavor!! The beans were so good, it was the first thing we went after. I ordered the chicken flautas and my husband ordered the carne asada platter. This place did not disappoint at all.

"This place is the worst. I stopped by to order some quick food and I feel like I got ripped off because I paid $72 dollars plus a tip for super bad food. I ordered chicken fried rice which was greasy and a piece of the chicken I bit on had gristle or something. I ordered Moo shoo pork that was mediocre at best and beef with broccoli that was okay, but I found a random peanut in it which was odd. Next was orange chicken for the kids. The feedback on that was, ""It was ok, but it was just dry.""    Don't even get me started on how bad the appetizers were...okay, I'm reviewing so here goes. Crab Rangoons were empty. No crab in there. Heck, no cheese either. There was literally a fried empty wonton with about  1/4 tsp of cream cheese on the top of them. Next, the fried wonton with pork...dry AF and just bad. Last, was potstickers. Dripping in grease and the kids were like, "" What ARE those?!"" Yes, they know what pot stickers are supposed to look like...  I should have turned around when I walked in. It smells greasy and looks like it could use a good deep clean. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, but it was a complete waste as we threw away stuff because it was just...gross. Do not go there expecting quality food. Also, the two people in the front of the house could use a brush up on customer service. I think they couldn't have cared less about being there. I will never go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
Food: Not too excited about the quality of fish they use there. Yes I know this is an all-you-can-eat however I still think they they could've have used a bit of a higher quality ingredients. Their regular dishes were okay which is what I would come here eat. However if you're really hungry and you prefer the quantity of food then this place definitely checks off those boxes.  Cost: The price wasn't bad for an all you can eat establishment.   Environment: The place inside seemed pretty big- there were a lot of seats available so if you want to come here with a large party I believe they would be able to easily accommodate everyone!  Service: service was pretty quick though- we came with a party of 6 and were attended to within a reasonable amount of time.  Uniqueness: All you can eat places can be a big hit or miss. The regular dishes were decent so definitely come here even if you don't like sushi.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Sat at the bar for a quick lunch before shopping at the mall.  I ordered the mezcal-based drink.  It was ok, a little sweet but tasty.  They have an ordering system that you would expect to find at a sushi bar.  A piece of paper with a list of all the menu items and you tick the boxes.  This is kind of clever because I am sure most (me too) would like to sample several different versions of their tacos.  (which I did)  Also because a table of four people that orders 16 different tacos is going to mess up the server pretty badly ha ha.  I ordered 3 different kinds and they were all quite tasty and had a good mix of sweet sour and salty.  Unfortunately they took a bit of time to come out even though the restaurant was only half full.  The décor is very pleasant and modern, there was music playing which I thought was a bit too loud especially for lunchtime and actually a person (a young person, mind you!) near me at the bar remarked on it too.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Woot!  Review 199, next person wins a free sticker from me for being review 200.  (Ok, I lie.)  I am a pretty big fan of the pancake pantry, but I'm not a religious freak about it by any means.  I would gladly wait 30 minutes and under to eat at the pantry, but I would not wait an hour or more which some people are known to do.  The pancakes, in case you did not figure it out, are their specialty.  I enjoyed the Georgia Peach pancakes today with a side of two eggs over-easy.  Nice pieces of peach and a sauce like the inside of a peach pie topped my pancakes and was stuffed inside my rolled up enormous pancakes.  There was also butter and some whipped cream.  They serve pure maple syrup, but who cares!  Did you read the ingredients of my pancakes?  I did not need the syrup on this day, dear Yelpers.    You can find parking both on the street and in the pay-lot behind the building.  Sure, traffic is a nightmare in the village but that's part of the village's charm... I think.

"This review is just for the lunch special as I haven't yet tried any of their specialty rolls  $10.95 for 3 rolls of your choice ( 8 pieces each) served with miso soup, and free delivery for orders over $10. The delivery was really fast, within 30 minutes of my ordering, so kudos there!   Since the whole city pretty much has that 3 roll for $10.95 deal , I pretty much consider it a standard deal now , one of the reasons for my 3 star review.  Food wise -- my favorite was the yellowtail scallion -- in my opinion really fresh fish which is much appreciated. The spicy tuna and California were okay -- I've generally had better California rolls in my past packed with more flavor and imitation crab meat. The miso soup was also a bit of a bummer because there were so few tofu and seaweed floating around, which costs pennies to make.. so just a bit of a pet peeve of mine to skimp out on that.   Overall, fast delivery and a good option if you're craving cheap and fast sushi for less than $15.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"What a disappointment.  With only three nights in NOLA, I can't believe we went to Trinity.  Service was a huge disappointment .  We flew into NOLA in the evening, checked into the hotel and headed to Trinity around 8:30.  We were exhausted from traveling all day and it looked like it was going to be a nice experience.  I should have read the yelp review before going that the best seating was in the back at the bar.  We were seated a table and everything went downhill from there.  We wanted a couple cocktails and a couple of appetizers to wind down and relax before getting into dinner.  We were told by our waitress that we needed to order all of our food at once.   What????   So we just had a cocktail and waited until we were ready to order everything at once.  I was already upset by now.  My cocktail was fantastic.  It was like a Manhattan with a smokey mescal mix.  Wow!!  So we decide to go ahead and stay for dinner.  I start ordering with baked oysters and the waitress made a funny face and said that the oysters were cheesy.  Hello?  On the menu it says with oysters parmesan.  I ordered it anyway and now cut back our choices to the ricotta gnudi,  the scallops and one other entre, (can't remember probably because I don't want to remember this meal).    The baked oysters were incredible, (should have gotten two orders),  and the ricotta gnudi was very good.  The scallops were unremarkable.  The actual scallops were very good but the plate's flavors didn't live up to the quality of the scallops.  There's so many good restaurants in NOLA to experience.  Don't waste a valuable night here. Go somewhere the service is equivalent to the money you're spending and you're treated like a valued customer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Good BBQ, terrible inedible bread, aka sliced wonderbread clone which should not be served on their dishes that are priced at a premium. Bad fries also. Simple feedback. WKitchen is quite expensive for such small portions considering it is BBQ. Never paid as much for BBQ before in California. Left hungry, spent $75 for lunch for 2 people and 1 cocktail. Their brisket ramen at Ramenfest was delicious though. Firestone in SLO, Traildust BBQ, Aptos street BBQ & Gilroy BBQ are all far better quality/pricing/service than WKitchen. Nobody should ever serve that awful flavorless wonderbread aka ""Pain de mie"" with every dish when it is so expensive. You can't feed that bread to ducks or birds if you love animals.

"Tried this restaurant awhile back with a friend as it was close to her class location and I've enjoyed trying things from the restaurant when at the Taste of Edmonton.   Full disclosure - I'm  a meat eater but I do eat & cook vegetarian because I care for my friend's and try to make it less stressful picking places to eat. So I'm not new to this food selection. The waitress attending to us was knowledgeable about the menu. From our discussion with her, we selected some smaller dishes that would be good to share. I really enjoyed the cauliflower bites as they were the right consistency between crispy outside and cooked inside of the cauliflower. There was a sauce that added the extra amount of flavour to the dish. The veggie chicken in the king pao chicken was interesting. I knew immediately I wasn't eating chicken because of the texture but the flavours of the dish worked nicely together. Enough that I could ignore the texture to eat the dish. If you're a texture person too, then don't select the chicken satay as I think it would be even more noticeable. The ginger (soy) beef I wasn't wild about. Even with the tasty side of rice we ordered, it didn't really do much palate wise. I was also surprised to see it lacked quantity of veggies. Even though the waitresses were awesome and refilled our large water glasses (4 times as we felt dehydrated), the food and the large amount of water didn't give me the happy full feeling. It's a confusing feeling to have after eating a sizeable meal. I was intrigued by some other parts of their menu and if I was to find myself here again, I most likely would enjoy a massive bowl of soup.  As for the selection of 3 stars, I found that even though the restaurant is large, the layout is something that takes away from enjoying the food here. Seating people so close forces you to be part of other table's conversations. The wait staff can't properly reach the tables due to this layout during supper rush. We watched them struggle to serve as more people were seated. At one point the server had to come at a completely different direction (through the roped off ramp and pilar area) to even get to our table which meant she reached behind the table that was literally beside us. This situation made us feel uncomfortable. Also, I wouldn't advise bringing anyone here that struggles with hearing. It was too loud to have a proper discussion. These things made us feel like we should rush through our meal so we didn't have to be there anymore.  Lastly, I struggled to find parking. I don't carry a lot of cash on me and therefore have even less change. So if deciding to park at this lot, remember to bring your coins. There are a few spots along the street, but consider yourself lucky if you're able to grab those. Honestly going a bit further north you can find free parking and better walking situation to the restaurant. Cleared walks are always my preferred choice over the risking a fall on a frozen & slippery parking lot.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Sexual Harassment By Staff TW: My friend and I went to the unisex bathroom on the second floor. There were no signs indicating ""single occupancy"" so we entered together. While she was using the restroom, 2 male security guards knocked on the door and we said ""no"" since my friend was using the restroom. Then, they proceeded without our consent to barge down the door while my friend was half-naked, exposing her to multiple male securities guards waiting outside. They refused to close the door to give her privacy to get dressed. They told us we violated a policy by going to the bathroom together, yet there was no sign indicating so.

As a result, we had to have a police officer come to explain what happened--he filed a report for us. The dogwood staff banned us from their property without an explanation.

"I have frequented La Terraza for a few years, as I work nearby. It's always a great place for an affordable lunch with good chips and salsa.   However, I have gone twice recently after probably not having been in a year or so, and really don't think I'll back. The first time was right before Christmas, and I ordered the Alambres. They had previously been my favorite meal, but this time they were awful. There was so much fatty under cooked bacon in the skillet that I could not enjoy my meal. I was picking it out every other bite to set to the side, and by the end I had a huge pile of really fatty barely cooked bacon. This last time I went back, and they had redone their menu. No longer is there the affordable $5 lunch. Instead it was all $8-10 lunch entrees, which were basically the same prices as most of the other regular sized entrees. I enjoyed my fajita nachos, but I just am not looking to pay $12-15 for Mexican food for lunch. There are so many better options around Nashville that offer the same price point that La Terraza is just not worth it to me.   One other thing to note that I found insane was that the tacos authentico, which I pay $1.35 per taco for at any sort of taco stand was $3.25 EACH. That's insane.   Service is usually pretty good, and the restaurant is nice and clean, and I do enjoy that they have a patio and also the barrel chairs inside are a fun touch.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"After the Concierge @ our hotel gave us a recommendation for this establishment, (as well as a 10% off coupon) we were drawn to eat here. We were sat right away in the upstairs portion of the establishment. Upstairs had maybe one too many TV sets playing random programs. USA network, and 2 ESPN might be a little much. Also, was a little too quiet up there. Seemed like sitting downstairs would provide a better experience for this joint.   Our waiter was very friendly, but seemed maybe to have been a little crusty from years of sevice, (though he didnt seem more than 30 or so years old..). Also enjoyed the random door painted to advertise their 'Katrina' inspired Hurricane drink..seemed a bit off color though..geez  I ordered the taste of New Orleans, and my friend had the Crab cake fettucini. The obvious jokes of tasting the actual city of New orleans came up between us and the server..good times were had. I must say the red beans and rice were to die for.... maybe NOT as good as the Crab cakes though... wow. 99.9993% sure that was the best crab cake I have ever had.

"Called last night and placed an order. Was told that it would take 17 minutes (odd but punctual). We arrived there to find out that they never got the order because when you order over the phone, you're talking to a call center rather than the restaurant itself... which was not brought to our attention. We then told the restaurant our order (2 larges), paid for it and 20 minutes later received one large and one medium and we couldn't change it to a large because the kitchen closed. Also the lady taking the order was unhelpful and rude. There was one person, Timber, in particular who was sweet and trying to make things right.. so thank you. Hopefully things won't be so choppy next time for future customers.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Decent, but undistinguished pizza, though they're not kidding that they are big-ass sizes. You can order a normal slice or a ""big ass slice"", which is the size of 2 regular slices for about the price of 1.5 slices.  Ordered a regular size veggie slice - I commend that the veggies were fresh. Something felt lacking in flavor, though I can't put my finger on it. The sauce and cheese could be better, but there is a nice garlic note in the crust.  Service was unnecessarily slow...I spent a few too many seconds waiting for the cashier to finish her conversation with a friend before she would notice me and take my order. I'm not a stickler for super-attentive service, but I felt awkward enough.  This spot will be your homebro if you find yourself extra ravneous and possibly drunk late at night around Olde City.

"This is a Happy Hour bar review.  I had read some unflattering reviews of the happy hour menu, prices and service, so was a little hesitant to try it.  I must have been at a different restaurant.  I found the size of the happy hour dishes to be generous, the food was good, and the prices were excellent.  The service at the bar by Jorge was fast and attentive.  I was very please overall with the experience.  The two cocktails I tried were well made, not strong, but good.

"Went for Happy Hour with my sis in tow and spent over $80 and no real food???  the drink specials were good but when I asked for another drink with less ice, she came back with a different glass but the same amount of ice!!!!  Ok, I got eyes, you just tried to disguise the fact by putting it into a different size glass.  The oyster po boy was fresh, too bad they cut it in half so a sandwich actually became a slider.  I should have ordered the cheeseburger but I came to a seafood restaurant, not a burger joint.  Had to call over another server at one time to get some more napkins because ours had mysteriously disappeared.  By the way, I dont think she ever gave us her name.    Anyway, will not be coming back anytime soon, just a little over my budget and because of the unexpected price, never made it to dinner.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"First time in New Orleans so an oyster restaurant was a must. The famous Acme was closed for the night so we looked this place up and decided to give it a try. It was July 4 weekend so Bourban street was PACKED and there was a line to be seated in the restaurant. I could see in that the place had no empty tables but it was fine for me and my husband....that just meant it was gonna be a good meal! We waited in line for about 15 minutes in the stuffy humidity( honestly I have never been so hot and sweaty in my life and I live in Phx, Az!), then some other employee came up to our hostess and said that there are free tables. What?!! Free tables? Why are we in line then !?? So we followed the man to an upstairs dining area, which I had no idea existed, only to see that it was only a third occupied! So many empty tables! We were seated but our waitress took forever to come and take our order. We just ordered a dozen raw oysters and half a dozen of their baked oysters topped with cheese or something..can't remember. For some reason, it took about 45 min for our food to arrive. People who came in after us received their food before us and more than one table too. Our waitress would just stop by and say our food should be coming out soon. Soon? It should have been out 30 min ago, and it doesn't even require cooking! Then we heard a diff waitress explaining to a table next to us that the oyster shucker disappeared for awhile but is now back. Huh? Why didn't our waitress tell us that? But after awhile, our food came and they were the best oysters we have ever had..yummy! It took us another 15 min for our waitress to notice us and give us the check. I handed her my credit card and she came back to wish us a good night but she took off to who knows where without giving me my card back. Seriously, we had no idea where she went because she didn't even go back to the other tables. We waited and waited for 10 min. So my husband decided to go hunt her down. He finally asked a worker and their matter of fact response was that she was on break and asked what did he want her for. My husband finally got the card back from the waitress who swore she had already given it back. So we just left with no apology.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Probably one of the better places for lunch in the Liberty place food court.  The line is usually long, but it goes by pretty quick. Your food is created assembly line style (think Chipotle), so you'll be talking to different people as they compile your food.  The lamb shawarma salad is my go to. Actually quite flavorful, and the toppings you add are your choice, so if you don't like how it turns out..... it's kind of your own fault. I get a little confused with which toppings are free and which are extra, but I guess I could ask.  Cucumber is big here, so you know I'm dousing my salad in that cucumber tatziki yogurt sauce.  Portions aren't huge, but quality is there. The lamb is nowhere near as greasy as the ones I've gotten from the food carts outside. It's a little pricier too, but i'd pay more money for less grease all day long. I just wish pita bread was included with the meal instead of being extra.  The staff is friendly though, even if for the brief moment you interact with them. They don't seem to hate their jobs, so that's always a plus.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

They do offer you La Colombe coffee while you're waiting so that's always nice on a cold day.   LEMON BLACKBERRY CRUNCH FRENCH TOAST($14) || There were three slices of French toast stacked beautifully with blackberry compote, Chantilly cream and lemon syrup. Their specials change all the time but there is always a French toast special. You MUST get it. It never disappoints.   BUFFALO MAC AND CHEESE ($13) || I don't really like buffalo flavored foods but this is to die for. The buffalo sauce and he cheese is balanced perfectly with long curly noodles (maximum cheesey surface area) and fried buffalo chicken on top. As always they nail the fried chicken (anyone's who has had their chicken and waffles can confirm).

"If you come in at the right time, The Drake is pretty good. The food is actually very good and the beer selection, which in my opinion is a little sparse, is good enough. The problem starts when there are more than 15 people in the bar.  The place can get crowded, although I'm not really sure why, and that means it gets loud, and I mean really loud. The wait staff is a joke, and the managers are just as bad if you can find them. I've been there multiple times where I had to walk out after being seated and waiting over 15 minutes for a waitress. It has potential, but you're just better off hitting The Kitchen Bar.

We could hear faint music from a nearby church and there is little car traffic noise so outside seating is very pleasant. Service was nominally slow.  But for my food... My table mates seemed please with their pasta choices and salads. I however, had a margarita pizza that was on a bland crust heavy with cheese. My cedar plank wild salmon (medium) with beurre blanc sauce came out completely overcooked.

"The deprived Hawaiian that I am, well not really, finally got his second chance to dine at this chain not yet found in Hawaii.  ATMOSPHERE: Older-looking restaurant but pretty clean overall.  BEVERAGE: Out of Heineken.  Loss of 1 star!  FOOD: Caesar Salad - Horrible.  Served on a warm, almost hot plate, thus making the lettuce warm.  Dressing flavor was okay.  Minestrone Soup - The taste was good, but temperature was lukewarm.  Come on!?   Grilled Shrimp Caprese - It was like eating a pizza but instead of the crust, it was the pasta, topped with 8 good-sized grilled shrimp - the best part of the dish, an overkill of mozzarella cheese, chunky tomatoes, and garlic butter sauce poured on one side of the dish.  Very sloppy and visually unappealing.  SERVICE: We walked in without reservations and got seated immediately.  Our male server was friendly and service was pretty quick.

The waiter then came by a few minutes later saying the chefs made bbq wings instead of hot wings and we had to wait longer. By the time we finished our entrees the appetizer finally came out. We were barely checked on and were never asked how our meals were. The burgers were greasy and soggy and the broccoli side dish was over cooked with no flavor.

The staff was very friendly, as you can expect, and went out of their ways to be really attentive on Christmas, although I'm sure they would have much preferred being elsewhere.  I ordered my ribeye medium rare, it came medium well.  I'm not sure if the waiter misunderstood me, but I wasn't in the mood for sending it back.  Fortunately, a ribeye can take a beating and still be relatively tender due to the fat content.  Aside from that, typical experience that I've had at many other steak houses, not any better or worse.

"In the south there is a term ""Fair to Middlin'"".  I suppose this pretty adequately sums up Tequila's. Once you get past the fact that the seats are very hard and the table and booths seem to be on ice, scooting around despite your best efforts to keep them in place (When I went to leave I almost took the booth out the door with me).  Service was good, but the menu warns that each table gets TWO helpings of Chips.  I'm not sure if they are sticklers for this or if its just on there to prevent you from having an ""All You Can Eat Chip Buffet.""  The Fried Burritos would appear to be the signature dish, and I was not disappointed in them.  They didn't particularly blow me away, but I found them to be satisfactory.

"I've been to the Ybor location of Tampa Bay Brewing a couple times now. The beer here is excellent and the food is also pretty decent.  My most recent visit was during the time of coronavirus. We met with the hostess and we had to wait a few minutes, maybe 5 or so. All the tables were spaced out and seating was limited inside. They also had outdoor seating available.  Our server greeted us promptly. While we waited, we scoped out what food we wanted so we were ready to go. We split a pretzel and chicken strips. The pretzel wasn't on their normal menu, it was a special for the day. The chicken strips are technically a starter or appetizer. I also ordered a beer, the Lawn Daddy, a German style pilsner. During a vacation to Germany, I developed a preference to a local pilsner there, called Distelhauser. You can't get Distelhauser outside of that small area in Bavaria. I was very happy that the Lawn Daddy reminded of it.  Our food was pretty good. The chicken strips were lightly breaded with a crisp, thin breading. It wasn't too heavy or seasoned and allowed the white meat chicken to shine through. I had ranch to dip and my fiance had buffalo. The pretzels were also really good. The $4 order came with two decent sized pretzels. I was only expecting one. I'm pretty sure it came with a side of mustard.  All in all, we had a good visit. The food and beer were spot on and I'm sure we will be back. The Lawn Daddy was so good that I ordered a 4-pack of cans to-go.

"Favorite Chinatown bakery!  For a couple reason's KC is my go-to stop for buns and pastries alike. First, their buns look the best. Some places, the bread looks squished and generally unappetizing. Their's is also plump and gleaming. Their egg tarts also look pristine. Second, everything is always fresh. No need for refrigeration of their goods. Often times, the buns are still warm when I purchase them and I never have to worry about getting stale bread, even towards the end of the day. Third, the staff there is so nice. I only visit maybe 1-2 times a month, but they always recognize me and try to make conversation.  The only complaint I can think of is their pricing. Definitely one of the pricier of Chinatown bakeries, however, you are getting your money's worth in terms of quality. Next time you're in the area, stop by and pick up a couple buns.

They have an awesome selection for a very, very low price, especially for lunch.  I'm a sucker for egg rolls, crab rangoon, dumplings, and dim sum.  I just love them and have a very flexible palate when it comes to them.

"2.5 stars at best (and yelp reeeeeally needs to start doing half stars on rating scale).  glad it was open till late on Easter Sunday, so we didn't feel like we were keeping people from going home, entering close to 8pm as group of 6.  that said, it was downhill from there.  issues: - sat outside on the patio, which is cool, except the chairs -- while great for lounging -- are too low and reclined for eating at the table. and there was no seat cushion to bump it up.  - i ordered a ginger basil mango mojito. there was no ginger, no basil, no mango, nor mojito. got some sugar syrup on ice with a slice of orange and mint leaf instead. didn't realize it was completely different than what i ordered - and absolutely gross - until half point; didn't want to send it back as if i was looking for a handout. not sure what i was charged for that either. - ordered ""plain"" wings from kids menu, came out looking and tasting like buffalo wings, a bit spicy for little kids. inquired with waiter and was told this was ""plain"" indeed; not sure what ""hot"" would be, then. he was great to quickly offer to switch. we kept the first one for us. - ordered shared appetizer (lobster queso dip), with no plates to use. settings came after orders were put in. strange but ok. - poor kid also didn't get a setting. ate mac and cheese with hands, and no napkin. over-prepared mom came through. - restaurant didn't seem THAT busy (8:30pm on a Sunday night), yet we had to wait nearly - if not over - 30 min for entreés to show. what we ordered, you ask? steak (quickest to cook), prime rib (already done), ribs (already done)...yeah i can't think of a reason why, either. - food's cooked right and tasted mostly ok, but for ~$25 per plate, i'm disappointed overall. would be a solid 3-star if price point is at 20% less. - menu choices weren't that exciting either: prime rib, steak, steak, steak, salmon, chicken, meatloaf, burger. zzzz...   a total bleh.  the server was very friendly and polite. only saving grace. oh, and they offer gluten-free menu.  not looking to return - that much money to spend on mediocrity. would have felt better having gone to apple bees, knowing that you'd get similar food for less, without having to suffer from pretension to be ""high end"" when it's not.  outdoor seating was a nice feature on fair weather days. but dining at a mall parking lot comes with a price. if no cars in sight or within earshot, ie. late at night, it's great. can't expect the same tranquility during the day.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"This place is just down the street from my house and I'd never stopped in. Now I'm kicking myself for all the times I could have had an awesome meal for a great price.   From the first moment I walked in the door I knew I had made the right choice.  There wasn't an empty table in the place and they were lining up for their take out orders.   Everything I saw being served looked good. The lunch/dinner dishes were huge portions and seemed to be in line with their price.   The Maduros were wonderful. Not too oily and had a perfect crunch. The Croquetas were actually better than the ones I had in the Miami airport and had a great flavor.   The Empanada's were also better than the ones in the Miami airport and were stuffed with meat.   I opted for a pressed sandwich but went with the turkey to change things up. Honestly they could have pressed the bread a little darker for my taste but it was very good.  Next time I go in, I will pass on the sandwich and opt for the Fricase de Pollo which was getting rave reviews from the man sitting next to me at the bar.  The service was great and the staff was very attentive.   For the price and quality/quantity of food it is a better choice than the fast food offering across the street.

When I was walking back to my car after dinner I made a point to look for the parking signs, and I didn't see a single indication that there was any restaurant parking.  As a matter of fact, there are numerous signs that say 'Permit Parking Only'.  So, take your chances with this one.  As for the food, I was really impressed.

The chicken meat wasn't too dry but it was absolutely flavorless and had zero seasoning on it. I actually began to avoid the chicken pieces because they were so bad.   Also, the salsa added on top was clearly made from lower quality ingredients because the tomatoes just tasted like more water. I couldn't even tell when I was eating the guacamole because that had no taste either. I had to add salsa from the salsa bar just to provide some flavor. However, this also added even more liquid to what was becoming a soup.   There are so many other Mexican restaurants to choose from, so I don't think I'll have a reason to come back. It's unfortunate because the employees were very friendly, which is why this place gets 2 stars rather than 1 star.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I've been in mourning of my precious Lakeside since the doors closed and can't seem to get over it.  On several recommendations, I tried Szechuan Tasty House recently on 2 occasions.  Really great stuff here.  Some of the szechuan dishes are spectacular, including (darn...I forget the name) of these super spicy pork ""stew"" sitting in a very spicy sauce.  The spicy dumplings were a great start also.  Beware a few items that just don't work, for me, ANY of the fried items.  The salt and pepper shrimp and orange chicken were way over-fried and over-battered.  Also, STH delivers a fantastic version of my all time favorite dish, Chow Ho Fun.

"Visiting from LA, we had a fantastic meal here with relatives who live locally. What impressed us a lot was the use of local ingredients prepared with care and imagination. The six of us shared a number of starters that allowed us to sample the menu widely. The KFC cauliflower was a crowd pleaser, with the right balance of crunch, sweetness and spicy kick. Lots of restaurants in L A serve  roasted marrow bones, and Taverna 1903's version is just as good - if not better - than anything we've had at fine restaurants at home. We also tried two salads: gem and the great big salad. Both had farm fresh ingredients and were absolutely delish.   The six of us shared three entrees for the second course. The short ribs were fork tender and flavorful. Salmon was a hit, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The grilled steak also was cooked to a perfect temperature, and was very satisfying. Sides again called upon seasonal treats like pea tendrils, asparagus and roasted corn.  Friendly and professional service, good wine list, lovely decor and only a short walk from the charming Hotel Macdonald where we were staying. A winner of a place and I highly recommend.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Man I have loved this place for years and the sushi is great but something has to change with their phone system. When the call was answered the robot said I was third in line and the estimated hold time is 3 minutes.  Every couple of minutes the estimate got bumped up and for the last 40 minutes it has been saying I'm next in line. I just drove over here to put my order in and tell them something is wrong with their phone system and the guy at the bar said he was instructed to turn the  phones off (they aren't off). I said, ""okay I'll just put my order in now.""  ""It's an hour and a half wait.""  ""I don't want a table I just want to order sushi.""  ""Yeah I know, it's a ninety minute wait for that.""  Yeah I get that if this was my first interaction it would be a ninety minute wait. But they can hear the endless loop of, 'you call is now first in line and will be answered by the next representative. Thank you for your patience,' coming out of my phone and it is clear that I have already been waiting for 45 minutes now and that doesn't count for anything? No way to put the order in on the fly?  Evidently not. I know this guy doesn't make the rules so I asked to speak to a manager. Nope. You can't. I absolutely love Origami but this is terrible.

"I ventured into this restaurant today since it has only been opened for less than a week. I was very impressed by the layout and the 'upscale' decor. If you are looking for a 'buffet-type' restaurant, do not bother coming here. The table where I was seated had four built-in hot pots. I have never cooked in a hot pot, and I did not this time. BUT, I will the next time I visit. The staff was wonderful and explained everything about how cooking hot pot worked along with the menu items that complemented this type of cooking. However, I chose Szechuan beef along with a hearty helping of WonTon soup. The spices in both were perfect. Many times, you feel that many restaurants break open a sauce packet or even a meal that they serve you. This was absolutely the best Szechuan beef I ever had. I look forward to going back and attempting cooking in the hot pots! This is a 'must' restaurant tucked back in a strip center. Well worth looking into!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

Those rare facets of ambience are like finding a gold vein in these parts. We opted to dine in the bar and our service was prompt if a little too intrusive and truck-drivey, and the food is generally delicious but not enough to merit its cost. The caesar salad, made in the back ""for the first time"" by our cocktail waitress, didn't impress much. The calamari linguine was delicious and light, and the tri-chocolate mousse tower was a puffy treat, although a bit measley and bland in presentation. The interior, rich with fine art but lacking in panache, could use an update. Running into a feisty old mobster on the patio: priceless.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I ordered the exact same thing, a chimichanga with carnitas and an elderflower margarita. The meat inside the chimichanga had great flavor, but it was tough and over-cooked. I ordered a side of queso because I remembered wanting more on my last visit. The itty bitty cup of queso on my plate cost an extra $2...rip off! The elderflower margarita was better on this visit and I could actually taste the elderflower. Unfortunately, the drink couldn't make up for the food.

They just started prepping my order, even though there were no customers.  Not even a reason or a sorry from these folks.  Needless to say...customer service is not their top priority.  As for the food itself, gyro was mediocre at most.  Gyro was on a pizza dough, not even a pita bread.  Meat was from a frozen box which they microwave and doused with tzatziki sauce to hide the thing they call ""meat"".  As I'm typing I just pray that I don't get sick.  Fries were unseasoned and very dry, had to drench them in ketchup and hot sauce for some flavor.   To sum it up, there are so many more pizza places around the Chester Springs/Exton/Lionville area; try those as this place is not worth it.

"Lovers and Madmen is this cute little cafe in Ucity just south of 40th and market. Some of my friends have told me about it so I decided to give it a shot. It is a cute place with a nice and open floor plan with plenty of outlets (which is always good if you want to be seen doing work). Lovers did remind me a bit of 12th St. Cafe, so if you have been there, that's pretty much what this place looked like.  Walking in I was greeted by a nice gentleman who was quite helpful. I was in a bit of an indecisive mood so he ordered me a latte with a chocolate chip muffin. To be honest, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, but the coffee I felt was just average. The muffin was really good though. I was also a bit disappointed when the employee said they didn't have a hot kitchen because I wanted a breakfast sandwich (this is really my fault since I should have looked before hand).   Anyway, Lovers was a decent place that I would give another shot at since I didn't have the quiche which seems really popular.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

My friend and i planned on going to datz but it was an hr and a half wait so we drove half a mile to this place. It has a really small waiting area inside. Noone is there to help you when you walk in then the manager who takes names and seats people seem really stressed out and when we asked how long was the wait they said its the shortest wait in south tampa about ten minutes which turned into 20. Then we got cute mason jars of orange juice with no straws...they dont serve mimosa. I got an eggs benedict and it was good. I ordered take out of ham crepe and they forgot my side which really ruined the whole dining experience for me. If your a waiter check the box for all items dont rush do it right. Guess its my fault i didnt check the box before i left but wow give me a break. If i checked first id have to complain and that is the most annoying thing to remind someone to do...care about people and their job. Common example of hire more help. They clearly dont work well as a team at this place.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I love Vietnamese food and when I have a craving for it, Asian Pho is my go to although it's the furthest from my home. For those who don't know me I don't mind traveling anywhere for great food. Please Note: **The five stars is strictly for the food.** I have always had good service, but I come with my half Vietnamese friends so I'm not sure if that's why. Based on other reviews, service here is hit or miss. I generally visit on Saturdays or Sundays so I can order their special the Bahn Xeo  since they are only offered those two days and I always have to have a bowl of their delicious pho. There is something about their broth that keeps me coming back. For those who don't really like pho, they also offer combo plates with rice with generous portions of meat and rice.

"Went last night, first time ever to Angells. The evening started out fine but then took a turn for the worst! Our waiter came back 3 times and asked us what we had ordered and we did not get our food for an hour. My husband ordered a beer and 30 minutes later still had not received it! Because they could not apparently keep track of our orders, by husbands expensive tenderloin was not cooked to how he had requested and so he hardly ate any of it! To top it off, the 2 tables around us were seated quite a bit after us, were upset due to the wait and the owners catered to them, however they had gotten their food and dessert before we even got served our food! We were there before them and the last to leave! And the owners never acknowledged our wait but pretty much ignored us! THEN, our tab was wrong and had to be corrected TWICE!

"One of the few things about Yelp that I'm not a big fan of is that you can only post one review.  If I go somewhere multiple times, I get one review.  I did give this place a positive review at one time but those days are done and here is the true review.  At my first attempt to place an order, Lucky Palace failed miserably.  I gave my address and phone number very slowly and clearly and after being asked multiple times to repeat the information, my information was repeated back to me and it's almost like the person wrote down their interpretation of what I said.  In frustration, I hung up.  However, we needed dinner so my wife called and placed our order.  I could hear her in the other room repeating our address 11-teen time times and it still surprises me after an hour our food showed up.  Once our food showed up, we thought we were in the clear.  Personally, I ordered a Dinner Combo #3.  Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pork Fried Rice, (Greasy-ass) Egg roll and Fried Shrimp.  After paying for our food, I began plating.  I kept telling my wife how odd it was I didn't get rice.  I went back online to see if I should have received rice and surprise, I should have received rice.  My wife called to ask where the rice was and was told they didn't believe we actually placed an order because they didn't know what our ticket number was.  WHAT??!?!?!?!?!?!!?  ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!?!?!  I'M HOLDING A STICKING RECEIPT!!!!!  After the fail of a call, my wife informed me she didn't know if we were getting the rice we ordered.  F!  F!  F!  Don't ever order from this place unless you want to over pay for mediocre food and not get everything you paid for.  Starving is a better idea than ordering from here......

My salad was small but it served its purpose and the fries were extremely good.   Our servers were very attentive so thankful that we were not trapped there for hours like we would have been at the other restaurant.

Just after our appetizers arrived, we were told the kitchen had actually closed at 8pm and we needed to order our entrees.  We did so, and to their credit, they were tasty.  We were offered dessert, but it was clear they were ready for us to leave.  We were seated near the kitchen, and we even heard a staff member say, "" the last order can't come in soon enough.""  We walked out of Oak at 8:50pm, and I've never eaten at a steakhouse in one hour.

"Great ambience, delicious Mexican mocha, friendly employees!  I discovered Chapterhouse earlier this year, and fell truly, madly, deeply in love. I came with some friends who swore it was an awesome place to get some work done, and I was very skeptical that it was worth it, since it's quite a trek from my home. Turns out, they were right.  Ambience/Space: Very spacious. There is a lovely room in the back of the cafe that is quiet and has a lot of windows allowing natural sunlight to flood into the room. This room faces some greenery and the owner's dog sometimes comes in and out the back door, evoking the sense of retreating to a countryside house. Lots of outlets and you can't really hear the music, so it's perfect for some intense studying. The other parts of the cafe are a bit more active, so they're good for either catching up with a friend or casual reading/studying. The walls showcase the art of local artists. Charming and cozy, and I love that I can bring my dog here to join me.  Food & Beverages: The coffee drinks come in a wide-mouth cup, and the coffee is excellent in flavor. I loved the Mexican mocha. Chapterhouse also serves Audubon macarons, which I highly recommend! They come in a wide variety of interesting flavor combinations and go very fast. I've also tried the olive tuna sandwich, because I have an incredibly soft spot for tuna sandwiches, and I really enjoyed it. The bread was a little thin but the tuna salad was low on mayo, just how I like it.  Service: The baristas are extremely friendly and often engage in conversation with their customers as they wait.

"I love vegetables, but I'm as far from a vegan as one can be. Some dishes are quite tasty. The rutabaga fondue (fauxdue?) was delicious. Most other dishes were tasty, but nothing that would make you think you were eating anything more than side dishes. The eggplant braciole, itself, was delicious, but the pesto served with it was so overpowering, it killed the dish - marinara would improve it by leaps and bounds. The wine list is absurd. Nothing under $62. I don't care how tasty vegetables may be, you don't need to pair an expensive wine to enjoy them. I didn't see a single table (and it was packed) with a bottle of wine. Vedge should completely revamp the wine list with affordable wines. The zucchini bread pudding, the cheesecake and the non-dairy I cream were all very good - the bread pudding was a standout.

(Sorry, gotta keep it real)   The pricing is decent and they open pretty late, which makes it a great stop for a quick snack after a late drop off at the train or bus station nearby.   While you are not going to unravel the very best of dim sum experiences here, it is a reliable place for all the popular options, like soup dumplings, pork dumplings, shrimp dumplings, HK style shumai, etc...",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"the only reason i'm giving this three stars is because the bus boy named Terry was the most attentive person. Our waiter straight up didn't come to our table once so Terry took it upon himself to serve us himself. Honestly he deserves a promotion. He did everything our waiter didn't do. I kid you not we sat there for about 20 minutes before we realized the waiter wasn't coming so we asked Terry to help us and he ended up just taking our table. There were plenty of tables open and still people waiting in the back, and honestly the food was not worth the hassle. Willie maes was wayyyy better. I'm very disappointed.

She asked her if she worked at the nail salon and when she told her she isn't from here the lady said ""oh you all look alike"". WTF i would literally never say something like that to ANYONE.

If I could give 3.5 stars I would. This Cheesecake Factory is pretty solid. Obviously there's nothing unique about the menu but there's definitely something for everyone!  We were seated relatively quickly and our server was great. We had the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer. Pretty standard issue fare.   I liked that we asked for just the brown bread and they happily obliged!  I love the strawberry lemonade and this one was made perfectly!  For dinner I had the crusted chicken Romano which is my old standby. One order is enough for two meals!

Seriously the place is small but we move 1 foot over so it could be convenient for our waitress. Now for the food the pizzas were bland no flavor  at all! We ordered both the white and the margarita.

"Epic Fajita FAILURE!  Wednesdays are BOGO Fajita's for $12 and I left feeling like we paid too much ;)   Chicken and 'steak' combo - both were completely unseasoned and tasted like they had been pre-cooked, no sizzling hot plate of fresh cooked meat just yucky gristly steak scraps, warm chicken, and a lot of mushy onion (did they boil it or wtf?). Should have known something was up when our meals were delivered 2 minutes after ordering. Don't expect a lot of the typical fajita accompaniments that make fajita's fun - you will get 1 tablespoon of 'pico de gallo', 1 tablespoon of sour cream, 1 tablespoon of shredded cheese, 2 tablespoons of shredded lettuce, and a few tortillas to eat your sad 'fajitas' with. If you are willing to pay extra you might piece together something that resembles a fajita ($1 extra for guacamole, $3 extra for salsa) but they would still taste horrible. And if you want to feel full you could pay $3 extra to get a side salad and $1 extra to get rolls but by then you might as well have ordered a real meal ;)  Cody's, I'm embarrassed for you and me - I feel stupid for making a special trip to get fajitas.

The problem is the service or lack thereof.  The staff generally has a somewhat surly attitude and we have never felt welcome. Yesterday, I waited at the counter to be seated but even though waiters came by us numerous times, nobody acknowledged our presence. Finally someone at the cash register simply said ""wait a minute and I will be with you"" - no hello or apology. People that were seated after us did receive their drink order before ours arrived and the same happened with the food - even though we both had the same waitress.

The menu has changed a little, and now they offer both ""tangy"" and ""spicy"" sauce. Personally, I think the meat is so good it needs very little sauce, if any!

I can make a better peach cobbler and I'm not even a cook.  There were not many choices from the buffet.  The food was not delicious and definitely not worth the price we paid.

Then once we get to our table...we stand around for a while...at a table with not enough chairs or place settings...finally we sit down (still only 3 place settings for 8 people) the waiter brings water takes our drink order and delivers our drinks. Not overly friendly but thats ok. We order our food, which by the way didn't come with soups or salad and considering the price, it should have. So while we wait for our food (which took forever) we notice there is no bread...What Italian restaurant doesn't give bread?? We politely ask a different waiter that walks by and he does eventually bring it  (about 2 minutes before our food comes).

"I wanted to take a moment to share my recent experience at Café Madeleine on Mother's Day for anyone thinking about making a reservation for a special occasion.   Back in January when I was looking for ideas on what to do for Mother's Day, I came across their website and loved the idea of dining at the Palm Piper House in Tower Park. I called to inquire and was sold on the experience that myself and my family would receive by booking for the special holiday. At the time the lady who took my reservation, said that I was one of the first callers to make reservations and took all of my information - this was a very easy and pleasant process.   Fast forward a few months to April, and it dawned on me that I had not received a confirmation or phone call reminder for my reservation so I called to double check. I left a voicemail which was promptly returned confirming that they had us on the list. When we arrived it was cold and rainy, nothing I was too concerned about because I was under the impression that we would be inside the historic greenhouse. Much to my surprise, we checked in and were shown to an outside table next to one shared space heater. The atmosphere was dreary, cold and extremely disappointing. Maybe on a nicer day, dining outside would have been fine had we been given the option but not in a forced setting. I politely went back to the check in area and addressed the seating arrangement with the gentleman. I realized at that time, it was a moot point as the seating arrangement was decided in advance; however, I told him of my disappointment and shared my feedback. He mentioned that upon reserving my reservation, I was told that I'd be outside which I explained was not the case. How could I have been told when I originally made the reservation in January? And on top of that, when I called to confirm no one told me about the fact I'd be seated outside - otherwise I would have requested inside seating or possibly even cancelled my reservation. It was not mentioned once, not even as a potential option. When I booked the reservation and when I arrived I was lead to believe that I would be inside.   I went back to my table with my family, in the cold and tried to make the best of our disappointing start. Our server was not friendly, maybe she could sense we were not happy being outside but none the less she was unprofessional. We started by asking for coffee, my husband requested a hot tea for me as I am not a coffee drinker. She proceeded to say that the water was only lukewarm and that she wasn't sure if that would work - we asked for the tea anyway. It never came, so I ordered an iced tea instead. We requested more cream and sugar multiple times, and she seemed irritated even telling us to stop asking because she had it coming, but it look over 15 minutes for it to arrive (not acceptable). I've been to many restaurants and catered events before, this was by far one of the worst servers that I've had. Maybe she was not in a good mood for her own reasons, but she definitely reflected it in her work. To be fair, she left us alone after the initial drink order - we rarely saw her again until the end at which point she was more pleasant than the beginning of the meal. I did encounter other more friendly and professional staff members, so I know that this must have just been bad luck for us. The food selection, quality and taste was on point - because of this our experience wasn't a total bust and the only reason I gave 2 stars. Action stations were great and special shout out to the staff members manning them as they were enjoyable and friendly. Everyone did a good job with making sure there were fresh items replenished when they ran out and overall we were very happy about the food.   That being said though, at the end of the day we paid for the experience of dining at the Palm Piper House and at best we got a small glimpse of what it would have been like walking through on the way to pay the bill.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"So first off, I pulled up to the Hendersonville location and saw a older guy with blonde hair smoking a cigarette and was putting it out as me and my son were walking in. I watched him as he turned the corner of the cook's line and went straight to the register to take my order. He didn't even wash his hands, but I bit my tongue. Restaurant was completely empty (which at lunch time should have told me something). I ordered a Ruben with no sauerkraut, my son had a Italian with no onions or mushrooms, and a Plan ham turkey and bacon sandwich for my other son. I had to explain it like 3 times before they seemed to understand (I thought). Granted my order was a little complicated, but it wasn't that crazy.   I get home and open my sandwich...my Ruben was just corned beef, no Swiss or 1000 island. The ham, bacon, & turkey had lettuce tomato and some yellow dressing. I just spend $50 on our order so I decided to call. Had to leave a massage. Someone called me back and so I started my rant. And yes, I was upset. I started by telling him that no team member should ever be seen smoking in front of their restaurant while on the clock. He interrupted and said, ""the customer smokes there?""  Really???  The customer isn't getting paid for a clean place to eat! YOU ARE!  You are a representation of Pen Station.  Then I asked, ""are you the manager?""  He said no, the guy you saw smoking is. Wait What???!!  Why am I talking to you?  I need to speak to your manager.  So now I'm talking to the manager, he was very calm and offered to remake my order. He claimed he watched his hands after smoking, but I watched him from the time he walked into the building until he came to the register. Not even sanitizer. And then gave me a hollow apology (if your offended about the smoking, then I apologize). Dude!!!!  If you are the leader of this team, you must lead by example.   After talking to the team member and the manager, I will not be back. I managed in restaurants for over 30 years, never have I seen this kind of behavior. And it's not about the smoking, I smoked for years. But I never smoked in front of my guests, and I washed my hands Every time. It's fact the order was wrong and behavior is unsanitary. For the amount of money you spend there...save your money for Jersey Mikes. And it's a shame too. This Used to be my favorite sub spot.

"I love Chipotle's product. I like the fresh, natural approach to foods and love how Chipotle is on-board with these views of food (lots of people may not know how high quality Chipotle's ingredients are). Even though I love the food, I'm not a huge fan of this location. I've been a couple times and both times its been dirty and messy - even when its not busy.

The food was gorgeous, excellently cooked, and really tasty, I especially liked their 'dirt' menu, I changes every day and I wanted to try everything on the menu. They have an extensive drinks menu. BUT..... It was my first time there, and my first 'welcome' was ' your 5 minutes late and if there rest of your party are not here in 5 minutes the kitchen closes' this was at 9:35.

"This place reminds me of Harley Davidson.  Instead of creating great cycles they now focus on T shirts.  They seemed super proud of the whole hog so that's what I got.  Zero especial. I wish my flip phone was cooperating so I could show you the pic.  When I've got whole hog other places you get some crispy skin, this was just like pulled shoulder. Prices high for what you get.  The mac n cheese is str8 noodles and government cheese, no roux needed here.  This place def. more focused on atmosphere and micro brews than the the meat. If you're from out of town do not go here for fire chue, cause it ain't here.  I had to use so much sauce.

"I'd been itching to go here for about a year, as it was recommended highly by friends and colleagues.  Coming in with high expectations and anticipating portions similar to those of Dmitri's and Audrey Claire, I was suprised how tiny the portions were for the price. The Zeus Plate read like a feast on the menu, but on the table each appetizer sample was 1/3 the size of my fist (except for 1/2 plate full of fried calamari, which neither of us wanted).  Still, the food is flavor-packed.  Delicious octopus (but not as good as Dmitri's or Audrey Claire) and juicy charred chicken.  The baba and hummus were also scrumptious.    The BYOB restaurant has many rooms with nooks and crannies for tables large and small, for communal or intimate gatherings.  Our server was awesome and amiable.

"While staying in Philadelphia's Fishtown, I was staying walking distance from Heffe and came across it Saturday night while checking out the neighborhood. It's outdoor, so I imagine I came at the best time because the weather was nice and calm. This probably won't be the best place to check out in the winter. Also note that this place is cash only, theres an ATM on site, but save yourself the $3 fee and come prepared.   The menu was small, but had some solid options. I was stuck between ordering the Kracken or the Almost Pastor. I ended up with the pastor tacos. For the price, I thought the taco size was a really good value for the money. My tacos were stuffed with meat. Two tacos left me really full. Are these super authentic Mexican tacos? Nah. But it's a solid choice if you're in the neighborhood and it's late and you want to end your night out with some tasty food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"Yeah, no. This is my second visit. It's a no for me. I'm in the area and have a taste for veggies a la soul food. I also needed to balance my sugar levels before getting hangry.  There are a few folks sitting scattered around the restaurant. The hostess/waitress get me seated and takes my drink request. Then I watch her flutter from table to table like a hummingbird delivering and picking up various items disappearing into the back periodically. She comes to get my order. I choose a veggie plate with side SALAD. Away she goes flutter flutter flutter. I'm 15 minutes in by now. It's dim even by juke joint standards so I'm by a window. Five minutes and the ""salad"" comes-this is not a salad. A deconstructed wedge of lettuce, 4 croutons, and a table spoon of blue cheese dressing. No tomato, no slivers of carrots just lettuce. I overlook it in anticipation of the meal. Twenty-five minutes in I'm done picking in the wedge. And ask that my food be placed in a to go container. She apologizes and goes to get the container and food. I'm still optimistic. What could go wrong with green beans, steamed broccoli, and pontilly potatoes? Well I had to eat a great bit of it to keep my sugar levels balanced however the salt in the green beans and potatoes surely raised my blood pressure. The broccoli was not salty instead soggy from boiling not steamed.

They were getting really cranky so we figured we better find food pronto. The most convenient thing was the Arbys. I really wish we would have kept walking.  The food didn't taste that bad - the normal Arbys stuff and the staff was decent, but the place was just filthy. A couple of us had to use the restroom, which is located on the 2nd floor. We walked up the stairs to an empty second floor, which had no air conditioning. It was hot and musty and just downright dirty. Only to find that we needed a key, so had to trek back down to get a key. The bathrooms also were no treat.  Everything was dirty - the tables, the chairs - everything.

"Evidently this local chain has found the lock on very enthusiastic and peppy hosts and waiters. It's almost breathtaking how exuberant they are, though it's so much one begins to wonder how much of that is genuine. No matter, the visit is for food. Inside, though the parking lot is very funky, is pretty comfortable and has all the usual trappings you would normally expect for this kind of place.  The food, however...this is the second location I've eaten at and I feel pretty confident in saying that I won't be returning to another by choice. It's not that there's anything wrong, per se, just that one can definitely do a lot better on the Mexican side of things around town. It's not low grade or low rent or anything, but doesn't seem to be reaching for the stars to any great extent, either. It's AN option, somewhere you could hit if you were around, say.   I played it safe and went with nachos this time and this was not one of the better versions I've had of this or the chorizo that was on it. I have, however, also definitely had lesser versions of both, so I guess this falls in the gap. All in all, everything I've had at both locations has just been kind of ""there"" more than anything else.

"Went there with gf, and we were both very disappointed after wanting to go there since they opened.  I had the 3 meat combo (ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket) and she had the vegetarian chilli.  All 3 meats were very bland and not very hot temperature-wise.  The ribs were not fall-off-the-bone, and the brisket was very fatty.  The pork was ok, but bland. Her chilli was very acidic, too much canned tomatoes and not very interesting or flavorful.  We told the chef this when he came out, and his reply was a weak ""well, I'll have to change the chilli recipe"" and he had no reply for the comments about the meats.  The cornbread was cold and a bit stale.  I've had BBQ from the deep south to Texas, and this was some of the blandest I've ever eaten.  We had even stopped by once before to get the take-out roasted chicken, but even though it was around 5pm, they told us none of the chickens would be ready for an hour.

Our entries were vegetable chow mien and basil chicken.   I pictured tasty pan fried noodles  with common Asian restaurant veggies- broccoli, peppers, cabbage, beans , onions, etc.  The veggie chow mien had onions.  And more onions.  In fact, I don't think we had any other vegetables than onions.  The noodles were thin and dry---seemingly pan sizzled vermicelli to the point where they were browned.   The other entire was basil chicken.  The scent of the dish was much like a manly seafood.  Visually, the pale chicken looked nothing like chicken, just curly chunks of something.  Like the veggies from our chow mien, the dish seemed to be missing a key ingredient-basil.  Probably less than five little leaves.  The ""basil"" chicken not only smelled like seafood but came swimming in a puddle of seasoned, gooey oil-yuk. I really want to like this place but the food is gross and is way overpriced.

Nothing wrong with that but it's something I would be super impressed with at a backyard barbecue as opposed to a specialty food stop. I would love to know where they get their actual hot dogs. I was looking for that snap but it's just an average dog with above average toppings. I live in Denmark for a year and their take on the Danish dog is quite accurate minus the actual wiener.

"So the thing is I LOVE TRATTORIA MARCELLA. It's in my top 5 of favorite St. Louis restaurants. Even though I live in West County I had only been to Mia Sorella (the sister restaurant) once 4-5 years ago. I met my best friend for dinner on a Monday night and when we walked in there wasn't a seat to be had in the bar and I thought we were going to have to wait but we were sat immediately and there were only about 3 tables full in the dining room. Turns out they do a huge happy hour business. We tore into the bread service, which was excellent, while we looked over the menu. I really appreciate when a restaurant serves butter at the correct temperature. No one wants solid butter that doesn't spread! Of course they got that right here. I ordered the Insalata Mista (Mixed Lettuces, Red Onion, Artichoke, Parmigiano, Red Wine Mustard Vinaigrette) and the Rigatoni al Amatriciana (Thick Cut Bacon, Onion, Red Chili, Tomato Sauce, Grated Parmesan.) My dinner date ordered the nightly special salad and the Whole Wheat Spaghetti and Roasted Veggies. I loved my pasta. The bacon was still crisp and the onions were caramelized and had a bit of sweetness. Also the rigatoni was perfectly al dente. I would absolutely order this again. My friend loved his pasta as well but I never got a bite! The dining room was almost full by the time we left and the service was friendly and fairly speedy. I'm really glad we chose Mia Sorella.

"Went the other night with a group of friends. It was busy even though it was a wed night. The hostess said about 20 mins for a wait so we went to the bar. It ended up being about 20 mins or a little less so awesome estimation on her part! We all ordered a drink, which took a bit because the bar was busy and looked to only have 2 bartenders. This bar is massive and I feel like they almost need 3 to keep up.  I ordered the blood orange margarita and it was awesome. I enjoyed it so much I ordered a second after we sat down at the table. Heads up! It took us about 7-10 mins to get our drinks at the bar, but about 15-20 mins to get them at the table. Order early.   Our waiter was super friendly and gave good suggestions. The vibe was really fun and relaxed. My only complaint is that the table we were sat at had the ac on full blast right down on the table. I mean, hair blowing in the wind powerful. I was freezing and had to sit on the other side of the table because of how it was angled so I didn't get the majority of it. I'm cold natured, but my friends weren't and they were cold too. Maybe need to adjust that vent somehow to accommodate this or move the seating so it's not directly on the table by the (what looks like a) buffet table.   About the food. I loved the chips and salsa! And I'm not a chips and salsa girl. The chips are perfectly cooked and thin (think chuys) and the salsa is fresh. I also enjoyed the cheese/meat/guacamole dip that we got for a starter. I definitely recommend that.   For the meal I ordered a mix/match of the Steak and pork tacos. They came with beans and had really good flavor, but man, they were fatty cuts of meat. The tacos were bigger than the street taco size and were stuffed full which was great, but the actual meat inside was about 60% fat. I know I'm picky about meat in general preferring the leaner cuts, but the way they serve their tacos is with big chunks cut up. With the big cuts the large amount of fat is not appealing to bite into. The flavor of the taco is already there. I would have preferred a less impressive smaller taco with only good cuts of meat to the larger one with all the fat. This was with both the pork and the beef so I know it wasn't just one type. But to bring it back around, the flavor was there and I enjoyed the veggies in the pork taco (including pineapple...yum!)  All in all I'd come back here but I want to try the outside patio, gorge on chips and blood orange margaritas, and maybe try a vegetarian or chicken option.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The space looks nice and clean and has ample indoor and outdoor seating.  The decorations are sparse and mostly blend in with the space. A flower box or two outside would really spruce up the experience.  My sister and I split a margarita pizza and a small chicken ceaser for lunch and were really happy with our choices.  The pizza is a wood oven pizza and the ceaser was tasty and came with polenta croutons. We came back for brunch and had an equally nice experience.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
This is one of the most beautiful restaurant spaces in New Orleans! The food is absolutely amazing and definitely did not disappoint. The service still has a few kinks to work out- it seemed that the wait staff was under- supported for the size of the restaurant. It was also a bit weird to invest in multiple burlesque dancers (which honestly I could do without while eating dinner) walking around plus a DJ when there aren't enough people to serve.

"My husband and I really enjoyed this place! Upscale vibe in kind of an interesting location, but don't let the location scare you away from great food. The ambiance is modern with lots of cool Tucson photos, which I love. The bathroom is really cute too, so kudos to whoever decorated!  I started with the margarita flight which was so fun! They have a ton of interesting craft margs so the flight gives you the chance to sample a few of them- great idea!   Our food was delicious. Many of the dishes are authentic ones from different parts of Mexico, but they also have your traditional combo choices and tacos if that's what you're into. We LOVED our food. I ordered the Birria and my husband ordered the torts. So many flavors and a great portion size. Their creamy rice side is one I would recommend. Now I should say we liked our food a lot but don't have the authentic Mexican dishes to compare to. I've never had Birria or a torta before, so I can speak to how it would compare if this is a dish you are familiar with.  Our desert was also delicious- the crema azteca! A great way to end a wonderful meal that was too filling.  Our service was a little slow but the server herself was very knowledgeable and had great recommendations and descriptions for a couple gringos who wanted everything on the menu. I would be curious how it would be if it was a full house on a Friday or Saturday, as this was a Wednesday night.  I would definitely go back to try some more margs and fun, authentic dishes.  Bottom line: Another Mexican joint in Tucson that's worth a try for some fun flavors of Mexico!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

The food and the service are consistently good.   This past Sunday, we had Tim as our server. He was friendly and very attentive.   My companion had the veggie omelet and he wolfed it down within minutes. I had the pancakes, poached eggs, bacon, and corned beef hash. Everything tasted delicious.

"It pains me to leave a negative review of Ratchada because this used to be my favorite Thai restaurant in the city! Unfortunately, the last few times my husband and I have eaten there or gotten takeout we have been really disappointed and I truly hate to see them going downhill!   I have been eating there for over 10 years and always have highly recommended them to other people. I even had my 40th birthday party there! But I heard that they are now under new management - perhaps they also have a new chef. All I know is that something significant has changed because the care and quality has definitely dropped.   My husband and I recently ordered takeout from them, despite having a disappointing experience the time before but we thought that was just a fluke. Unfortunately it now looks more like a trend.  The food was disappointing and not up to the standards we have come to expect from them. We ordered the Laos sampler and ALL of it was undercooked. The Laos sausage was actually disgusting because no one wants to eat undercooked pork. The beef jerky was not even reminscent of jerky - it was just...seasoned beef with no chewiness whatsoever. And the spring rolls were SOGGY! And they gave us no dipping sauce which always came with it in the past. We also got the Chu che duck which ordinarily we love. The sauce was still great but the skin on the duck was somewhat lacking in crispiness. Finally we ordered the lemongrass fried rice with shrimp. Somehow, even this was not as good as in the past. The rice was clumpy and the flavors just weren't there as in the past.   Also, WHY oh WHY would they get rid of the Laab Tuna????!!!!! It was literally one of the best things on the menu - perhaps one of my favorite dishes anywhere in the city and for some reason they have completely done away with it. They don't even offer it as a special anymore.  I have called and begged them to put it back on the menu to no avail. I miss the old Ratchada. Please bring it back! I'm really hoping they can turn things around there because I would love to try them again and give a glowing review. I just can't right now.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Late lunch at the Cactus was a slightly strange experience for me.  Nothing was bad, or wrong per se, but I left with a bitter taste in my mouth so let me describe it in detail.  We were seated quickly and ordered watermelon mint margaritas. These were great. Then came the chips and salsa.  The salsa is a fire-roasted type...dark red and the food processor/blender style (not pico de gallo chunky, but not hot sauce smooth, if you know where in the middle I'm referring to). The flavor was decent, not spicy enough for my taste, but good, except here is where things started getting weird. The salsa was hot. I mean temperature hot.  Like sitting in the sun for a long time, recently cooked and left to cool, resting near an oven hot.  Now, maybe you don't find this weird, but as someone who has eaten Mexican food at least once a week for oh, say, 25 years (I'm from Texas people, it's like seafood to Louisianans), I have very rarely experienced a warm salsa.  So rarely in fact, that I couldn't even tell you when it has happened..though this style of salsa is one that can be served warm I suppose.  This obviously left me affronted and unsure of the upcoming meal, if you couldn't tell.  We decided to order queso, because well, who doesn't like queso?  Theirs is alright--about the same temperature as the weird warm salsa (which worked out great for mixing them together...).  For entrees, we got the taco salad and shrimp quesadillas and split both.  The salad was pretty meager in size--more like a side portion anywhere else, but in a giant taco shell bowl and with maybe what amounted to a 3 ounce portion of chicken on top.  The cilantro lime dressing was very good though--if there had been a decent amount of lettuce to put it on, I probably would have loved the salad.  The quesadilla was cheeeeeeeeeesy.  Where are the rest of the ingredients cheesy. Hey I thought this had vegetables cheesy. I guess unseasoned boiled shrimp and two pieces of mango tastes good with cheese cheesy. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good--simple solution: season your shrimp. Chargrilled seasoned shrimp are great in Mexican food, just FYI. Minimal mango can also be forgiven for good shrimp. And it doesn't come with sides--it's pretty big so I guess this is ok...  Nevertheless, we devoured our halves of everything. And then the check came.  We just had two drinks, an appetizer, half a quesadilla each and an ""entree size"" salad so hey the pricetag of 60 bucks isn't unexpected--except we aren't very full..and there are no leftovers...and the salsa was warm....and did I just pay 12 dollars for a side salad?  I think you get it. Or I hope you do.  The atmosphere is great. I am desperate for outdoor dining in New Orleans and it hits the mark, but the food and prices leave you wanting more.  Perhaps Velvet Cactus should take a note from the Chuy's chain in Austin--similar vibe, but prices and quality that keep you coming back even though its cliche tex-mex.   I wouldn't advise you against going here, but I probably won't be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"My New Years brunch here was a discombobulated affair, and not because we were partially rested and recovering from an alcohol-induced stupor. The effort here was devoid of enthusiasm and the brunch game was D-level, if that.  Bread offering: wtf? This is not the White Dog I used to know. The two of us received three minuscule squares of different breads, accompanied by whipped butter. Tasty, but paltry, and a far cry from the teeming bread basket basket that I fondly remember from the original location.  Steak and eggs: the steak was average in flavor and lacked tenderness. It literally could not be destroyed. The breakfast potatoes were tasty and cooked perfectly. The eggs were eggs, which would have been fine if the steak had been ace.  Ham and cheese crepes with porcini sauce: these sounded like a good idea but in reality were bizarre and mega-unappetizing. The three thin crepes were dry and clearly had been sitting under a heat lamp. They were topped with broken sauce that was the color of terra cotta, along with limp, undressed arugula. I tasted a vague suggestion of mushroom, but that's it.  Truffle fries: the fries themselves were decent but I've had better. The chipotle aioli served alongside them was a total mismatch. Truffle and chipotle have no business being together as a couple. Ew. To add insult to injury, the aioli had a skin on top, probably from sharing a heat lamp with those nasty crepes.  The one redeeming course? Cinnamon sugar beignets arrived piping hot, delicious, and accompanied by a sweet glaze for drizzling (or dipping).   Maybe their brunch game is the only thing amiss. I was so fond of the original University City White Dog, though, and this lackluster, overpriced meal made me sad for my tummy and wallet. Hard pass.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"We liked Steve's.  A lot.  With some of the negative Yelp reviews we almost passed it by.  That would have been our loss. Because inside the cheerful storefront we found warm greeting at the door, sparkling bright  ""all people are welcome here"" ambiance, good food  with many items house made, a menu with options for vegetarians to omnivores and it seemed for those who eat gluten free or vegan too, very fair prices, breakfast served all day (yahoo for that) and super efficient and friendly service.  The sign outside says ""Breakfast and Lunch among Friends"".  That's just what it felt like inside. We will be back.   FOOD Noting the owner's surname is Italian (Vincelli), my hubby (whose name ends in a vowel too) asked if the Italian sausage was homemade.  Yep.  And so is the chorizo and so is the chicken apple sausage.  The Italian variety is on his ""to try"" list for next time.  I appreciated that among the extensive menu of breakfast offerings they had a handful of great options for ""lighter fare"", which means things like half portion of Eggs Benedict or Classic Breakfast.  Nice.  The kitchen got my poached egg just right (and I order them in completely non PC  'well done' format which is tough for kitchens to do), the bacon was crispy (and enough to share), the biscuit (baked each morning) was fluffy and the hash browns were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and not one iota greasy.    My hubby liked his huckleberry pancakes and the huckleberry syrup that came with them was just sweet enough and not too much so it tasted like fresh berries.  The short stack was more than enough to fill him up.  They grind their own coffee beans and the coffee cups were kept filled with a good medium roast brew.  PRICES Seemed more than reasonable for the food quality and serving sizes.  In our case, breakfast for two with two coffees came in at about $18.00.  Deduct the beverage and for food alone you'd be under fifteen bucks.  A very good value.  AMBIANCE Booths line the walls and in front of the window.  Formica tables with wood chairs are in the rest of the space and are thankfully spread far enough apart to avoid ""sardine can"" seating for diners and too tight squeeze getting to and from for diners or staff.  There are also a few stools at an open counter.  At the 'shoulder time' between breakfast service and lunch all the booths were taken and just a couple of tables with folks who all seemed as if local regulars.   SERVICE Topt notch, from greet and seat through order and eat they hit every beat.  We asked several questions about items on the menu and our delightful server could answer every one.  THIS N THAT:  1) STRIP MALL LOCATION / PARKING:  Steve's is tucked off of Fairvew in a little strip mall and can be a bit tough to spot at first.  The benefit of the location is an ample sized parking lot.  2) ACCESSIBILITY:  Level in the door and throughout the space.  Ample standard height seating.  Accessible parking in the lot.  3) WOULD RACISM FLY IN YELP REVIEWS?:  I'm wondering if a reviewer commented in assigning a two star review that he saw too many people inside Steve's with Mexican or Asian heritage and went on to outline stereotypes if that would fly as ""funny"" in reviews?  I bet not.  I'd find it obnoxious.  So why is it a Yelp review where a leading criticism offered up in a snarky way was that there were too many older people dining at Steve's on the day the reviewer was there a funny review...at least in ""Yelp votes""?  Ageism is like racism in my book. Neither one is  funny.   And no matter how hard that Yelper may try, he's gonna be in that population one day.  These older folks are people who helped keep the world safe and the economy fueled in their day.  Should we expect they stay home from a neighborhood cafe?  Please.  And yep, getting close to that age myself, I take it personally.  Enough said.  4) THANKS DUE: to Yelper Carl Y and his spouse because it was their good mention of Steve's that led us to ignore the two star reviews.  Otherwise, we may not have ventured in.  We're glad we did.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"We went there for our anniversary. The view was beautiful. Our waiter was ok. Barely talked to us which wouldn't have bothered me that much, but he was overly talking to the next table. He was very friendly and conversational with their table. I thought it was odd. Anyway, we were there for about 45 minutes before our order was taken. Meanwhile the waiter had been to the other table several times which made no sense. Long story short, we received our food about and hour and a half after we sat down. The food presentation was not good and that was fine but I expected it to be good. It was not. I ordered the beef tenderloin risotto. First the whole meal was really oily. The risotto was too cheesy and didn't taste like risotto. They said it had pancetta in it and I did not taste that. The beef tasted like beef with no seasoning. My husband ordered the Penne Molica on the suggestion of the waiter. His food was even more oily than mine. It seemed like it was bathed in oil. He said it didn't really have a taste. I wanted to complain but it was my anniversary and I didn't want to ruin in. I promised myself that I'd write this review to warn others.

"Just recently began coming to Royal Sushi.. I loved it and it was obvious. On December 29,2021 I went back to Royal s for some of that bomb ass Ramen. This day in particular was pretty packed and we had trouble getting seated initially; we were seated after folk we arrived before. I was not mad nor did I make Royal aware of any of there mishaps, yet. The two tables who got seated around the same time as me got waited on, orders taken, food and drinks came before we were seen once. In the time span between us being seated and acknowledged as customers we had enough time to browse the menu and have our orders ready as soon as we were seen. Finally got waited on we were given 2 waters, ordered 1 large sake 2 bowls of ramen and a sushi roll. The two tables that were seated with us were almost finished their food and our waiter had not been back to check on us or see if we wanted anything else. After sitting there for about 20 minutes getting caught up in conversation and a tad lit off the sake (mainly because our waiter never came refill our water); I had to flag down our waiter.  Problem one.. I shouldn't have to flag down anyone In an establishment where you're expected to spend money and be serviced.  Problem 2.. when I flag you down and ask what's going on with the food.. you go to the computer do whatever you do then come back to the table and say ""you don't know if you explained .. but we are very busy blah blah blah and that itd be a minute..... if we are busy and experiencing longer wait times than usual was the narrative for the night. 2 tables wouldn't have gotten their food within minutes of being seated and I would have heard it from someone's mouth other than his and before I had a problem with the wait. The waiter was rude cutting me off as I'm trying to explain my displeasure with how he's doing his job and this is one of the lowest I've felt as a customer in any establishment.. ever Problem 3 comes where I pay for my food get it bagged to go just to get home and see that my order was wrong. So I call Royal and explain. I try to see if they can just refund my card from over the phone but unfortunately I had to go in.    With their problems getting the best of me as they were doing I felt that just getting comped 15% initially and refunded for something I never got was not enough for me having to drive back to their establishment to get money back for another of their mistakes. The manager will was rude in saying that he wasn't giving me anything other than money for sushi roll.

It might have been an off day when I went but it just didn't live up to expectations based on other reviews.  It was very crowded on a late Saturday afternoon which usually heralds a delicious experience. However we were less than enchanted.  Chao shou dumplings seemed a bit lackluster other than the spicy kick of the sauce.  I had crispy pork platter. It was lukewarm and frankly I have had much better. I know it was cooked way ahead since it takes a while for this but it really didn't have much flavor. The soy sauce on the rice was just meh. That's something I ate as a kid or while in college.  The noodle soups were extremely large but the pickled vegetables are definitely an acquired taste. Broth wasn't anything special. Noodles were cooked just right and that's a plus.  So far this is the least impressive of the Szechwan wave of Chinese restaurants in Tucson in my opinion.

"The constantly rotating crew here never seems to know how to handle transactions like the VIP card or Round the World that every other Scotty's handles with ease. The employees are never around long enough to learn your name and customer service isn't really a priority here.

The hours are horrible (seriously, why have a bar that closes at 11 or midnight?).   Sadly, among the everyday restaurants downtown, this is the best. That speaks more to the lack of options in Indianapolis than the quality of this place. I'm probably one of the most regular customers here and I'd rate it ""Meh"".  This is truly the worst Scotty's in the chain. If you stop here because you're in town, don't let your experience at this location keep you from going to Muncie, Lafayette or Bloomington. Those all have great customer service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Okay, we (my wife and I) generally don't write reviews, specifically bad ones, but this place was BAD!!  We live in Haddonfield and were really very excited to see a burger place in town and were disappointed for a number of reasons.   We went on a Friday night and there were a number of people in there (4 or 5) sitting around. We sat outside and ordered 2 medium burgers, 2 milkshakes and an order of fries to split. The milkshakes came out pretty quickly and were good, not great. I didn't really think about it when I ordered but it dawned on me that the waitress never asked us what temperature we wanted our burgers.  My wife only eats them well and I was hungry after a 10 hour day at work and didn't want to call the waitress back so I figured I would eat it at the temp they brought it out.    About 10 minutes after we placed our order the waitress brought out a basket of fries. She didn't bring ketchup or say anything about how long before the burgers came out. We started eating the fries and they were crispy, not burnt, but incredibly overcooked.  It then took at least another 10 more minutes after the fries were delivered before the burgers came out. My burger was in this odd football shape, not round and only filled up half the bun because of the way it was smashed together, the taste was not good either.  You could tell that there was seasoning placed on it but it was so overcooked it seemed as if the seasoning was burnt. Oh and when we got our burgers they came with a long slice of a pickle. The pickle was all mashed and looked like somebody rode over it with a bicycle. The pickle itself tasted like it had some sore of hot spice on it. When I commented about the taste to the waitress she said she did not like these pickles and her facial said ""yea they are disgusting.""   Oh and those 4 or 5 people that were sitting around inside. It looks like they all actually work there?? When I walked inside to get the ketchup they just laughed and thought it was funny that no one gave it to us. It seems like no one that works there gives a crap about the place and they if something would need to get done they would argue over who actually had to stop watching television and work.   Really, I love small businesses. It's part of what we love about living in Haddonfield and close to Collingswood. But there is NO WAY this place can stay in business for more than 6 months if what I saw tonight was the norm. Really, it seems like a bunch of underachieving 20 somethings got someone to fund their business, or hire them. It's sad and expect the world to come rolling in and order there food. If there is someone who actually cares about turning that place in to a viable business I hope they read this and make some serious changes ASAP. Next time I will just get in the car and drive to Zin Burger if I want a burger",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"For the menu price point our dinner fell way short of expectations. Buffalo Wings appetizer came out with cool inner temp. Sent them back, which server cheerfully did, and they came back out have clearly been nuked and dunked in more sauce. They were now a hot and soggy mess. I ordered the 8 oz Prime rib, medium rare. It arrived with at least 2 oz of fat and gristle running through the center, overcooked on one side, raw on the other - how does that even happen?? Garlic fries were half soggy from something - it this point I was over this meal. My husband's halibut was over grilled to the point of being of stringy texture. At this point HE was done with this restaurant. Server was inattentive and forgetful. Just writing this place off and won't be back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"After one full lot to the next full lot, an hour of circling Decatur for a parking, my boyfriend was frustrated enough to leave downtown. On our way out, he randomly parked at the first parking he saw, which was right outside of Marigny. We decided to try it because we were that hungry. It ended up being one of the best lunches we've experienced downtown. During crawfish season they serve crawfish cakes instead of crab cakes; they were delicious. He ordered the well-known shrimp&oyster poboy with a side of sweet potato fries,  while I opted for something light, the strawberry walnut salad. Our waitress was very helpful and so friendly.

"Soooo good! My wife and I tried this place for lunch for the 1st time today after a recent recommendation from some friends. It's a quaint place located in a strip center that is just killing it with some great little restaurants. Upon entering you make your way to the counter to order from the big board type menu. We were greeted very nicely and he helped to give us a few tips since we are first timers. We ordered, paid & then had a seat at one of the tables to wait for our food. The atmosphere is nice with Spanish music playing and not too over the top.  Our food came out fairly quickly and looked delicious. It did not disappoint. Since we were here for lunch we both ordered the chicken sandwich. One with a side of rice & beans and the other w/ the steak fries. We also had a side of the fried plantains to share. All were excellent. I especially enjoyed the sauces that came on the side. The chicken on the sandwiches and portions for the sides were maybe slightly on the lite side but I definitely didn't leave still feeling hungry. So with that said, I'd say they were just right. We will definitely be back and regular patrons for this place. I look forward to trying more items from the menu. It's just too bad we hadn't given this place a try sooner!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

Our server was very knowledgeable about not only the restaurant and the menu but the area.

"My father and I went here today because we hadn't been to different sushi place (from our regular) in some time.  I had eaten here a year or so beforehand and remembered it as being decent, so we thought it was worth a try.  We were disappointed, to say the least.    I'll start off by saying that our food wasn't bad; we didn't have any of the awful experiences of others.  One roll (Dark Rose) was interesting and something I had never tried before.  Most of the nigiri was fine.  That being said, the food ""quality"" (relative term) is the only thing that prevented me from giving this place a 1-star.  The service here was AWFUL.  We were the only two there when we walked in. The server was nice enough, but not very attentive.  The (only) chef there started rushing us for an order, before we even had a chance to check the menu.  When we'd ask for something, he wouldn't even acknowledge that we'd ordered; he'd just walk over silently.  As soon as he'd set our food down, he'd ask ""What else you want?!""  And I don't mean politely asking ""is there something else I can get you?""; it felt as if he was demanding that we order something more.  If we said we'd need another minute, he'd just turn his back to us.  I asked him about a roll I had ordered at one point, and he just looked at me without responding.  His assistant (after a long awkward silence) reassured me.  Bottom line, it felt like we were an imposition and a chore to the chef the entire time we were there; Storage Wars was much more important to him.  My dad even asked me (half-redundantly) what we had done to offend him.  We don't know.  My last parable to illustrate my point: I wholeheartedly believe in always leaving a tip, and usually 20% as a minimum.  I left ZERO on the tip line, and I used the ""customer copy"" receipt to explain why it was zero: the final line stated ""Tell your chef that we're sorry for ruining his TV time"".  We won't go back.  We're sticking with Hiroba; we seem to be disappointed whenever we go anywhere else.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I had a deal through Ruelala for a wine & cheese/charcuterie pairing at Liberte Lounge. I took advantage of this Thursday night.  Liberte is swanky/cozy with prompt and friendly service.  The waiter warned us that the wine/cheese/charcuterie took about 15-20 minutess to put together, so in the meantime we ordered a round of drinks.  I went with the Liberte cocktail...them shits go down smooooth! Absolutely delicious and I started getting tipsy off one, so they don't skimp on alcohol.  It's pear infused vodka with St. Germain, sparkling wine and lemon with a slice of pear. They're $12 each but worth it.    The bar is a little pricey in general (ex: Victory Prima Pils for $7 - I can get the same in Northern Liberties or Fishtown for $5), but this is to be expected at a swanky hotel lounge in Rittenhouse. I'd return for happy hour, or if I were in center city and in the mood for an upscale comfy bar.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"We stopped by here after an impromptu wedding ceremony at the courthouse for Maria and Shawn.   We had a party of 10 people. Upon first entering the restaurant you can see the huge steel fermenters... Pretty cool having their beer brewed a few feet away from where you sitting! Of course that's if you sit inside.  It was such a nice day so we opted to sit outside on their nice patio overlooking the water.  We all ordered various appetizers:  voodoo chicken flatbread- I'm a pizza fan so might be biased but everyone else said it was really good too. The bacon and red onions really sealed the deal on this BBQ flavored flatbread. Yum?  Korean BBQ chicken wings- it's got a nice kick to them but also a sweetness to balance it.  Ahi tuna poke- this might have been my favorite app out of all the others. Those wonton chips were fresh and crisp! Tuna was delish.   Nasheville hot chicken sliders-like spicy chicken minis (Chick-fil-A) but with BBQ sauce on them. Pretty good.  Fried brussels sprouts- I probably would not have tried this had it just been Dave and I eating out. Not out usual app selection but these were the best I've ever had... Ever. That pecorino romano cheese... Hit the spot! Omg I wanted to eat all of it.  Philly cheese steak egg rolls- unfortunately I didn't get to try it   Fried Rhode Island calamari- the cilantro aioli, lime zest was perfect  Dave and I also shared the pub burger.

It is decked out with beer trinkets and banners with a welcoming vibe.   Our waitress was very nice and attentive. The best thing about this place is the price. It's very cheap. My beer and burgers was probably around $6-7. Not only was my food cheap but it was an amazing burger (for the price)! Next time I go back I will order two.

"Food is three stars at best.  Service was pleasant and deserves 5 stars! We came around closing and they were still happy to serve us, AND they gave us 6 free donuts since they probably would have been thrown away otherwise!   The chips and guac were good, and we enjoyed the jalapeño cheddar sauce. But when the sauce was first served to us it had that filmy look, the way cheese sauce gets when you leave it out too long.  The fish in the fish tacos was nicely prepared, not too dry or anything. But the cole slaw kind of reminded me of something that your mom throws together for a BBQ, but not in a good way. The chicken taco was underwhelming. It could have been canned chicken for all I know.  Food aside, this place has a nice bar and awesome beer list!

"I really do like this place and it's so close to home!  Not only can you get your fair share of pub grub with a higher end twist but you also get some very nice thai-flaired dishes, or a steak....  Drinks are a-flowin', I always stick to my Strongbow - one of the few places that has it, although they only have bottles, not on tap or large cans.  We frequent the place often and except for sometimes the service is lacking in friendliness and recent past chef turnover was a little discerning at first, but they are doing a pretty good job at it keeping some of the best items on the menu and making some changes to others (one item we are not happy about is the tempura shrimp is no longer available - they have a nut-crusted shrimp now and just isn't as good....will just save us from getting too full too soon).  Last visit in this past week, we were visited by the manager and he was very, very nice and at the end of the night - bought our drinks!  WOW!  When does that ever happen anymore? :)  For a great dessert, there's the carrot cake which very good.  But better yet, when they have it (and they only get it when a special lady brings it over) the toffee cake is ever so yummy!  It's truly a treat.  We've also had a couple other of their desserts.

"We ordered this last night for this first time.  Well, it was the first time for 3 out of the 4 eating from ClusterTruck.   Our order consisted of (don't judge us):  Hot chicken sandwich with fries 2 cheeseburgers Loaded tots Breakfast burrito Chips & queso  I like the very diverse menu and I've head good things about this place.  I met the delivery driver at the curb (that's their ""thing) and he was very friendly.  The food looked great!   Here's what worked and what didn't..........  The burgers were very good.  The queso was good.  The tots were good and there were plenty of them.    The breakfast burrito was bland.  Most of it got thrown away.  The hot chicken sandwich was a filler, at best.  There was absolutely NO flavor to it at all.  When I say NO flavor, that's what I mean.  No hint of seasoning, salt, pepper - nothing.  The menu said this was a VERY SPICY sandwich.   Nope.   It wasn't.   There was some residual heat after I finished it so I erred on the side of caution with some heartburn medicine, but probably didn't need it.  Did I finish the sandwich?  Yes, I did.  I'm not going to throw away $10 and I'll take the filler over going hungry.   Some ketchup and mayo helped.  Would I try it again?  Eh, maybe.

I don't understand having to ""sign in"" or whatever to get a wrist band so you can receive lower prices on certain drinks.  Just having ""happy hour specials"" would make things easier.

"They serve the most expensive Mexican style tacos north and south of the Rio Grande. Spent 25.00 for two tacos and a margarita, including the tip. Tacos are 2 for 9.00 and margaritas are 9.00. I was still a little hungry when I left. Thought about ordering another taco but refused to spend more money for a taco dinner. Beans or rice are available at 4.00 each. Please to the math. I dont understand the high mark especially for a restaurant located in Central city.  The best thing served was the smoky tomato salsa that came with the tacos...very delicious! They were out of the goat tacos so I ordered the pork replacement and one lengua (tongue) taco. Both were good but served on one store bought tortilla. One tore down the bottom while eating.  The 1.00 tacos I had last week in Houston were better.   I was really looking forward to eating at Case Borrega and was hoping that it would be a restaurant that I would continue to frequent but that will not happen until they dramatically reduce the prices and stop nickel and diming. I understand the time and cost of running a restaurant and the attention to detail when preparing and cooking food. I have been working in the industry for 20 years. But we're talking about tacos, folks! Roy Choi charges 2.29 for his tacos. Whats up?  I really hope they will figure this out before the newness wears out or someone else in the city decides to make a better and cheaper taco.   The decor was festive and comfortable.

I've never been to a bar before, so I'm not familiar with such procedures. People were very nice.  I'm underage, so I ordered the bottomless home-brewed root beer. It had a very deep taste to it, one that I definitely wouldn't get from A&W (unless it was actually A&W and I fell into their psychological manipulation). $2.95. Nice.  Juices aren't unlimited, and are about $2 per refill.

They take less than 2 minutes to make. When it did come, we were hungry enough to write off the wait. First impression, not enough jalapenos, cheese was almost dried out (maybe it was supposed to be), and chips were decent. This was a very large portion, as expected... it's just nachos... portions are usually large, so we took our sweet time finishing it. It was all right. I guess I'm not used to nacho platters with such crusty cheese. About $12.   The beer was fantastic, according to my friends who could drink.

"Not quite so impressed with my most recent visit, unfortunately. We ordered lunch the other day to go.  We got the Festa (of course), Viviano's salad, and a third item I can't remember the name of, but it consisted of fresh mozzerella, basil, and tomato.  The Festa was awesome as always.  It's a pretty large sandwich, and the Au Jus is perfectly flavorful. The salad was a disappointment.  It was mostly finely chopped lettuce and it had a pretty tasteless vinaigrette dressing.  The mozzerella appetizer was pretty awful. They literally took the previously mentioned ingredients and poured balsamic vinegar all over it.  I just think with a little care, both of these items could be a whole lot better.  I will still go back for the Festa, it is totally worth it.   I have one last concern with my most recent visit.  The older man working in the kitchen.  Yelled out my order number as I was perusing their grocery section.  I assumed it was mine, but looked at my receipt (guess I pulled the wrong one out of my purse).

The noise level inside the restaurant was extremely loud from the grill and venting equipment.  The whole concept of guests(including children) handling raw meat from the selection bar still has me wondering how much bad bacteria is being spread around.  Whoever dreamt up this restaurant concept, didn't fully think it through logically.  I know that I will never return to any Genghis Grill anywhere.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The tenderloin sandwich was probably the best I have had in Indianapolis. The breading is super crunchy and it doesn't hang off the bun a ridiculous amount like normal tenderloins do. We went for lunch and there was no wait, which was surprising because they have such great lunch specials. It was really quick too. I would not recommend the french fries, they are not super chrispy, so if you like chrispy fries you definitely won't like these.   My favorite time to go is happy hour, they have $2, $3, $4 items that make for great snacks after work along with one of their beers. They have a really good selection of draft beers, which I prefer draft over bottles.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
Anytime my wife and I are out of town we like to try the local spots. We were pleasantly surprised not only was the service excellent but our  breakfast was great. The eggs were cooked perfectly to each of our liking and my corn beef hash was so good I was tempted to ask for seconds,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Ordered take out. The salmon was delicious, but unseasoned. The sauce on it was good which helped mask the seasoning. The mashed potatoes were decent. The Matt burger would've been delicious had they not put the sauce on it. The cook was nice. The Thai chili wings were delicious! All in all not a bad meal. Would love to try it in restaurant.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"WOW! Just called, and I mean just. Whom ever answered the phone I asked what would you suggest for a pick up order? The man said, ""I have no idea, I'm really busy, and go look it up online."" He started to give me the website. I hung up on him. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO TAKE AN ORDER, OR SPEAK TO A POTENTIAL CUSTOMER DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE! Do not support this restaurant.

"Our family really enjoyed Riff Burger's, so we were curious to see what the menu changes were that came with the name change.  Boy were we disappointed!  First of all the restaurant suffers from an identity crisis. The roadhouse type cafe and the next store French patisserie share a combined menu, not foods that you normally think of as complimenting each other. My husband and oldest son both ordered a hamburger and both were dry and served on a plain hamburger bun.  The fries, which used to be good, werent even good enough for my 3 year old to eat.  I went for the French side of things and ordered the French onion soup and a side salad.  The broth of the soup was okay, but the onions were kind of crunchy and the bread on top was totally soggy.  Our server was friendly, but I dont think that was enough to get us back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
I cannot say enough great things about this place! From the fun decor to the delicious sushi to the friendly and accommodating staff you will not be disappointed! We went here for the first time tonight and were very impressed. Miso soup is some of the best we've had. I ordered the 2 in 1 spicy roll which was had a nice kick to it as promised! And the Philly roll actually had smoked salmon which a lot of restaurants seem to skimp on these days. Overall the meal and pricing were on point and being only 10 minutes from our house we can't wait to go again!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Two friends of mine and I went here the other night for a light, cheap dinner.  The prices were right, the atmosphere was cozy, and the food was beautiful and tasty.  I, having a craving for the Japanese end, ordered some Udon soup.  In a well-seasoned broth, the thick Udon noodles and its vegetable counterparts floated nicely.  It was a little pricey for a small bowl of soup, but it was well worth it.    One of my friends ordered the Udon soup as well, and was a little disappointed; the portion and the flavors were right, but the noodles were too thick for her liking, and it was hard for her to eat.  I, however, found everything to be spot on.    My other friend went the Korean route, ordering a bento box with spicey chicken.  She found everything to her taste, except that the spicey wasn't spicey enough for her.  The soup, as she tried it, had more of a kick than her spicey chicken bento!  The edamame on the side was split by all three of us, which tasted fine, but was a bit cold and not salted enough.  All in all, I would return and try something else on the menu.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Wow, I gather no heat equals no flavor on the chicken.  You get this star only because of the greens.  Went on a Friday night.  Got a table and waited ONE hour for our food.  After waiting 45 minutes went to the cashier.   He said food was being prepared , but he asked what our original order was.  Wrote it down.  They totally forgot our order and were scrambling to get it done.  Family that just arrived got their food in less than 15 minutes.  Online and take out orders were flying out the door and being handled.  Maybe offer to comp?   Nope not here.  Here's a hint, next time don't lie.   When the food arrived at our table after an hour of waiting it was super disappointing.  And it would have been disappointing even if we only waited ten minutes like the family at the table next to us did.   Go to Bishops.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"This place is awful. Absolutely awful. I ordered a quesadilla and it came covered in grease. Not one of the people in the process of cooking and delivering the food stopped to look at this disgusting grease covered dish. I'm the whitest white bread person and I could make better Mexican food with my eyes closed. They definitely don't have fresh food, the wait staff doesn't seem to care if they get your order right, the only part about this place that is any good is the mariachi band.   If this place was anything like Carmelita's off 54 and 19, I would be here every week.   Unfortunately, this place along with pretty much every other restaurant in this plaza is just a massive disappointment.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I had drinks at the Bank & Bourbon bar, which is in the Loews hotel lobby a few years ago and we loved the drinks and the bartender was pretty good, so I decided to plan a friend's 40th birthday dinner here since he loves bourbon.   Unfortunately, the service was a little disappointing. It didn't seem like we had a dedicated server, and maybe that's just how this restaurant works, but we didn't have anyone come by at any point in the evening to check in on us. And they forgot my parmesan rosemary fries :( While I didn't see a discount on our check for their mistake, I did notice that they took off 5 coffees from our check... but then again I don't know if they left the coffees off on purpose or they just forgot to include them. And the water refill... I've been trying to stay hydrated all night and unfortunately they didn't do well refilling my water throughout dinner - and yes we all did get cocktails and bourbons with our dinner as well.   On a good note, the food was very good - everyone enjoyed their meals. I might consider the bar again but because of the lackluster service, I'll have to pass on eating here again, regardless of the good food.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
Great food. Waitstaff... mehhh.  I prefer the Bucktown location over Iberville. I am a regular at both locations; the food is delicious. But the Iberville waitstaff could be better. The folks that bring the food from the kitchen are great.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Average Italian food. I've been here twice, both for large dinner parties of at least 15 people. I wouldn't come here for a date with my husband or bring family as there are other Italian restaurants in which the food is superior. However, this place is great if you need to make a reservation for a large group.   It is important to note that you order family style. Everything, from salads to pasta and entrees, are available in small or large. Small feeds two people, large feeds four. My husband and I can usually agree on a dish to share.  Our last visit, we ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni. It was OK. Not really spicy in either of our opinions, and the sauce was sparse. I did not really taste much garlic or crushed red pepper. We also split a caprese salad, which was good, but then again, it's hard to mess that one up!  Service was good for a large group.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I'm afraid my vocabulary isn't expansive enough to properly put down all the accolades my taste buds want to award to Southern.  This place is simply amazing.  The chicken is crunchy, moist, tremendously flavorful.  I've had both the medium and the general tso versions and I definitely preferred the medium. It definitely packs a heat punch but the chicken tastes so good I just ignored the flames inside my mouth and kept going back for more.  The sides also stand up well to the chicken - I've enjoyed the mashed potatoes, chips, mac 'n cheese, and the slaw.  Next time I'll have to remember to try the fried green tomatoes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"The great reviews brought me here. The experience was anything but great.  Order the Hemingway daiquiri, they said. Sure, I love a good daiquiri. But as a bartender I make good daiquiris blindfolded. My home bar has more liquor than some pubs. So when I open my wallet I expect a GREAT daiquiri.   Last night I jaunted up a back stairwell into an intimately cozy tiki lounge with very nice decor and funky background tunes. At the tiny bar, two other customers were trying to decide on a drink. Of the 3 bartenders, two preferred to chit chat rather than even acknowledge my presence.  When one finally handed me a menu, I told her I already knew what I wanted - the legendary Hemingway. As she began mixing I asked, isn't it supposed to be frozen? She replied, no it's made straight up. Puzzled, I asked, so no frozen drinks here? None, she replied.   My bar etiquette allowed her to continue mixing. Plus she was very sweet and well-mannered. Then, she suddenly stopped and said with an excited smile, Oh yes, we USED to serve frozen Hemingways back in 2014. I politely nodded. I figured I'd get a drink that was at least comparable in volume and ALC to a frozen daiquiri, so no biggie.   What I got was roughly 6 ounces of something that cost nearly 10 bucks. The unfamiliar rum brand was included on the receipt, and was about 80% of the total bill. So I asked her what country was it from? She read the bottle label and said, South America. She paused with a bit of a blush, realizing that answer wasn't very specific.   She continued scanning the label until she found Guyana. To which I replied, well that must be some drink for this price. She grudgingly agreed, while also suggesting it might be a bit overpriced. How overpriced I did not realize until I had already left the bar. The drink was more like a very dry martini; the complete opposite of a daiquiri.  I ended up going to the typical frozen daiquiri joint on Canal. You know the kind, severe lighting with oppressively loud hip hop music that you must yell in order to place an order? Yeah, that kind. Yet, the frozen goodness I departed with was exactly what I wanted. It was tasty and packed a wallup.   A real shame though. The tiki lounge bartender was quite adorable if awkward. And I'd pay them another visit (for non daiquiri drinks) as long she's my bartender.   Cheers!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Below mediocre. Lasagna was straight up Stouffers frozen lasagna, all the way down to the processed meat ""bits"". Spaghetti was tolerable, along with the personal pizza. Garlic bread was nice.

The food here is great. We had the New York strip and the cioppino. Both fantastic. The garlic potatoes needed a bit of salt and pepper but was ok. The reason I can't give this place a 5 was because of the cigarette smoke. It was awful! I felt like I was getting lung cancer just being there. If it wasn't Christmas Day and I thought I could find dinner elsewhere we wouldn't have stayed.  Although the food was good I'll never go back.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"A decent first impression, with a little bit of a line but still lots of fun items to buy where you order. Do you have the right amount of time to look at the menu and decide what you want while you are waiting on the long line. We got here around five and the line was still long. Once you get your food, you can play ping pong or darts (very fun). I got the ribs but they were very fatty which is normally good but not this time. However, the pulled pork sandwiches were tasty. I would go back, but I wouldn't get any ribs.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"I don't know how this place gets such high reviews. I think that Ewing is just deprived of decent Indian food. I ordered online and then waited 10 minutes to drive there, took a 10 minute drive from my office, and then waited 20 minutes at the restaurant for shahi paneer. Are you kidding me? I could've cooked shahi paneer in 40 minutes. By that time, I had no lunch break left and I was eating a small container of mediocre food. I'm giving it 2 stars since my food had some decent spiciness but otherwise not worth the excruciating wait.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
