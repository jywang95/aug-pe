This was by far the worst visit... no pretzel dogs were made... the girl at the register seemed to be in a rush to leave! And then I asked for two pretzels in a bag to go and when I get to work they are both burnt!! Gross!!! The slogan says we're so much more than just fresh pretzels! Maybe we should focus on getting a nice soft pretzel like your slogan!,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
The only thing good here are the drinks and the location. They dunk their tacos in a tangy red sauce that does not complement the food at all. There were seven of us that ain't here and not one person enjoyed their meal. Things tasted very bitter and dry.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Ate here Thursday June 12th.  It was roughly 9:00PM, I had crawfish etouffee, my wife had gumbo and shrimp, and my son had shrimp.  The food was ok kind of bland I have had better for less.

"Not bad, just not very good either. Cosi is one of those places I've been to so many times over the years and yet no one experience is significant enough to warrant even much of a review. The food is mediocre (at best sometimes) and the fact that they don't have any table service is both a plus and minus at times. Really, the only reason I bother going here is if I need to meet someone for a quick bite but need it to be more substantial an establishment than the deli for a sub. The salads are wilted and sad most of the time (although huge). The sandwiches are pretty pathetic and waayyyy overpriced for what you get. The only real plus is the squagels (square bagels) but they stop serving those at 11am so I rarely have a chance to get them. Basically, it's a good spot to grab a quick (albeit boring) lunch on Walnut street.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"We've been here at least twice.  The first time was excellent!  However, the second time which was around May/June, a few strange things happened.  First, our food took an exceptionally long time.  Second, someone who we thought to be a substitute chef, came out to apologize for having left an item off of one of the dishes (it wasn't one of ours).  Third, our server took our bill and cash and didn't come back (which would have meant an exorbitant tip).  We had to ask the other server to go find her.  We were one of the last two couples in the restaurant, so it wasn't as though they were really busy.  Very strange.  We just noticed they changed their concept to a more casual café, so we're not sure if we'll return.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Better than usual meal.    Thai curry style mussels - tasty and spicy with cocoanut milk Burger with foie gras - always a winner - consistently good, nice and crispy sweet potato fries Duck breast with sweet potato purée and corn relish - very good - the duck could have been a bit rarer Salmon filet with celery root purée and orzo, fennel, kalamata olive salad special- very yummy.  Perfectly cooked salmon.   Macadamia nut cheesecake - moist and creamy with toasted macadamias and caramel sauce - almost took an extra slice home.  Service. Not as good.   Listened to the male.  Ignored the female.   Guess she( the waitress) didn't know who was calculating the tip tonight.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
"The food is good but the online menu doesn't seem to match the menu in the restaurant. At least for what I tried to order. I ordered online and went to pick it up about 20 or more mins later. When I got there, they hadn't even started cooking my order, so I had to wait, which wasn't a big deal....BUT then things kinda went left. I ordered an entree based on the description on the menu. What I got was totally different. Tried showing them the online menu to let them see that what they gave me doesn't match. But they said I received what I ordered. They did offer to remake it but at that point I didn't have the time, and it almost seemed like what I ordered was not even a menu item. They did refund me. And the food I've eaten from here in the past was good. But  this was a crummy experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I grew up loving Steak 'n Shake. At the time, they were only located off of interstates so it was a treat to get a steakburger, shake, and shoestring french fries. The service was always excellent and the food was fresh. This particular location doesn't embody that legend. The servers are nice but always seem stressed out and short staffed. If they forget a straw, napkin or you need something extra, be prepared to wait a while. The food is mediocre at best and seems haphazardly prepared. The restrooms could use a total remodel. Over all, I think I will satisfy my SnS cravings at a different location....at least until this one gets new management.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"If I could give this place 0 stars I would: they charge my boyfriend a 18% tip for going to eat with his family. The service was horrible. He waited over 8 minutes to get one refill of water. The server never checked in to make sure anything was okay. She was one of the worst servers I've ever had. Pinkish mask on, short with brown hair. I called to speak to the manager & they passed me to the busboy. Not the manager. Beware of this place. They said they charge parties of more than 12 a 18% gratuity. 2 of those ""12"" people didn't eat. You do the math. This place is pathetic with very pathetic people working. Educate your waiters because that rude little girl said 12 or more, oh & your busboy/owner. Lmao. Also try replying to other reviews as well. They would like to hear back from you too, those people were very disappointed with service & food as well. Make that right for them!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"After my first time at Serpico, I left impressed but not wowed by what I ate.  Sure, certain portions of my meal were wonderful but I hadn't experienced the bliss that I was expecting to get when I went into the meal.  This was unfair of me and on a subsequent visit I was thoroughly impressed and have officially become a fan of this place.  What impressed me the most about Serpico was that even though the house was packed, with all seats full, both in chairs and at the counter (where I sat), the kitchen didn't seem to miss a beat.  They just kept on in perfect fashion and food just kept rolling out.  Big props to the staff on that.  The hand torn pasta that we shared was peculiar because on first bite I wasn't expecting the taste of snail.  As I continued eating it though, it grew on me and by the end of the dish, I really enjoyed it.  The pig tail, a special that evening was marvelous.  It was falling of the bone and sitting on a bed of polenta that had hot sauce all over it.  I think the kitchen was having fun and I appreciated eating what they turned out.  The lamb ribs for two also did not disappoint in the least.  It was a hefty portion and the texture on this dash was also fantastic.  The yogurt was an excellent opposite flavor to the spicy vegetables that were also alongside the meat.  The sauce for the ribs themselves tasted very complex and was sweet, salty, a bit sour and just left me puzzled as to how they made it.  It looks like Serpico is here to play and I like it.  I was unsure how they would fit on south street but it seems like people are filling the seats and the kitchen is putting out the good stuff.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I ordered my food here through Yelp/GrubHub. Two hours and ten minutes later, I get a notice that my food was just picked up. I called the restaurant and she said my food had been sitting ready for pick up for over an hour. She said that Yelp and GrubHub always take forever and to order from their website or Uber Eats. I am very disappointed that I not only have waited for over two hours (still haven't gotten it) but am expecting cold food with melted ice in my drink. What a shameful way to run a company literally made to review and rate services. And I paid a $4.50 fee to use the service? Disgusting!

"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in all of New Orleans.  An Asian/Latin/Cajun/Creole fusion spot, in an unassuming part of lower Mid-City.    It's a fairly small restaurant, with some back courtyard seating, a long bar, and a few tables inside.  The grill and line are visible from the bar, which always makes for a show.    Some of my favorite menu items:  Lemongrass chicken tacos (can order just a single, or 2 or 3!)  Tater tots!!!! Hot sausage  Italian beef Dr. Tan burger Chopped salad.... I could go on!   Great spot to grab a beer, watch the game, grab a quick lunch, or a date night dinner.  Mellow atmosphere, and the service is always friendly.

"I often go to pho cali because I don't know other vietnamese restaurants in philly. The spring rolls are pretty good, but the grilled pork egg noodle is just fine. However, the service is poor. I am sure that lots of customers at pho cali always see the unfriendly female owner.   One day, I ordered the grilled pork noodle with soup on side because I normally ordered soup in the bowl. Surprisingly, when the soup was on the side, the noodle tasted better, but the bowl of soup is really small. When my soup almost ran out, I asked more for a bowl of soup.  Then she unfriendly told me that ""next time if you want more soup, just put it in the bowl. This is the way we do""   I was upset. just a bowl of soup... why didn't she just bring it for me right away and charge me for this? She made me feel like it was too much to ask for another bowl of soup.   I was a loyal customer there but I am no longer.   Besides, she never smiled at me once.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

We sat down for 30 min before being served & when the server finally came back up to us she told us to hold on because she was busy no water no menus no nothing ! Not only that the weird ass hosts stood there starring at us the whole time .. (super creepy) I asked the manager to see what was going on & she did super nice & professional & then the server comes back mad & aggressive asking me did I tell the manager she wasn't doing her job & I said yes I did ! That was pure bullshit and she served us cold spinach dip.  Not to mention she walked passed the table 5xs like I was supposed to be scared or something ! I will be reporting this to corporate!

Good bar scene for the neighbourhood goin' on. WINE LIST = fair pricing.  Our group of three enjoyed our choices, which accommodated both gluten free ( Celiac) and dairy free. Flavours tamed down to cater for N. American palates, generous portions of good food. (Indian style, no tandoori oven stuff, it's Americanized okay?)

"I think it's impressive what Vedge is trying to accomplish. It's hard to compete with other restaurants of a similar caliber in the area, especially without meat.  Dishes are creative and flavorful, but it seems like they use certain ingredients in excess to compensate. For example- avocado. Of course avocado is delicious! It would be interesting to see some other ingredients not normally associated with being tasty, turned into something delicious.  The desserts were very unique and delightful! Just the right amount, and not too heavy. They have very creative ice cream flavors.  5 dishes total for two people was a perfect amount of food. Not too full, not hungry afterwards.   Apart from the food, the service felt like we were in an assembly line. The food came out very quickly. We ate all our food, drinks, desserts in less than an hour. It wasn't so much of a dining ""experience"" as it was an attempt to turn over tables quickly.   All in all, it is over priced for vegetarian dishes, but they get some points for creativity. I think it's worth it to check out. Obviously an excellent choice for vegetarians.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Not impressed with their service. Accidents happen and it how you handle them that counts. Making jokes instead of giving an apology does not make the problem go away. The GM needs training on customer service skills or just needs to be demoted to bus boy.   Waitress brings a tray full of water. She appears to be struggling with it. Places one glass then the the next slips from her grasp and falls right on my lap. I am now drenched in ice cold water. She is apologetic and goes to get me 2 napkins to dry off with (ok?) The GM comes over to the table and instead of asking what he can do to help he cracks a joke about how the rain and me being wet! I asked him if he thought this was funny and he left without comment. After that the waitress decided our table wasn't worth her time and there was no attempt to rectify the situation. We paid the bill and verified if he was actually the manager only for his reps one to be ""its only water."" I ended up buying new pants so we could go watch the movie we had planned.

"We went here with our 7 and 9 year old boys (steak fans) 9/13/19.   I had a royal sazarac, followed by a filet and Mac&cheese, boys split a filet and fries, and momma had a sangria followed by a ravioli of lobster and buratta.     For dessert, mom and the youngest split a chocolate cake, and I split a bananas foster with the oldest son.    Our server John was awesome (seriously, someone needs to give him a pat on the back and a raise, he is a first class host!).  We were taken care of in superb fashion, and wanted for nothing.  The food was sublime, and my wife was very happy that ""this sangria is NOT watered down"".     John allowed our boys to ""help"" prepare the bananas foster, which was a huge hit, and really made their day, as well as some of the other patrons who enjoyed the spectacle.

We decided to come and try it out together, the place was a little loud, there were several people that left due to the volume of the music but whatever we stayed. I ordered an old fashion which was good. We ordered the stinky buns, they were good as well, I ordered the duck tacos which were a little on the cheap side with portion servings of the duck, but extremely heavy on the cabbage! Which also made the tortilla moist due to the water cabbage retains. But all of this was ok, until it was time for our bill it took more than 40 min to get our bill, and to get out of there because our waitress was to busy having drinks, and siting with another table, so we had to go to the host stand and ask for our bill, and pay for our bill there.

"We came on a college night, so our IDs were checked at the door. No big deal of course, we're overage. This was the 4th place we went to on our bar hop and got there around 9, and at that time until 11pm, mixed drinks are just 3 bucks. So that's a pretty unbeatable deal. Unless of course it's 2 or 1.   I had a bourbon and ginger and the wife started with a vodka and cranberry. While we were drinking we looked at the menu and ordered an appetizer. We got the cheesesteak egg rolls. These were pretty good served with a mayo and horse radish sauce. It was my first time having horse radish purposely to my knowledge and was happily surprised with the flavor. I'll be looking it up after this review.   As we waited for our appetizer, my wife saw a blue drink across the bar and asked if it was a blue motorcycle, but we were told it was a Great Piece of Ass. A name I know lol! But it was very tasty. Not too sweet and one where the alcohol will sneak up on you later...not a story for Yelp. Lol!   The place wasn't very crowded at all and the environment was cool and laid back. Most folks kind of kept to themselves. There is a nice sized dance floor here though, so the place has the potential to be a nice after hours venue.

"I love outback. I always feel their food is quality and some of the subtle details they add to each menu item just makes me very happy at times. I've transitioned my diet drastically over the past 10 years where now I am a pescatarian. However, I only eat ""certain"" fishes now and no other seafood like shrimp, lobster, etc. overall, my diet is tricky and picky yet and still through the years, outback has remained one of my favs so when my mom offered to take me there last night, I was so excited.   1) We sat at the bar bc we were on a time crunch and it was a little crowded in the lobby area with an estimated 20 min wait. The bar lady took forever and a day ... ok maybe 12 minutes to give us a menu. the lobby was busy but the bar was not btw.  I actually had to ask her for one after the unjustified and extremely noticeable wait.   2) A very rude lady reached over my bread with the sleeve of her coat just missing it to grab a drink menu that was behind the bar counter. I told this witch that I could have easily handed it to her instead of her squeezing and maneuvering so much to reach so far. what is wrong with ppl and keeping comfortable distances ESPECIALLY when one's food is involved? It was so much for her too like she was on her tip toes trying to get to that menu when I'm right there and could easily have gotten it for her. ughhhhh. I was annoyed and she seemed even more bothered that I pointed this out that ummmmm excuse you but I could have handed that to you!!!   3) #2 above is not really outback's fault I guess. the reason she probably felt the need to be so extra and take matters into her own hands was bc of probably a similar experience with my #1 (extra long wait for service). however, #2 is probably why I was feeling a little agitated at this point so now I'm paying attn to everything more than normal which leads me to my final issue. I watched in horror the server bring out 2 plates of food uncovered, without a tray, through a crowd of ppl who were in her path that she had to squeeze through to get by. She was short and had to maneuver her way through the many deaf ears when she said excuse me.  Like I said, she was short so I watched the plates of food in her hands basically inadvertently touch the end tips of a pony tail of some lady whose back was facing her. both completely oblivious to what these poor plates of food to be eaten are going through. I watched in disbelief and shook my head as she walked passed us thanking God she didn't stop at us .... until she turned around and walked back to us happy and bubbly unbeknownst to any of what I just stated, and said ""hehe I gotta learn the bar numbers"" like walking past us was the only mistake she made with our food.  I couldn't even begin to explain this to anyone there like management or whatever so I just nibbled and picked at my food, paid and left. figured for my level of frustration at the time, I could better convey my experience here on Yelp.   lesson of the day: look up a creative recipe and cook a restaurant type of meal @home!!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Food taste and ambiance would rate 5 stars for this restaurant, but the service was extremely dodgy.  Our server spoke so softly that I had a hard time understanding him.  After he took our order and brought our wine, he acted like we were not his table.  Eventually, he brought bread to us on the way to another table, but I ended up refilling our wine the entire evening.  He was in the dining room, in fact, and continually walked by and by and by but would not look at us or acknowledge that we were in the restaurant.  Finally, as we were waiting for our check, we realized what was happening - all of the servers were talking about getting out early and going out or to parties.  Clearly, no one was riding herd on these twenty-something servers.  To top it off, they incorrectly charged my credit card, reversed it, and then ran it again correctly.  However, their merchant service takes up to a week to reverse the incorrect charge - so I'm out $120 for a week!  If the food wasn't so good and the restaurant so romantic, I'm certain we would not give them another chance.  But since it is, we probably will.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The food is bland at most, and the staff just isn't that friendly. I was going to give it at least 2 stars because at least the mini maple butter biscuits are good, but my last visit pushed me over the edge because we entered a half empty restaurant with glasses of ice water already set on every table.

"It could be a freak incident but I have never (and I eat out 5-6 days a week) in all my life had bad Chinese food ........until now!   Nasty food.   Fried rice with freezer burn on the vegetables..... vegetables that looked dirty, after being cooked, mushrooms from a can and rubber shrimp.    To top it off my soup I ordered had a chlorine taste to it.    Either the pot used wasn't rinsed properly or the water used for the broth was tap water that was chlorinated  or something.   I had both people with me try the broth and everyone said it tasted like chlorine. We left politely and took all the food to go and quickly found a trash container to dispose of it.   It was all wrong.  It's hard to eat and before my 7th or 8th bite I didn't feel well.  I stopped and we all decided to quietly leave and take the food so we didn't offend.   I'll never go back.

"I was pretty excited to finally get a Pizza Hut in the Santa Barbara area, but upon my first visit, I was sadly disappointed. I placed an online order, which is pretty difficult to mess up, but they managed to. I didn't go for any of their fancy new additions like the new crusts, sauces, drizzles, etc. but given this experience, I'm not confident they could even handle any of those. I simply ordered a meat lovers pizza with extra sauce, and the amount of sauce on my pizza was pathetic. It seemed like even less sauce than normal. Not only that, but the pizza just wasn't good. After a couple bites, I decided to forego eating the pizza altogether, and found a homeless man to give it to. Meanwhile, I was starving but went to Woodstocks and waited for a pizza actually worthwhile.   In addition to the poor quality, the service also wasn't great. The pizza was nearly cold and the girl working there was kind of rude and basically suggested leaving a tip...for a take out order. When I got back into my car, I saw her ranting to her co-workers about something in rather animated fashion. I'm not conceited enough to think it had anything to do with me, especially since I was friendly and raised no issues, despite lacking customer service. However, it just didn't seem professional to me. Granted, how professional could one expect someone who works at Pizza Hut to be, but still.   If this is how this location operates when it just opened, I can just imagine how the quality and service will decline over time. Hopefully, for their sake, it improves, but I'm not sure if I'll be going back there.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"My husband and I are definitely a fan of Parc. We ate here tonight, with a reservation, and were seated immediately.   We received water, and the bread basket soon after being seated (which was delicious). We ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer, which was amazing. The shrimp were big, and very fresh. The cocktail sauce had just the right amount of horseradish in it. As for our entrée, I ordered the 1/2 roasted chicken, and my husband ordered the veal. Okay, so, my roasted chicken was awful. I'm sorry, Parc, maybe it was just an off night? The chicken tasted like a rotisserie chicken from the market that was cut in half and thrown on my plate. It just wasn't good. The mashed potatoes, however, were very creamy and the best I've had. My husband's veal was tender, and the mushrooms were an excellent pairing to the veal. I really enjoyed his dish; I would definitely order it for myself next time.  We're definitely coming back this weekend to try their brunch. Great atmosphere, and our server was very nice.

I ordered the crab cakes. They were fishy. I've had fresher tasting crab cakes at home in Central Illinois. My husband got the jambalaya pasta. It was SWIMMING in grease. Two of my daughters got chicken Alfredo to split. It was also extremely greasy and a very small portion. The packaging was terrible. Flimsy styrofoam containers for a pricy meal is too bad. The containers were all crushed when we got them. The grease from the pasta dishes was EVERYWHERE. The girl that took my order on the phone was rude. They only take exact change cash as payment. I was told 45 minutes for delivery. It was an hour and fifteen minutes before it arrived. The delivery driver was super sweet.

And if you're not cool with whatever type of crowd is in there, just go sit outside at one of their tables.

Sorry to say, but I have had street tacos that were much tastier.  I forgot to mention, I was charged $5 for chips and salsa which is fine, but if you are going to charge, make sure the chips are fresh which these were clearly not.

"Christmas Eve dinner with my parents started out good. The Salmon pate amuse and Prince Edward mussels were delicious and reminded us of our time living in the Pacific Northwest. My house salad was good. The dressing light with a hint of citrus. The Pork Belly Salad Mom and Dad had were ok but the creole mustard dressing was heavy and over done. It needed to be lightened or thinned or served on the side. The disappointing parts were all in the main course. Filet tournedos ordered med rare were medium. Scallops served with them were overcooked and rubbery, the green beans were over cooked, wrinkly and soft with no crisp or toothsomeness, and clearly it had waited for service because the arugula on the plate was shriveled. Dad's Halibut was overcooked and dry, the root vegetables were actually delicious, but what was thought to be sauteed mushrooms and onions was actually brussel sprouts so over cooked to lacking in color and tasting like smothered cabbage which doesn't really go with Halibut in my mind the way properly cooked green brussel sprouts would have. We actually thought they subbed out the sprouts for mushrooms. Mom's red snapper was also over cooked and dry with the second root vegetables as Dad's but she also was unfortunate to have a similar batch of green beans as I had: wrinkly and soft and mushy in your mouth. We reviewed the dessert menu but it was mainly one note of chocolate and/or caramel with only an option of pavlova or creme brulee if you were looking to finalize your meal.

"I am a huge fan of this place because of the food, service, and variety. I continue to frequent here and it's my top casual steakhouse choice.   First of all, service: one of the waiters, Davide, was EXCELLENT. We ate at Outback over a month ago and I still remember his name! He knew the menu like the back of his hand, including the names of items that they don't longer serve. And when we asked for Sydney's Sinful Sundae, he told us it wasn't a problem for them to make. But he wasn't the only example--the waiters/waitresses here are overall awesome and try to make your experience as pleasant as possible. I asked one waitress for a warm alcoholic drink one night and she was really quick to think--amaretto and hot chocolate is now my favorite winter beverage!   Next is the food and variety. I love the surf and turf options that they have, first off. Every time I order the prime rib and lobster, it's made to perfection. Also, the steaks--I don't like my steaks (really, food in general) seasoned a lot but my boyfriend does, so for us having the choice makes us both want to come here. I also love their soups and sides. The one side I wish they have is corn, but hey, no one is perfect. AND THEY NEED TO BRING BACK SYDNEY'S SINFUL SUNDAE!!!!!

This place honestly would of gotten a zero if it weren't for the floor manager. I walk in and no one says hi or nothing. Takes me forever to get a drink, while the waitress constantly ignore me and my parents.  It was my birthday so I order the most expensive thing, the seafood tower, which was pathetic like the service I was received. I seriously had better service in Chinatown. That is one hell of a statement,it was not expensive so it makes it someone tolerable.   Avoid this place, until they clean up their act.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Worst experience ever!    Pretty sure it wasn't completely our servers fault, so I'll start with that.  We sat outside, waited 15 minutes to finally ask for a server.  After waiting nearly an hour for food, we finally got 2 of 3 of our meals.   One meal was cold.  After 10 mins of waiting for that third meal, we asked for the manager.  This ""general manager"" dropped the meal - the MOST condescending and rude manager.  Actually rolled her eyes at us a few times.    One positive - and wish we would have got her name, but a neighboring server dropped out to-go food and apologized for the service.   Kudos to you, thank you for going the extra mile.   Will never go back here again.  Horrible service.  Rude manager.  Not worth it!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I have been impressed with Baja on each of my two visits thus far. If you are planning to go, just be prepared to wait in line. The portions are huge and the ingredients all marry well together. They add a Tex-Mex flavor to breakfast with their ingredients. The menu is extensive, offering many combinations of breakfast (and anytime) selections. The bloody mary was surprisingly amazing (note I am very picky about my bloodies and this was soo good, just the right thickness/consistency).

There was only one hibachi table with people sitting at it and they were just starting to cook.

"I want to give this place a higher rating but in some ways this place is a 1 or 2 star because sadly, as other reviews have stated, this place still allows smoking and it stinks inside...sigh, hopefully someday this will change but until then, I don't see myself going here very often.   On to the good things about Sidelines...lots of seating, drink specials, decent food for cheap prices. There is also a dance floor that I believe brings out a crowd on Saturday nights? Never been to that.  My sister, our men and I recently wanted some beer on a Sunday and decided to head over there. It appeared that the bartender was the only person serving in the whole restaurant but she did a really good job despite having a lot of tables/people at her bar. I would have expected service to be slower than it was but it was a fine pace for a lazy Sunday lunch. She earns 5 stars! We got lots of beer and some loaded fries to start and those were pretty good, good size to split 4 ways. I ordered the club sandwich and it was fine, I took out the third piece of middle bread because I don't think it adds anything to club sandwiches! It was not bad for the price and I got waffle fries with them and those were actually really good!   I really wouldn't mind coming here more regularly, they have 32 oz Summer Shandy on special right now!! But I got a headache from the smell and I just don't like being around it, however, I think they probably have a lot of regulars who smoke so I don't know if we'll see a change unless they are forced to do so.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"First all the staff were warm and inviting, knew their stuff and were very helpful. I had the chefs plate, and the pork rillette, amazing! All the meat was cooked perfectly, nice char on the outside, sweet and fall off the bone tender in the inside. Pork rillette was set up with various pickled vegetables, beats and cauliflower, and what I am assuming is a pickled onion confit, or onion jam. Amazing can not state that enough. Baked beans had an harissa flavor profile that I never would of thought of coming together, and were the best I ever had. On that note the potatoes chips that came with the rillette were the best I ever had, fresh or store bought and need to be mass produced like yesterday.

"Wow!  Our experience here was amazing.  We made reservations about three months in advance for our office holiday party, and it was our best dinner yet.  First, our table was excellent - right next to the large kitchen windows where we could watch the chefs preparing everything.  Secondly, our server Mark was phenomenal. He handled all of our whims and requests without blinking an eye, joking and laughing with us, staying on top of food and cocktails the entire night, and generally being perfect.  Finally the food.  So delicious! We started with their version of seafood tower with lobster claws, oysters, crab and shrimp.  Everything was cooked perfectly, with the highlight, to me, being the crab.  My entree of surf and turf, with not one but TWO lobster tails, and filet was perfection. I loved all the family-style side dishes we shared, but my surprising favorite was the creamed spinach.  Asparagus, brussels sprouts, and loaded mashed potatoes were also excellent.  My dessert of carrot cake was okay - I loved that our server actually heated it slightly with a butane torch. My favorite dessert however was the butter cake.  Yum!  Fabulous experience from start to finish, and I loved every minute of it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"I don't know where to start between the bad service and the bad bread. Basically it's all bad. The only reason I give it 2 stars is for their price deals. $2 for a sub is not bad, but honestly I wouldn't even pay that. First time I had a sub it was ok. Bread was pretty weak, tasted bland and was definitely old. Second time I ordered one for delivery during one of their $2 deals. I waited 45 min. and couldn't wait any longer because I had to go to class so I called them to cancel the order and they were very unaccommodating. They said the sandwich was about to be sent out.

"The first time I had Hodak's fried chicken, I had the small chicken wings. They were juicy and delicious. I was in love.   I went back today for lunch. I had the Chicken drumstick platter. It came with 4 fried chicken drumsticks, cole slaw, and french fries. It was definitely a good deal for $6.30 -- it came with a TON of food, and I could barely eat it all.   But something was missing, chicken-wise. It wasn't as good as the first time. The batter was off or something; it started tasting like cornmeal after a while. By the time I got to my 4th drumstick, I couldn't take it anymore.   I'm not going to give up, though; they have a very expansive menu, and really good prices. But I was disappointed this time.   On the plus side: Their fries were GOOD. And they give you a lot. Yay! I wasn't crazy about the cole slaw, though; it was too vinegary for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Unfortunately, our family had a negative lunch experience today at Sake and as a result, we won't be returning in the future.   We arrived at 12:20, but luckily there wasn't a long wait and we were quickly seated. We ordered our meal, along with a bottle beer and Sake while waiting for our order to come out. We waited.. and waited.. and waited. People came in after us, were seated and we watched table after table receive their food before us. After a 30 minute wait, we decided to leave without eating and ended up going to another restaurant.

"I have written, re-written and then rewrote this review several times - trying not to sound like a bitter person that is hard to please.    If you are reading this - maybe I was happy enough with this review to finally publish it.    So - here was my problem : It was my birthday dinner and I chose Rock Bottom because I thought it'd be  nice to dine outside on the upstairs patio.  Little did I know that they have two menus.  One upstairs, one downstairs.  Totally different kitchens.  So, if I wanted the 'good food' - we'd have to eat downstairs.  Bummer.  So, we put our name in at the downstairs restaurant.  30 Minutes pass and we are finally ready to be seated.  Once seated - our server takes our drink orders and delivers them quickly.  Then time for our food orders.  Those who ordered salads and soup - they are delivered quickly.  So far, so good.  Then the wheels fall off.  Nearly an hour passes before our entrees are delivered.  I ordered the Sirloin Steak with Jalapeno Butter.  The steak had exactly zero flavor and zero heat.  And, not to mention - it was cold along with the onion rings and white cheddar mashed potatoes.  How could it be, I thought?  They brought it out on a cast iron skillet before plating it.  The presentation looked nice - but really?  How is this already cold?  I asked a friend who got the Mac and Cheese (and loved, by the way) was I crazy?  I had him try the steak because, to me, the texture was odd and the flavor was non-existent.  He tried too and was as confused as I was.  He agreed the texture was strange and the flavor wasn't there.  He mentioned that it might have been frozen steak.  The only time he had ever experienced that type of texture and complete lack of basic beef flavor was when he had frozen some steaks and tried to thaw and cook them later.  This was similar.  I agreed once I thought about it.  Now, whether or not this is an accurate reflection on what actually happened to my steak - I will never know.  But I will tell you it wasn't good.  If it was fresh - I have no idea what they did to make it so flavorless and bland and...odd textured.    So, I will say that the server and the manager tried to do right by me by offering me something else to eat.  But, at this point - after having waited for what, at this point, was closing in on the two hour mark - I just wanted to go.  And most of my friends were already done or close to being done - so, making them wait while a new entree is cooked and then waiting for me to eat it didn't seem like a nice thing to do.  So, I declined.    At the end of the night - the manager picked up the tab for the table, minus our drinks. That was nice, I guess.  They all seemed happy because they enjoyed their meals and didn't complain.  But, I did complain and still hadn't had anything to eat. So yes - I had no food, spent two hour there - and still had to pay for my diet coke.  I did leave a tip based upon the food I would have ordered because it wasn't the servers fault and he did try to make me happy.    If you wanted to make me happy - you could have done a couple things:  1)  Not charge me for my diet coke because, after 2 hours in your restaurant - that was all I had minus a bite of cold, flavorless and oddly textured steak.    2)  Offer to have me come back on your dime.  Offering me a quesadilla to go because it is 'fast' doesn't really solve my desire to have a nice meal on my birthday with my friends.  I ordered a steak and offering me a quesadilla to go isn't even in the same ballpark.  To me, that is like renting a luxury car and getting to the rental place and all they have is economy cars.  I realize I'm still getting a car - but it wasn't what I ordered, it wasn't how I wanted to it and doesn't come close to meeting my expectations.  So yes, rather than take something I didn't want - I left without nothing - except I was down $30 for a diet coke and a tip to the server ($10 bucks) and parking (20 bucks) because, apparently, Tom Petty was in town at Bridgestone Arena.    Will I be back?  Unlikely.  A diet coke doesn't cost me $30 at home.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Never had an issue with the food here but I am sorry to say that I stopped coming when they moved away from all-you-care-to-eat style.  It was nice as they would charge you one price for several food options.  The owner has always been nice and we enjoyed our interactions with him.  We returned several months ago and they had opted for a individually priced menu and eliminated the additional portions.  Unfortunately the prices stayed the same.  I ordered Chicken Tiki Masala and it was @$17.  The dish was small, did not include Naan, and only came with a small portion of rice.  Add Naan and tip (I drank water) and you're looking at $25 for lunch.  That's steep.  While I have no problems otherwise, I can't in good conscious pay that much when there are cheaper options out there.   We now go to another establishment in Harleysville for a $12 Indian lunch buffet.  Food is comparable and it's 1/2 the price.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"The Oceanaire Seafood Room means to be Philadelphia's swanky new seafood restaurant with a dramatic dining experience reminiscent of a grand old 1930's ocean liner.  I'd have to say they pulled it all off quite nicely.  When you walk into the Oceanaire you find yourself greeted by a huge space with very high ceilings, beautiful art deco theme, a grand staircase and of course some of that 1930's big band music.  The bars (alcohol and oyster) are also near the entrance, opulent and beautifully lit, this place definitely gets an A+ for its execution of ambiance and interior design. Now if only the food was as interesting as the venue itself.    Oceanaire's menu is pretty large, although by far not the largest I've seen for a fresh seafood restaurant.  They have a decent selection of fish flown in that morning and a smaller selection of ""specialties"" which may also vary from day to day.  Most of the sides and appetizer dished are ""family"" sized portions, although between myself and the two other people I dined with I felt that the dishes were stretched kinf of thin, especially the salad which I really think I could have finished by myself. Unfortunately, while the fish was admittedly very fresh and tasty, the various dishes along with their presentation were a little on the bland side.  All of the food was certainly passable, definitely good, but nothing really piqued my interest as exceptional.  The Boston salad was good, with grapes, sherry vinaigrette and a hint of anise --- thankfully just a hint, as I feel that any more anise would have made for a rather unpleasant salad.  The appetizer of lump crab cake was quite delicious --- probably my favorite item of the evening.  The server claimed that their crab cakes are made of about 95% crab and I'd say that that sounded about right!  The crab was sweet, succulent, fresh and when paired with the mustard mayonnaise sauce which they sided with the cakes the flavors were really top notch. I ordered an entre of ""Black & Bleu"" Mako Shark with sweet onion confit and bleu cheese.  Sadly this dish was so boring I really couldn't eat it.  The onion confit was just not that great and had a weird kind of tangy bite to it that just wasn't pleasant to me, the blue cheese tasted rather weak and the mako itself was simply very plain.  I wish I would have ordered the flounder stuffed with crab, shrimp & brie.  I also tried their mahi-mahi which was cooked with a chili sauce which was pretty tasty, better than my mako, in any case.   The side of potatoes gratin were good as long as you ate them as soon as possible after being set on your table. Once the dish began to cool, it became much less appetizing and turned into a tough and chewy mass of cubed potatoes.  The dessert selection was fairly wide, but I went with the crme brulee.  I know, so unexciting but I just love the stuff so much I can never turn it down.  Our portion of brulee was very large --- two brulee fanatics were unable to finish it --- topped with a small amount of fresh berries.  As far as crme brulee goes, I would say Oceanaire's was somewhat better than average. Service at Oceanaire is very pleasant and knowledgeable, the waiters weren't always hanging over the table, but they weren't M.I.A. either.  Its not that I won't ever return to The Oceanaire, but I don't see myself making much effort to come back any time soon either.  I say try it out and form your own opinion as the place really fell in a grey area for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"When Rosalita's Cantina opened in Des Peres it was on my list but then I started reading the horror story reviews and never made it there. On Wednesday I ended up meeting a friend there for an early dinner. I grew up in this area and used to eat at the Casa Gallardo in this building pretty frequently. They did a breathtaking job remodeling the space. It was fresh and modern but still felt very familiar. We started munching on the chips & salsa and looking over the menu. I really liked the thin chips others are complaining about. I thought the consistency of the salsa was just too thin but that it had a decent flavor otherwise. My dinner date chose one of the enchilada plates and a margarita. I ordered the Wednesday night special which is Bacon Wrapped Crab Cake Stuffed Shrimp (Served with bourbon creamed corn, tamale fritters, sautéed spinach and roasted garlic butter sauce.) I was pleasantly surprised when the dish was set down in front of me. I loved every single component of this dish. Great textures and flavors. The bacon was crispy and smoky, the shrimp was huge and perfectly cooked. The corn was creamy and sweet and delicious. I would eat this again and again. I'm going to have to remember that they only have this on Wednesday nights. It wasn't a particularly Mexican dish but it was a great dish with some Mexican sabor.

"I will say that the pizza is good for Florida but, the help...  I have been there several times and found the blonde waitress is challenging at best.  She isn't about service or friendliness, just obtuse. They brag aboutbeing from New York and they have the attitude to prove it. If you like New York attitude it will be a good fit, I don't!  Recently I stopped in and ordered a slice of pizza and an Italian sub.  I watched in awe as this blonde waitress put on rubber disposable gloves that had obviously been used. She then wandered around the area, opening refrigerator doors, taking things out, unwrapping meats and containers, back to the kitchen to a slicer and into the walk in and back to grab a roll to make my sub.  In the interim I had finished my pizza slice and was still waiting for my drink. I was choking for the lack of a drink so, I got up walked over and interrupted two other employees who were talking to each other and asked for my drink to as I was choking. The waitress yelled she's got it and to sit down. I said no, I need it now.  After watching her all over the place I got disgusted at the idea that my food was being prepared by a less than sanitary enviroment and it seemed that the waitresst wore gloves to protect her hands and not for the ability to keep a clean work enviroment while preparing food.   I cancelled my sandwich. She was upset.  As I paid I asked another wait person if everything was ok as this waitress always seemed angry with an obvious attitude, he said yes. I then asked the kitchen manager if everything was ok as the service was worse than usual and the waitress doesn't understand the reason for gloves. He said she had to get things to make the sandwich, I suggested she get them before putting on the gloves or to change the gloves.   This was to no avail.  It seemed everyone was angry in this pizzeria today, thats not a customers problem.  I called the other location hoping to get an owner or manager, again to my dismay none were working. They asked if they could help and I shared my interaction with the ""blonde"" waitress and that this wasn't the first time, she was dirty, rude, gave poor service and had a bad attitude.   The response knocked me over, this 30-40 something woman is the daughter of the owner. T  That explains why she is working there!  The pizza is good but, the food is not prepared in a clean environment and this waitress is from hell with a bad attitude. The rest of the staff emulates her.  I won't dine with them again, not with the sanitation and attitude issues.  Try Queens Pizza, Umbertos or The Red Plum.

When I went to dinner on a weekend night I was told they were out of gluten free pasta. After explaining to my server that I am gluten free I  was offered a salad option. I  was shown a second item and was told the risotto (which is gluten free) can have a pasta substitute after we established that they did not have gluten free pasta.

We ordered the spring roll sampler, seafood mac and wings. The spring rolls were average at best. The seafood mac was a nice serving size, it didn't have crab as they were out of crab at the time.

"Had lunch here today with some of my coworkers, at their suggestion.    Menu consists of extensive breakfast offerings, burgers, sandwiches and salads.  I had a fried cod sandwich with fries as my side.  The fish was an actual filet (not square) and came on a grilled sub bun with lettuce,tomatoes, and pickles.  The fish tasted crispy and fresh and the toppings were generous. I like tomatoes and they actually put what I would consider enough tomato on my sandwich.  The fries were crinkle cut and could have used some salt but I took care of that at the table.  They don't have Heinz catsup; I didn't catch what brand it was but I know that's important to some so thought it was worth mentioning.  The best thing about this place was the fact that I may have been their youngest customer.  Yay me!  Also, the service was good.

"Food: Ordered the bibimbap in a clay part for dinner. Served approx. 5 of the appetizers while waiting for my main course: kim chi, dried fish, fish cake, sprouts, and... #5. The service was ""a tad"" slower than I probably would've liked. Both the appetizers and my bibimbap were... satisfactory; they were what I expected. I was neither disappointed or ""wowed"", which quite frankly is fine with me.  Everything else: If I was in a hurry to do anything else besides dinner, I probably would've been a slight be irked. The servers were quite friendly, just a bit ""relaxed"". They offer both ""prepared"" and DIY Korean bbq - grilling the meat yourself at the table. Prices were a tad high, for my ""California Korean Restaurant"" standards. Bibimbap (clay pot) was $12-13. Bulgogi was either $18 (prepared) or ~$40 (DIY) - can't tell you about portions of the bbq as I (nor anybody else around me) ordered it.

Not a huge selection of taps, I could not 14 so not really a tap room but a diverse selection. I was able to find a stout and a sour for my wife. The sour was local, the stout was a small but not local brewery.  We ordered the loaded cheese fries. The cheese sauce and fries were great... could have used some more meet on it. We also got the jalapeño torpedo... these were worth the trip. An order of corn bread to wrap everything up.

"My husband and I recently moved down the street from Eastland. We have been trying to frequent as many of the Eastland businesses as possible and have been pretty pleased with Eastland Cafe.   Their happy hour is probably the best part. They have drink AND food specials daily. You can put together a nice meal from their food offerings! As far as the drinks go, I prefer to opt for the glasses of wine/beer. I find their cocktails to be a little watered down. Service at the bar is prompt and pretty friendly.   I went for a full meal the other day and really enjoyed the Wedge Salad, Shrimp and Grits, and the Chicken Wings (surprisingly amazing!).

"We were visiting Boise and really wanted a great steak. After reading reviews on multiple restaurants, we decided on Stagecoach. They were super busy for a Monday night, but they got our party of two in quickly. We took that as a great sign! I ordered a pineapple press cocktail and all I could taste was lemon. I only drank half so I was a bit disappointed since it was a $10 cocktail. I was also really looking forward to an appetizer before dinner, I love a good app! But sadly, they had NOT one appetizer that didn't contain fish, I can't eat fish :(.  Anyway, the salad and bread before dinner was delicious! We each ordered the bacon wrapped filet, medium. I could tell before I even cut my steak that it was very much a medium rare, border-lining on rare. They threw it back on the grill, but had they been better trained, they wouldn't have had to. The steak was also very bland and not seasoned at all. Will a good amount of salt added, it was ok. It definitely wasn't the super delicious steak I was hoping for and my baked potato was super dry, even after drowning it in butter. So half the meal was amazing, and half was meh. The one thing I would go back for?? The turtle cheese cake. It was the most delicious turtle cheesecake I've ever eaten, and I'm not a skinny girl!! LOL. The service was also amazing, the staff get an A+, the food a C at best. All in all it wasn't horrible but definitely was not a $100 meal.

This may be a southern culture thing, but all the other restaurants we frequented were adequately paced.  The backup may have been happening in the kitchen or with our waiter, but entree orders were put in at 805p.  Food received at 855p.  50 minute wait for food?!  No explanation or apology was given.  At the conclusion of the meal it took about a half hour to get checks (although there were 6 separate checks, so I wasn't too perturbed by this).

"I've only been here once but really enjoyed the sandwich that I ordered.  I had the Rubicon Special which had gouda, turkey, a diced tomato spread, lettuce, and probably a couple other veggies that I forgot about.  I went there right before closing so the only bread they had available was white and pesto, and the pesto bread was excellent.  Definitely some of the better local deli bread that I've had.  The inside of the deli is fairly small but the outside seats plenty of people.  The sandwich was prepared fairly quickly although I was the only person in the place (ten minutes before closing) and I can picture a fifteen or twenty minute wait around a busy lunch hour.  The sandwiches are a bit pricey at $8 for a whole, but you really need to take into account the great tasting bread, fresh quality ingredients, and the size of the sandwich.  Definitely one of the larger sandwiches that the local Reno delis serve up.  I'll definitely be going back here often, although I think Newman's is still my favorite Reno deli because of the selection and prices alone.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Giving it 2 stars since the owner redeemed himself at the end, otherwise it would be 1 or 0. Our Thanksgiving experience was so bad that our entire meal, including alcohol, was complimentary.  The host lady is absolute horrible. Rude and pretentious.  My husband and I went for a Thanksgiving dinner, priced at at $70 per person for a 3 course meal (several appetizers, entree and dessert). Reservation at 5:15 pm, got there 5 minutes earlier, place was pretty much empty (about 4 tables full in the back), meaning the entire main floor was EMPTY. After waiting almost 5 minutes for the host to get off the phone, she looked at us and with the rudest attitude ever, asked us: How can I help you? Humm, let me think... I want to buy baseball tickets..... She had the nerve to tell us, before even being seated, that we had to leave by 7:25. Well lady, if I am going to be spending at least $300 in my Thanksgiving meal, you don't tell me what time I have to leave. Right after that, with the whole restaurant being empty, she took us outside to the balcony, in a very cold night, to be seated in the dark and with no other patrons around. I refused and asked to be seated inside. We sat for 10 minutes and she placed another couple right next to us, with the whole place been EMPTY at 5:30 pm.  The menu stated that for $ 70 you get ""appetizers for the table"", one choice of entree and a dessert. Reality: one appetizer, one entree and no dessert. Waiter told us to ignore the menu. IGNORE IT? Not to have our Thanksgiving ruined, we just ordered one appetizer each, and our main entrees. We were still eating our appetizers and got our main course. At that point my husband, the calmest man on Earth, complained it and send it back. After that it took 45 minutes to get our entree. They realized and gave us a little complementary cognac. Food came and it was just ok. I have been a loyal patron at Little Door and Little Next Door for years in LA and the food is absolute superior than the Santa Barbara one. Once again, the waiter came and said that he didn't know why the menu mentioned dessert since it wasn't included.  At that point we just asked for the bill. I went ahead and asked to speak with the owner, just to tell him that his menu was completely misleading, when, to my surprise, he blamed on his printer in LA that printed the wrong version of the menu. ARE YOU SERIOUS? Then for the lack of service and tardiness, HE BLAMED ON HIS MEXICAN CREW THAT DIDN'T SHOW UP to work. Are you serious again? I don't need to know your employees nationality as if that you made it ok for my bad service. The lady on my right also complained to the waiter about the misleading menu, and as he looked at me, he said to her, oh just ignore it. WTF? Is not the money but the principal. Again, I am giving it 2 stars because the owner tried to make a better experience for us and didn't charge us at all. We left a $40 tip to a less than capable waiter (I won't ever bother to describe our interaction with him). After all that, 2 hours later, I was throwing up my steak, something was really bad with that food.

I think i would probably give this place 3 stars if the same food came out, except hot.  I get the sense that they mass produce their food early and then let it sit there on the kitchen and get cold.  cold egg tarts and lukewarm dumplings?  No thanks.   But even if the food was piping hot, i still wouldn't be a fan.   Aside from the food, i think the service is just fine.  Anyway, even though i just said this place isn't that great, i will come here if I'm really craving dim sum.  It's probably the second best option in terms of food, ocean harbor being number one in Chinatown.

"I know this is a pizza place and I ordered a tuna club which comes with pickles, coleslaw and a side.  I got french fries.  Perhaps they have amazing pizza.  I don't know and maybe one day I will find out, but not any time soon.    Before I really begin, a word about their delivery.  It was an EXCELLENT experience.  It is cheap and quick  and FRIENDLY, which is helpful and rare.  So kudos on the delivery guy.  Maybe I am wrong in this, but I thought a club was cut into neat little triangles and that a tuna club was served with sliced egg.  Not here, evidently.  This was just a sandwich with a piece of bread in the middle.  Tuna, lettuce and tomato.  That was the first disappointment.    The tuna itself is awful.  It looked like it might be good because ti had celery in it but not, it was just awful.  I ate only half of the sandwich because I was super hungry (this is what happens when you eat lunch at 3) but it is not anything I would want to try again.  The lettuce and tomato were good, though.  The fries were blander than bland and over cooked so not even ketchup helped.  Perhaps I could have added salt but didn't think of it until now because I was too busy being upset.

We asked to sit upstairs and were told no right off the bat, not a great start but ok. When we ordered our drinks we notified our waitress that we would be on separate tabs, she didn't like that.

After going to her register and putting in the order, we watched her go to the kitchen and tell the chef that she needed a rib eye cooked medium (exactly what he ordered). The steak came out as we finished our meal, after we said to cancel the order. Kathy told us that we needed to pay for the steak and the mandatory 18% gratuity. We went back and forth for a while, she raised her voice at us and we left. We paid our bill because we're good people and we paid our 18% gratuity because ""it's the law"".

Entree was the redfish oceana - cooked perfectly and topped with a cream sauce w/crawfish tails.  What a great pairing.  The only downside was that I was not that fond of the vegetable side dish.

We stopped to look at their menu and they practically grabbed us in off the street in a really funny and chaming way.  These ladies are clearly very appreciate of your business - which I always appreciate.  The food was huge portions, and my husband loved his fried fish.  The taste was not overly burnt-cooked, as a lot of Chinese tastes to me.  The ladies were really fun and chatty but not in a too-aggressive way - they kind of popped in and out with great service.

"My local watering hole. I come here so often. The food is so fresh and delicious and creative too! Chef does a great job with this location.   Came for dinner with a friend and we both got some chai lattes because it's so cold outside. They were warm and tasty, exactly what we needed. Then we ordered the arancini to start which is always a good idea because they always change the stuffing. I've never had the same arancini twice and every time they are delicious! You can also order an extra ball if you want to share but we just stuck with the 3 that come in the order.   Then we had the steak special for our dinner and we shared. It was cooked to perfection! Absolutely delicious, well seasoned and warm.   Will certainly be back!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Wu's Bistro is located in an older out-dated strip mall and from the interior of the restaurant, which is also outdated, Wu's has probably been around for a long time.  The restaurant offers a solid and very inexpensive lunch option, with our entrees priced just south of $6 bucks! The lunch specials came with choice of soup and rice.  The meal was preceded with some complimentary hot Chinese tea and wontons. Not bad for that price point.  And, the food wasn't bad.  We ordered the Chicken with Broccoli and the Chicken in Garlic Sauce.  I liked the fact that both entrees came with lots of vegetables!  It served the need of a quick and inexpensive Chinese lunch.

"Super excited for the new location, especially that pickup is now available! Really confident for those not in the area or who might not be able to afford delivery fees.  We got our meal last night using UberEats. The price is average, but with an app deal it came out to only $6 (a steal!)  My only disappointments came with the burgers themselves. The taste was great in the patty - really flavorful and filling. However, I paid extra for ketchup and lettuce on the Chris Style and barely got any (see photos). It was also suppose to have fries on top if you check the menu on the website. I think my actual burger had two.   Nonetheless, it was still a good burger, even without receiving my desired add-ons. The Beast Style fries were a mess and okay at best compared to other places. A mixture of mayo, cheese, some spice, pickles, and an array of other ingredients. We added bacon but the recipe is more for a stomach ache then a delicious treat.  Overall not bad, considering it comes from a ghost kitchen. I do recommend the burgers, but if you go in person make sure you get what you paid for.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"My go-to thai place in the Riverview area! I usually get the pad thai, pad kee mao, and panang curry. Those dishes are consistently good. I always like to try pad thai at Thai restaurants and their pad thai delivers with just the perfect amount of tang and sweetness. My protein of choice is usually shrimp or tofu. I wished they had a steamed tofu option since the fried ones can sometimes get a bit chewy. Veggies that come in these dishes are fresh! The rice noodles in the pad kee mao aren't longer noodles like I'm used to, but still tasty! The staff is fast and friendly when I go pick up my orders, but I haven't dined in yet.

"I am a repeat customer, and I ordered my sandwich to be delivered like usual to my work. Got here fine, but the sandwich tasted terrible, one of the ingredients definitely went bad. i threw the sandwich away, and tried to call to tell them about it and ask for a replacement, but they were closed. I called back the next day, and the manager happened to answer the phone. As I explained the situation, she expressed blatant disinterest in the problem, I could even hear her laughing in the background. After a lot of ""uh's,"" ""um's,"" and muffled laughter, she told me there was nothing she could do since I threw the bad sandwich away. She did nothing to help, I did not feel valued at all as a loyal JJ customer, and she was incredibly rude. The conversation ended with me asking ""so there's seriously nothing you can do? You can't give me a replacement sandwich or a gift card or anything?"" To which she simply replied ""Nope,"" then hung up the phone on me.

"Pancake Pantry is known for serving up ""Nashville's Best Pancakes"" and is indeed a place that tourists come to indulge in some short stacks. Located in Hillsboro Village, it is convenient if you plan to do a bit of shopping in the area before heading on to the next activity.   When we came here on a Sunday mid-morning,  the line was out the door as expected. However, it was just about a 15 minute wait to get a table which really wasn't bad at all.  Server was very nice and other staff come around to refill your water glasses and take away any empty plates. Ambiance is just okay, it is like any other diner-type setting. When you get ready to leave you can pay at the register at the front.   If you're going to come here you have to get the pancakes. Any other decision would just be ludicrous as it is part of the name of the place after all! With a large array of different pancakes on the menu I wasn't sure whether to make an out-of-the-box selection like the sweet potato pancakes or to go the more traditional route to play it safe. I ended up going to traditional route with the blueberry pancakes...because I knew this was something that couldn't possibly go wrong. The pancakes were fluffy and the compote was not overly sweet which I like. Got a side of the bacon as well which is always a good decision.   I thought that this place is pretty good, but nothing about it made me excited and feel like I have to come back here. Classic, sure but maybe just not interesting enough for me. If I'm coming to pay $8+ for a plate of pancakes I want a side of something else and more for my money as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"I saw this place on the Diners, Drive-in's and Dives page of the FN website and wanted to see for myself.  I have to say, I was dissapointed.  The rolls brought to the table before the meal were cold and seemed like they've seen better days.  I ordered roast chicken which came with stuffing, and cranberry sauce and gravy and got mashed potatoes on the side.  The stuffing, potatoes, gravy and cranberry sauce, I'm convinced, all came from either a box or a can.  The chicken, I'll admit, was cooked pretty nicely, though it was a bit bland.  For dessert, I tried the ""Justly Famous"" Jewish Apple Cake.  I'm thinking the only thing famous about it might be the name on the box that it also seems to have come from.

"I really wanted to like this place. It really does have a TON of potential and I have heard good things about some of the other locations. But after two awful visits, it's safe to say I will not be returning.  Let's start with the good.  Very cool décor.  There's graffiti art around the restaurant. A very cool vibe and I really like how the windows open in the front giving it that ""outdoor-indoor feel.""   The margaritas are also very tasty. We got a flight and the pear one was delicious! The prices too are also very reasonable.  The Bad: Not a fan of the food. The first time I went was before they even opened for a sneak peak.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt since I knew they were still troubleshooting some issues and still working out all the kinks.   Keep in mind, I'm a vegetarian and ordered George's Dirty Taco and the Mantis. I don't do well with spice but could barely eat the Dirty Taco because of the sauce. As for the Mantis, it wasn't much better- it had little to no flavor.  The Service:  The first time around as I mentioned, I gave them a pass. It was the first night, servers were still training, and it was a full house.  This recent time though, it was just rough from start to finish.  It took our waitress SO long just to get our drinks, they messed up one of our orders, and then she spoke down to me in front of everyone telling me I filled out the ""scranton"" menu wrong and needed to redo it so the cooks could see what I wanted.   When I did... she never returned,  so that everyone got their food and I was stuck waiting for mine. Once again, when my food finally did come, it was disappointing to say the least.

My boyfriend is a burger connoisseur and when we saw the menu it was kind of a no brainer where we were getting lunch.   The menu has such a variety of already built burgers and chicken sandwiches (amongst other options) AND a never ending list of customizable options for either sandwich! I loveeee having so many options especially ones you don't find everywhere such a fig jam, roasted onion cream cheese, espresso BBQ sauce.... the list is never ending!  And just when we thought it couldn't get any better we saw the mac and cheese section of the menu. GET OUTTA HERE! Mac and cheese AND burgers?! Exactly what dreams are made of! Well, at least what our dreams are made of!   My boyfriend made his own burger with a side of mac and cheese and I got the Huy Fong Honey Chicken Sandwich with the hand cut fries. When it came out I was in astonishment at just how freaking nice it looked! I had never seen such a glorious sandwich on such a beautiful shiney bun before! I cannot express how excited I was just on the appearance of this sandwich. It was just one awesome thing after another at this place! I took a bite out of the sandwich and it was just magical. A sandwich that tastes as amazing as it looked! I wasn't sure if this place was real or just a figment of our imaginations. It was a messy sandwich for me, but my gosh it was tasty.   I was so excited about how good this place was that I was texting all my friends about it and making future plans to return while I was still there.

Not only was it cold but it was super dry and extremely chewy, it felt like I was eating elastic. I called back and told the person on the phone about the pizza being cold and it shouldn't have been cold considering the time frames. She offered to give me a free pizza the next time I ordered from there. Unfortunately the pizza was so bad I don't even want it for free.

"I have to say first and foremost I am a manager for a restaurant and have been in the industry for 10+ years so my review may be more in depth. Getting there, I loved to see this black owned business with a good vibe, and cleanliness. My girlfriend wanted to try this place out as we both like to support black owned businesses, but here were my issues:  Ordered the Coconut shrimp or an appetizer and the shrimp were raw. And though I'm not big on sending food back to the kitchen, (for health reasons) we decided to do so.   We decided to order our entrees (in which felt weird seeming I had to wave my bartender/server down to do so instead of having that constant checking from the server). I asked for the Lamb and instead of getting the whole order I got an add on order (less than half the amount I wanted). By the way, those lamb chops were delicious! My girlfriend ordered the shrimp and grits. After 45 minutes of waiting, she never got those grits. So we just decided to ask for the check and get food elsewhere. I know sometimes the kitchen can get backed up, however being the 2nd or 3rd party to get seated, I don't know how that would be the case. And knowing the average cook time on a shrimp and grits at any given establishment would be 15- no more than 20 minutes prep time.   We got the shrimp back and it was over cooked unfortunately as expected. So we just decided to cut our losses and leave.   Now the most important thing that I could stress and hopefully make this place better? Smiles and attentiveness. I don't believe we were greeted with a smile from the time we entered to the time we left. There was a lack of morale, a lack of ""believing in the business"". This place has the utmost potential, and being a previous resident of the area, I know how important it is in what thriving black businesses do to that community. However, great customer service and a well oiled kitchen staff can make you or break you.   Unfortunately, my girlfriend is ""one and done"" with the business, but I hope possibly in the future, I can witness the true potential this place has to offer.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

I do regret not taking the other Yelp reviews more seriously and I should have known things were not going to go well when the waitress's greeting was ""So I guess no one has come to wait on you yet.""  The Grain Bloody Mary was good. Unfortunately the olive was not blue cheese stuffed as mentioned on the menu but I can deal. Good beer list too. I feel bad for the server having to cover for the slow kitchen, but she never mentioned anything to us about a delay or with apologies or anything so my sympathy only goes so far. We did, however, hear her extending apologies to other diners complaining about the wait. I overheard the waitress mention the kitchen was ""slammed"" yet, there were a number of empty tables in the restaurant and only 2 ppl at the bar.   We weren't the only table to have gotten up to leave after 1 hour plus with no food. I can even understand it if we have complex orders...but we ordered a breakfast burrito, omelette and pancakes.

"Tonight was my first experience at Sportsman's Grille in the Vandy/Hillsboro Village area. When we arrived we were seated at a table where there were ants crawling on it. I asked the server if we could be moved and she moved us with no problem. After a minute or two at the new table (in a different part of the restaurant) I noticed ants on the new table as well. I switched my boyfriend spots (I was originally sitting against the wall) and let it go for the time being.   Two of our friends joined us and we ordered our meals. My friend ordered the Mexicana Burger with everything on the side, when it arrived it had only the salsa on the side and everything else was on it. My boyfriend ordered the bacon cheeseburger and when it came there was no bacon on it. My meal and our other friend's meal came out fine. Towards the end of the meal I noticed an ant in my coke. When the server brought us our checks I expressed my concerns about the ants on our table and in my drink, her response was simply ""Yeah...it's the summer, we're trying to work on it"" without even an apology or an offer to discount our meals.   When she came back to take our credit cards (my boyfriend and I were on one check and our other two friends were on one together) we told her we would like to split the cost of the bill down the middle on both cards (our friends did the same). About 15 minutes after she took our cards (during that time I found another ant in my water) she finally returned them with the checks to sign. I noticed that she had not split our bill correctly and in fact, the amounts on my boyfriends receipt and on mine were not the same and added up to almost $3.00 more than what the total of our bill was (our friend's receipts also added up to more than the cost of their bill).   While I'm not one to complain about $3.00, I will complain about being over charged while dining with ants on our table & in our drinks and the food not coming out correctly and it taking so long for her to run our cards. I do not recommend this place and I will not be returning.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Decided to try a new taco place today in the Funk Zone with some friends. My fiancé said ""I don't even need salsa on this burrito it's so good!"" And it filled him up good. Well worth the money. The fish taco was DELICIOUS!!! The Chicken Mole taco was DELICIOUS PART 2, and the carnitas taco was delicious part 3.

"As far as ""Mexican cuisine"" goes, this place is pretty basic.  I, however do not really judge an establishment on simply it's decor.  After all, I and most people will withstand the basic birthday party like decorations if the food is good.  I do dare to say that If you closed your eyes, it would taste about the same as any Mexican place.  The service however....... This kinda puts them toward the bottom.  Look, there are basically 3 other Mexican restaurants within 10 minutes.   But to order, have three glasses of tea, a quick change of ""more chips?"" about 4 times and still wait 55 minutes for the semi- warm food??....... Nah.  Sorry, I'm a consumer and I like good food and even better service.   I wouldn't return.  Respectfully.....",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The pad Thai was terrible! It was dry and barely had any egg or tofu and the shrimp was tasteless...I had trouble eating it. Though the other dish we had was great (Thai basil, veggie) and the appetizers were good. That was seriously the worst Pad Thai I've ever encountered, and I previously raved about it!

"RICH MAHOGANY woods, candlelit dark leather seating, the aroma of grilled steak... FLEXIBLE MENU keeps it affordable: discounted prix fixes, happy hour small plates; LOYALTY: Dickie's stayed in NOLA after Katrina; Ruth's Chris abandoned the city.  I lived and worked inside the Chicago loop almost 5 years in the 1990s. I chose Chicago because like New Orleans it's a city of neighborhoods, loyalties and quirky corny traditions. Similarly, it's also a city that loves its infamous history, particularly the roaring twenties. For me nothing more exemplifies that era than Chicago's dark, clubby steakhouses. Restaurants that still serve the same century-old menu of au gratin potatoes, wedge salads, and gin not vodka martinis. Dickie Brennan's first opened in the French Quarter about the time I returned home. And, more than any other in the city, it reminds me most of what a ""big shouldered"" steakhouse should be: the highest quality beef, straight forward cocktails and a hearty reinterpretation of that burly age.    COOLINARY GOLD STAR: by far one of the best values for an amazing meal: shrimp and smoked peach mesclun salad, perfectly panéed veal with grilled asparagus, and a weighty bananas foster bread pudding: $35 - now there's a restaurateur that knows how to treat his locals!

"The inconsistency of this establishment is AMAZING! Third review I've written, and very different from the previous two. I wanna love this place so much, and I do think the food is great! Except for the fact that they're always missing the details. Over 3 times they've forgot a drink or chips of mine with a delivery order and for the second time they've forgotten an item on their sandwich. I asked them which sandwiches had pineapple on them and they said the Thai Stick did, so I ordered that. I got my sandwich to go and when I unwrapped it at home, guess what? Yeah, no pineapples. They also forgot the bell peppers and the cheese. I'm sorry, but with how inconsistent they are, I would rather go to Jimmy Johns where it's a 1/4 of the wait, and always exactly what I ordered.  Edit: I found the pineapple! One piece buried in the bread.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Yummy!   First of all, before going to this place, I believe that people need to know that this is NOT an authentic Mexican taco place. I feel like many people go in with that kind of mindset and come out disappointed.  With that being said. You can build your own taco here or you can order off of their speciality menu. I always go off the specialty menu and have loved all the tacos I've tried! My favorite, and the one I would recommend to everyone would be Lucy's Fire. Their drinks and app menu is fairly big as well. Their regular, lime margarita is delicious!  Also, they recently opened a location on Mass Ave. and it looks great! Overall, would definitely come again.  Tip 1: They have $5 House Margaritas from Monday-Friday.  Tip 2: Happy Hour is Monday-Friday from 4-7pm. Go to get $1 off all tacos!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I am also a very big fan of Turkish food... so though I was disappointed to see Aromatic gone, I was still excited to have the change for Turkish.  I cannot express how sad I am that I ate here.  Nothing was right.  The rice was full of oil.. so gross, my kabob was dry and terrible and instead of the spicy roasted hot peppers (a big part of Turkish food) they tried to give me bell peppers as a replacement... even though the photo of the dish on their menu showed the traditional hot peppers.

The good:  Friendly efficient service and a reasonably good margarita.  The guacamole was OK but nothing spectacular.  I went out on a limb and ordered the seafood fajitas.  I was intrigued because it's not something I have  seen anywhere else.  I don't think it's a very popular choice because it seemed like all the seafood came out of the frozen section and wasn't very tasteful.  Same for their interpretation of shrimp tacos.  Interesting looking now at the online menu neither option we ate is on the menu now....  Maybe they are getting things sorted.  We gave it a try but probably would go back to El Rodeo for a comparable meal.  For a tier above we'll go into Indy for La Margarita or Delicia,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Never, ever eat before you come to Half & Half. The mere portions of their delicious food will leave you full for the rest of the day. Pair that with bottomless coffee or one of their delicious house lattes, and you truly have the perfect brunch experience.   Every time I come to Half & Half it is packed, but that doesn't take away from it's homey, farm-fresh atmosphere. The crowd is typically a mix of families, couples, and groups of young people, especially many college students from Wash U nearby.   My go-to entree is now the Sausage Biscuit, which is an oversized flaky biscuit loaded with spicy sausage, fluffy eggs, and cheese. It comes with a side of breakfast potatoes but I've never been able to make it through this ultimate carbo-load, though I have tried because it is so delicious.   Be sure to always check what their specials are on weekends, there is almost always a really unique French toast or a special hash that's loaded with flavor. And if you're feeling especially hungry or adventurous, try an order of doughnuts as an appetizer as you drink a Vanilla latte. You might forget where you because it's so good that it's all you can think about.   One more recommendation for first-timers, be sure to get on the waitlist ahead of time. If you show up anytime near peak hours, you will probably be waiting for at least 45 minutes. Regardless, Half & Half is worth every second spent.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

I get annoyed but eat the hoagie anyways. The second time (and LAST) I stopped in to this particular Wawa my hoagie once again felt light. I ordered a veggie hoagie with LOTS of veggies only to find out when I get home that it's only lettuce, onions, cheese and bread. Do they not understand what vegetables are???

(i could see if it was noon and crowded)   i will just mention that as a vegan i am upset w/ the labeling of the menu and clarity over what is vegan and what is not.   1) they make the tofu scramble w/ actual BUTTER.  2) the soy sausage is NOT vegan  3) the potatoes are NOT vegan   which makes the ""tofu scramble"" dish on the menu- marked with a clean green V - not actually VEGAN -  you have to tweak it here.   i wish the servers were more up on things and more informed of what is vegan and what isnt.  its *always* my pet peeve when the staff doesnt actually know whats in the meals they are serving.   either way the portions are HUGE, the food is tasty, the prices are affordable, and the location is great.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Not only was the delivery late, the sandwich was put together with globs of mayo which by no means was an average amount. It was literally oozing out all the sides. The bread was soggy by the time it reached me almost an hour later. How can they mess up a sandwich? Come on, it's what they do!  Terrible. Will never order here again.

"I was quite unwhelmed by the food and it was not worth the price in my opinion.  The restaurant is quite dark so makes it difficult to see menu and the food well. We ordered appetizers, had fried calamari and beef carpaccio. The fried calamari was under cooked. The breading was falling off the calamari and it was not crispy and just looked unappetizing.  I should have sent it back, but we didn't. Also I order beef carpaccio. I was not impressed with that either. The menu said it came with shaved black truffles, Piave cheese, truffle aioli, and micro arugula. The Piave cheese was there as was the truffle aioli and micro greens, however there was no shaved black truffles that I could see. Also the beef had no flavor. I needed to add salt.  Dinner came and both my companions had prime rib. They said it was ok, but it was a bit tough. I had Scallops. They were under cooked. Not much of a sear on all of them. The best part of the dining experience was at the end.  We had a tasting flight of Port. The gentleman who brought my wine and the Port flight was excellent. He was great and was our server.  So service and the Port saved this experience because the food was not so great and definitely not worth the price.  Probably won't go back because it is just too pricey for what you get.  I do need to add that the bacon cheese bread is very good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"The wife, kid, and I found this place while at the public beach access for St. Pete's Beach.  It was right across the street from the beach so we walked over and figured, ""Hey, pizza works, you really can't screw up pizza""   Their pizza was fantastic, pizza by the slice where big slices with great toppings and hand-tossed dough.  They also have calzones and sandwiches, and other italian favorites; manicotti, alfredo, calamari, and bruschetta.  If they do the rest of their food like their pizza then the rest of their food is divine.   I highly recommmend this place to all the locals in St. Petersburg or St. Pete's Beach.

Luckily they give you ketchup packets to go with the fries. Cheesesteak was okay. Really like the hoagie bread it came on. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

"Street Side has been in my bookmarked folder for some time now and on a hot Saturday afternoon in July we made our way over to Girard. Street Side is a little hard to find and a little nondescript. The place is located across the street from Paesano's and almost next door to Moda Mia. The restaurant is trendier then most Viet places inside and it has a younger feel. There is seating downstairs and also upstairs. It is very casual and clean.  We were sort of in between lunch and dinner so we ordered a few things to be shared by 3 people. The Lemon Grass Bahn Mi, Garlic Shrimp Spring Roll, the traditional paper wrap and combo brisket Pho. Everything was really good and tasted fresh. The Bahn Mi bread was excellent. The Pho broth was light but still flavorful. I had an ice coffee, which hit the spot on a hot day, and we also tried the citrus coconut and cucumber drink and honey basil seed drink. Both of these were refreshing. We ended our meal happily with Asian sugar doughnuts and Coconut pudding. All of this was about $36.00. Not too bad at all for the quality and freshness of the food.

To make this short, it was the Ravioli. The catch here is I was not told that the meatballs and salad didn't come with the meal. I assumed it did being my partners did. I don't care to out the waitress but she should have said ""would you like to add meatballs and salad"" or state that the Ravioli was l la carte but she didn't and when we got the bill the meatballs and salad where extra. I didn't mind paying for it but anyone in hospitality should never assume it's ok and up sell consumers like that.

With limited seating indoors, you wouldn't think it would be hard to wipe them clean of obvious debris...Apparently it is.  The food was overly processed and left me wishing I hadn't.

"Don't understand the hype on this place - other than the patio has really nice ambiance. The staff is friendly enough, but the food is mediocre, at best. My husband and i are total foodies - and love all types of food from fancy to BBQ shack. We ordered the garlic soup Yelpers gave good reviews to - but it really was plain jane stuff. The plain green salad w/ blue cheese was good. We ordered the duck and the lamb dishes - both also given decent/good reviews by Yelpers. The duck was less than decent. The lamb was pretty good (best part was the sweet potato side), but neither dish measured up to the amazing food you can find in this amazing city. I would HIGHLY recommend u not waste your time or money (and believe me - i hardly ever review a restaurant this harshly - but this place is a waste of time for your taste buds!!).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
I was really looking forward to having a good experience as I live nearby and wanted something within walking distance for the winter.  I am disappointed to say that my first experience was not good. I ordered the chicken wrapped prosciutto. It's a pricey item but I'm happy to pay for good food. What I was served was a thin schnitzel style chicken. I'm not sure where the prosciutto was.  The wine selection was limited so I thought I'd have a rye. There were many bourbons but only 2 true ryes.  The interior hard surfaces make for a loud atmosphere.  In my view the atmosphere of old brick was lost by the choice to paint it white.  There is lots parking.  I won't go back for an evening experience but I may give the breakfast a try and see if that's better.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I am not a regular customer, so I cannot comment on most of the food.  One dish that appears to be popular is a breaded fried fish dinner with cheese sauce on top.  The place is far from fancy, and small inside. The tables are close together, so it is sometimes hard for customers to get in and out without bumping into other tables.  This is a family owned business, and the owners seem very nice. The table service is decent.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"With all the options, skip this one. I was very excited to come here as it was highly recommended. Unfortunately, the food left me quite disappointed. The dining experience begins with the salsa -- a young lady comes to the table to mix it for you. Our lass did not smile once, despite having a BIG sign and envelope asking for tips.  First ingredient - CANNED TOMATOES!!  Oh my goodness, horrible!!  (And if they're not canned, they surely tasted like supermarket canned tomatoes!!) The chips to enjoy this salsa with also tasted like bagged supermarket chips. Next, I asked for a Mexican soft drink (after all, this is labeled as authentic Mexican).  No Jarritos, no Sidral, nothing authentic.  Second disappointment. Next up - the food.  I ordered one of their combo platters that brought carne asada, a chile relleno, and an enchilada, and requested a pork tamale on the side additionally.  The carne asada had no flavor (not even that of a grilled steak), the chile relleno did not seem fresh as if it had been fried a while ago and reheated.   Honestly, quite the disappointment.  With so much competition (Mexican restaurants are found everywhere in Tucson), you'd think this establishment would want to excel in quality.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I ate here for the first time recently with a co-worker and had a really nice experience.  First off, some advice: sign up for their mailing list, holy discounts galore.  My co-worker and I signed up.  I immediately got $10 off and order of two pasta entrees large or small.  Then she received a coupon for a FREE pasta meal.  Perfect.  So we went and were greeted with fast service.  The hostess showed us around and walked us through the kitchen, pretty neat!  All the decor is really fun old-school Italian diner style, I liked it.  She took us to our table where our server quickly tended to us.  We showed her our free pasta coupon and ordered some side salads to go with it.  A few minutes later she brought delicious warm bread and oil to dip it in, yummmmmm.  A little bit later she brought our salads, a nice little Caesar for me, perfect amount of dressing, crunchy lettuce, big croutons.  Then she brought our giant ""small"" bowl of pasta.  We both ate and had seconds and enough to take home, bread too!  We ordered the Alfredo, it was pretty good, I liked the pasta.  It was very simple though, nothing thrilling, but I was more than happy with it considering it was free.  The left overs made for a fantastic lunch a few days later.  Our bill? $6, we split it, $3 is pretty damn good for a very filling lunch.  We WILL be back.... with a coupon!!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

I came for Taco Tuesday, I thought this was going to be the best part of my day! $4 off 1 dozen oysters or $2 off 1/2 a dozen. $1.50 for meat tacos. $8/3 seafood tacos.   Original charoysters ($17.95) - so much cheese! I liked this. The size of the oysters threw me off. Some were huge and some were the size of my thumb nail. Guess it evens out?   Raw oysters ($7.95/half dozen)  Grilled mahi-mahi - wow. DRY! It came with some type of sauce, jicama, cotija cheese, and some other stuff. I only ate a few pieces of fish off this. So I can't tell you if all the toppings and sauce went well with it. My boyfriend did and he couldn't get over how dry the fish was.   Grilled Baja shrimp - topped with the same stuff as the mahi mahi. I think that I'm not a fan of cotija cheese or some other topping on the tacos. Because I wanted to spit this out.   Barbacao - no flavor and extremely dry.   Carne asada - slightly flavorful and extremely dry.   Pork cracklings with red salsa - extremely dry, but the salsa kinda helped. Not crunchy or crackling-ly.   They shouldn't use large tortillas if they're not going to even cover a quarter of it. Use smaller tortillas!

"I was born and raised in Alton and during high school, Tony's was the 'go to' place for the greatest pizza ever.   I don't live in Alton now and just visit a couple times a year.  Last weekend, 6 of us went to Tony's for dinner in the bar.  My 'local' friends, tried to suggest other places, but I was determined to go.  Since it was Sunday, the restaurant had a great pasta special--salad, pasta and glass of wine for $10.  The ladies in our group got the special.  The guys--one ordered a pizza, another wanted the portobello mushroom sandwich, and the other guy got a sandwich as well.  One of the guys also ordered a beer--from the list located on the wall.  The waitress comes back and first tells one guy- they are out of mushrooms, so he ordered another sandwich, the next guy was told they were out of the beer he ordered, and finally, the guy who ordered pizza was told, they were out of hamburger, so they could not make him the pizza with that topping!    Now how can a restaurant run out of hamburger!  And why was the beer they were out of removed from the chalk board sign?   Anyway, We plan another trip back next month, and I will not be returning.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"I let several hours go by before I sat down to write this review. I have been wanting to check out Alma, and we finally made it over there for a late brunch today. It looked like there would be a long wait, even at 1:00, but in only about 5 minutes we were seated inside. Off to a good start! The three of us ordered coffees and set about trying to make food decisions, which was hard. We wanted to try everything! It took at least 20 minutes for us to get our coffees, probably longer, but they were so delicious we moved on. We told our server we wanted the meat pies as an appetizer to calm our hunger,  put in our entrée orders, and settled in to wait. Unlike other restaurants I've dined in this year, staffing didn't seem to be an issue for Alma at all. So was it a kitchen problem or a server problem that we didn't get food for an HOUR? We watched tables all around us get theirs and mentioned it to our server several times...when it did finally appear two dishes were missing the additional chorizo and the appetizer meat pies NEVER came. She brought them out after we had our entrees, though she could have taken them off the bill for all we cared at that point. No apologies for the ridiculous wait time for food or for how screwed up everything was, just an automatic 18% tip that wasn't deserved.

"We went to Gio Taco Friday it was my first time eating at Gio and I didn't like it.   We got in line and started looking at the menu. We were glad it was happy hour and draft beer was half off. I ordered a Dragoon Ale, a good deal at $3.00.   This is an overly complicated menu. It is just tacos, and other similar items. I can sum it up as a few ingredients rearranged to make a menu worth of options. It sounds simple but is organized so you have to look in a couple different places (or panels on the wall) just to order tacos. Pick your meat, tortilla, and toppings. By the way the toppings, queso fresco, corn, and mango, cost $.25 each. The tacos already cost $2.50 each. Please don't charge extra for the toppings.   We ordered the blue crema steak taco, a Korean beef taco with mango topping, and a veggie taco with corn topping. They forgot the corn topping on the veggie taco but we didn't say anything. We also ordered an order of plantain chips and two happy hour beers.   So, we ordered three tacos, two happy hour beers, and an order of plantain chips and it cost over $20 That is too much for what we got.   The biggest problem was the bad tortillas. The corn tortillas had be fried or dipped in oil. They were tough and hard to eat, not good at all.   The plantain chips were tasty but most of the order was just tiny pieces. I would have liked less broken chips.   The place was crowded and tables were being reserved for a big group so people who came in after us didn't know where to sit. It was too cold to sit outside, where most of the seating area is. The view, or lack there of, reminds me of eating at the mall. You can't see anything other than other corporate looking restaurants.   There are many good restaurants and bars downtown. There are many places to get good tacos in Tucson. I don't think I will be back to Gio Taco.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The wait staff is usually okay and could be more detailed and attentive.  There was a bug in my drink for example.   The food is good and I never get sick but it makes you wonder what the kitchen looks like if the dining room is gross.

"Yet another dive bar with nothing to offer other than average pub food and drinks poured in glasses that you gotta make sure are clean before you sip out of. The last time I actually came here I spent 10 minutes sitting at a table, unnoticed by the staff, and ended up just leaving.   I had a BLT & fries the one time I had visited before that, and the food was okay, as was the server (who has since quit), but this place is a dump, let's face it.   It looks like it was converted from somebody's basement, decorated with VLT machines, bad lighting and ugly furniture from decades past. A little TLC could go a long way in this place, but like so many other dives, the owners seem to have their priorities elsewhere. Pass!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"I came in here for a quick coffee. I was touring Philly during my 4 hour layover from Lancaster to Jax and decided I would come in here for a coffee, rest and some charging of my phone (my phone was a mess that weekend).  Frankly, I was shocked to see that this store seemed so dismally boring and uninviting. First, as I went to look for a yummy flavored Colombian-brew, they did not have any in the thermos. I had to make my way around a guy who seemed desperately unamused and sweeping the floor while people were trying to hustle around him for their fountain drinks or fresh squeezed lemonade.   The cashier was not friendly, nor were any of the other people who were there. I didn't even want to order food on account of the unhappy associates.   I used the bathroom and it smelled bad and it was not clean. I don't know if they don't see homeless people using the facilities or if people that go in there are just downright disgusting, but I will not choose to pee here again...  This may be convenient for those who are coming in from work since it's right in the midst of the financial district of Philly, but for me it was a visit that left a sour taste in my mouth. Oh, never mind, that was actually the lemonade.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

We got there early for a 7:45 dinner and were told that the small bar downstairs was filled and we would have to wait on the front porch. As it turned out the bar was very large with many seats available- they just didn't offer them to us. We had a drink on the porch and the sassy girl at the front desk said they were holding the bar seats for ""other reserved customers "". I guess her snotty demeanor turned me off from the very start.   The food is well prepared and tasty. I had the meat () and my husband the chic which he loved. We all had starters and shared one dessert  and  2 bottles of house priced wine. The best part for me was the chocolate cake. The service is attentive- so much information is given on the food preparation it makes your head spin. If you are a new foodie with deep pockets this is the place for you.

"I had mixed feelings after eating here.    First, the service was below average.  There was nobody to greet us when we got in and even after going upstairs, our waiter seemed at a complete loss as to what to do when I told him we had no reservations, and wound up gesturing towards the tables and mumbling 'I guess there's a table open over there'.  I think he might have been the only waiter there and so was super busy, but whatever the case it wasn't impressive.  The bread and garlic spread was a mixed bag.  The spread was actually really good if a bit on the strong side, but the bread was very dry and just about required a drink after each slice.  Whoever had cut it had done a poor job as well as we had to finish cutting each slice to get it off the loaf.  We had their gouda quesadilla for an appetizer, and that was easily the best part of the meal.  It was pretty simple, just gouda, prosciutto and caramelized onion, but the flavours all blended very nicely and made for an excellent overall dish.  I had the chicken parmesan, and it was about as bog standard as it gets for chicken parmesan.  I've had better, I've had worse.  The pasta was a big disappointment.  It was thick and rubbery and not served with enough sauce so it was mostly flavourless as well.  Pasta is one of those things that you really have to be able to do well as an Italian restaurant, and this just didn't make the grade.  In the end, the place was really a mixed bag.  My entrée was competent, but boring, the pasta was straight up bad, but the gouda quesadilla was not only interesting, but delicious.  If more of their food was like that, something that I couldn't get at a thousand other Italian restaurants, I'd be back in a heartbeat, but as-is, I'm not sure I'll be coming back any time soon.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"This is exactly what street food in Tucson should be like.  The menu points you to the obvious choice: a ""New"" Karamelo King ($4.50) complete with cheese, cabbage, grilled onions, beans, avocado slices, and either carne asada or chicken.  I got mine with carne asada, and...well...wow.  Everything about it was amazing.  I paired my caramelo with a cold bottle of Mexican apple soda ($1.75 -- regular soda is $1), stopped by the little metal condiment cart for some toppings, and sat down at a shaded plastic table to relish my tiny feast.  Simply awesome.  I was only there for a mid-afternoon snack, so the caramelo was just enough to satisfy me.

The decor is pretty yet understated and the restaurant itself is not very large. I see this being good for a romantic date or a small dinner with 3 or 4 friends. Don't forget to BYOB!  The food was good. I was not a huge fan of my mussels but everything else was great and the food was very fresh. The $26.00 prix fix menu was definitely worth it. And when the waitress tells you that each plate is a few bites (tapas) she is lying... there was definitely enough food on each plate to be a meal for me.

I have been to this place several times (only cuz I live nearby and sometimes the better places are just too busy), and it is one of the most outrageously priced places in Nola for the quality level of food you get.  I cant recall ever leaving this place satisfied. Usually it is not terrible enough to swear off forever, but I then avoid it for 7 or 8 months until I forget how mediocre it is and I am forced to settle for it again. Every time I try something new because nothing has ever warranted eating twice, although the spinach and artichoke dip is decent for an appetizer. Tonight, I tried the 'Chicken Hunter', and it was easily the worst dish I have EVER been served in a restaurant. It was advertised as chicken over pasta with garlic, onions, tomato sauce, and rosemary. It tasted like this was the dish to start, someone ate it, digested it, and then shit it out onto the plate and they then served it to me. The smell was so awful I almost didnt even taste it, but for $17 I forced myself to, and spit it out. I offered a bite to my friend and it got the same reaction. I then threw it away.  There was nothing wrong with the dish, it wasnt sour or rotten or anything, it was just horrible cooking. How can a chef serve SHIT like this not fit for a dog? Because there is no chef. Just a bunch of low wage cooks who dont really care how it tastes. One of those cooks or a waiter or someone should suggest taking 'Chicken Hunter' off the menu because it takes like eating raw asshole.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I've picked up from Taqueria Corona about 3 times now.  It's our go-to spot for take out Mexican.  Admittedly, we haven't found a lot of good Mexican restaurants in Uptown.  Go figure.    We order mostly the fish tacos which are respectable.  In fact, it's the only taco that we have liked from Taqueria Corona.  The carne asada is pretty pathetic.  The tortilla is decent, so they are halfway there.  But the meat is dry and not well seasoned.  So the saving grace of TC is their fish tacos.  My cousin who recommended the place told me not to waste my time with anything but the fish tacos.  He's an idiot, so of course I ordered other stuff.  Turns out he is a genius.  Only the fish tacos are good. And they are just good, not killer.  They have a respectable few thick pieces of unknown fish lightly battered and served under a spicy tarter sauce.  I'd rate them a 3.5/5.    The people are nice and food is reasonably priced.  Stick with the fish tacos and you should have a very decent meal.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The hamburger bun was burnt (not a little but black) and they had the guts to actually serve it. The salmon in the salmon sandwich still had the skin on.  Remove the skin before putting in the sandwich.  The calamari was more like giant squid and very leathery like chewing rubber.  The halibut and vegetables were mushy.  I do not know why this restaurant is so highly rated. If you see the giant squid.....run.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I have been to Not Your Average Joe's a number of times now, and until tonight I was very pleased with my experiences. My girlfriend has several food allergies, so we like that Joe's caters to her food preferences.   As for tonight, I took my girlfriend and her sister who is in from Colorado to Joe's because we were raving about how great it was, and I am so incredibly disappointed with everything from start to finish. Having worked in the restaurant industry as a server for 6 years now, I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt. The hostesses were nice, not overly friendly but good enough. Our waitress started out nice, pretty talkative but that's okay. Took her over 5 minutes to greet us. Took 20 minutes to even get our drinks on the table. Our appetizer of fries was delivered before we even had waters or our bar drinks delivered. She explained that they were incredibly busy, but things kept getting worse. I ordered a side salad which I did not get until an hour and a half after we sat down!! For a salad, for lettuce and tomatoes on a plate, it took that long. I approached one manager to tell him it had been 20 minutes since we had drinks and he was nice about that. I had to go to the bar to order myself another drink because our waitress disappeared. She kept checking back with us asking about what we ordered because I guess she lost our order. Our food finally got delivered at 8:15 when we were seated at 6:30! Everything was wrong. Burger was burnt. Chicken came without fries and was extremely salty. One member of my group couldn't even eat it. Steak on the salad was disgusting. The manager made things better by giving us gift cards to use next time, but honestly I do not think we will be back. It was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant in a very long time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"This Denny's has really declined over the past year; particularly with the night crew. The service is absolutely terrible, and the employees make it obvious they don't care. I went in last night around 1:30. The place was pretty full, and there were two waitresses on duty. They were talking amongst themselves near the front. No one offered to seat me, so I sat at the closest availble table. One of them came over and said the kitchen was closed, although people were clearly eating. There were also no closed signs or notices to inform the pubIic of any issues with the kitchen. I was disappointed because I came in around the same time a week prior, and left the blonde waitress a nice tip after my friend and I finished our meal. This was purely poor service.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

I realize the resort was 100% sold out, so my 1 star has nothing to do with waiting for golf carts or anything like that.

"Went to dinner for my wife's birthday and happened upon Anton's. This was a great find. Classic bar in the Swan hotel served an equally classic Manhattan while we waited for our table. We started with an excellent grilled asparagus risotto followed by a pear and gorgonzola salad.  This was one of the best salads I've had in while.  I had the petite filet (with more gorgonzola) for my entree and my wife ordered a vegetable plate.  Both presentation and flavor showed that the chef truly cared about his product. We finished with the chipotle chocolate cake, absolutely incredible...definitely a winner.   I would have given it 5 stars but the only downside was our server who really lacked personality.

"First attempt at eating at the new location.  I say attempt because we never got our food.  An hour and a half is to long to wait for your food.  The management needs major revamping.  You can't expect the bartender to make drinks for the whole restaurant, wait on customers at the bar and also wait on 6 tables. She even had to go to the kitchen to pick up the food that her patrons ordered.    It is a recipe for disaster, which is what it was.  It was a busy evening and was happy to see that for them but I doubt that it will stay that busy when you can't get your food.  We weren't alone, all the patrons sitting around us were upset with the service and the quality of the food they did receive. Maybe we will give them a few months and try again.

Me and my guest finished our water and put it at the end so the waiter could see it and we had to call the waiter over after 10mins because my friend started to cough while eating her food but had no water. I asked the waiter for water and she said she would get more. She walked off and I seen her talking to her fellow staff at the distance laughing and talking , after another 10mins she came back over (with no water) and asked how is everything doing and we said we are still waiting for the water. She left again to get the water and I seen her again at a distance fumbling around in her purse looking for something and I'm just sitting there like ‍‍‍, are you serious. Water literally is the faster thing you can get a table. You finally brought it over after waiting almost 20mins total. I drunk the water so fast in thirst it was insane. If you ever go there, dont expect fast service at all. I rather sit at the bar where your waiter is right there, other than that it's a no.

"Ok, there are a few elements to South to be reviewed.   First is the ""club"" side, which you will get after 9 on Fri and Sat.  I am not one to typically like dancing and the trash that usually follows that music, but I was really pleasantly surprised with South at night. The crowd is upscale, there is a small cover and dress code, and the music was fab. A lot of 90's early 00's hip hop mixed in with some of the catchier recent hits. Kept the ladies dancing all night.   I have also been here for food. The food itself was well above average. I had the fish and chips, made with catfish. I am not one to normally enjoy catfish, but I was told I had to try it and it was delish. Problem occurred about a bit later when I felt like someone had stabbed my stomach and I projectile vomited everywhere.   I don't want to pass final judgement on the food until I go back, because I have good friends who eat here frequently and have never had an issue. It may have just been a bum piece of fish. If the food sits as well as it tastes next time, I will drop 5 stars on South, as everything else is spot on.

"Time for an update...I was really surprised to see Carmelitas down to 3 stars, until we stopped tonight. Hopefully, Jose, the manager reads this and makes some changes before they have no business at all.  This has been a twice a month stop for the last two years.  Although we have seen service slip a bit over the last six months, I thought it was just a bad spell.  But it has gotten so bad, I'm not going to waste my money here despite the decent food.  Service is slow, but on a Wednesday night with two guests in the restaurant it shouldn't have been this bad.  While our server sat at a table in the other section we waited and waited and waited and waited.  She was more interested in watching TV and drinking soda, she truly neglected her job.  We observed a gentleman come in and be seated.. He waited nearly ten minutes by himself.  The rude server told him that he could not get the fajita special for some reason...but that he could pay full price.  As he got up to walk out, he commented that he understands why there were only two people in at dinner time.  He will probably never return, over what?? a $2 difference??  Dinner was ok...I asked for raw onions on my taco salad...apparently that is an extra...50 cents extra for 6 to 8 small pieces of onion...and there was no lettuce in the salad.

"From the looks of the other reviews, perhaps I have to give SFP another chance.   My friends brought me a burrito from here, which I was really excited to try, but when I bit into it, I got a mouthful of nothing by white rice. As I ate through the burrito, the other flavors slowly faded into existence as I approach the center, where the the majority of the unevenly distributed filling found its residence. When I got to the other end of the burrito, it faded back to rice again. I could tell that it would have been very good had it been better prepared, but for a $7 burrito, I was pretty underwhelmed. If I'm going to spend $7 on a burrito, I will go to Don Memo's food cart, who has the best burrito in West Phila.   Their menu, ranging from pho through coq au vin, does look quite creative, though.

"Large and impressive wine selection, excellent service with beautiful but over salted food. They recently got a new chef and perhaps are working out some kinks in the seasoning department?   We got caught in a downpour on our way to Third Man Records and were looking for a nearby restaurant to dine at while we waited out the rain. Flyte was a few blocks away and bonus, they have a happy hour running until 7pm.   We grabbed a seat at their large bar and were promptly greeted by Tommy who I assume is both a bartender and bar manager. He was super knowledgable about their 6 paged wine list and made some suggestions to pair with our meal. I started off with their Tempranillo ($6 on happy hour and delicious) and Jesse ordered a whisky smash. The food happy hour was made up of small bar bites so we both opted for the full dinner menu. Jesse ordered the Chicory Pork Belly and red grouper stew and I went with the Atlantic red grouper entree. While our dishes were good they were wayyy to salty. I tasted the pork belly and found it dry, salty and a very small portion. The stew was light with a hint of citrus. The grouper was prepared lightly seared on a bed of sea island red peas, red Russian Kale and shaving of preserved lemon. While the grouper was cooked well it was salty however the island red peas and Russian kale were absolutely delicious.

But the worst thing was that at the end of the meal, we had been looking forward to eating the yeasty bread ( injera ) that had been sitting under the dishes on the large platter as it had sopped up all the juices and looked yummy, it was not ! It had a really weird chemical taste, very overpowering and we were concerned that it could be unsafe to eat, as the platter the food was served on was plastic and I have no idea if it was food grade plastic, especially with having acidic food on top which  leaches stuff out. I would have told the owner, but she seemd very unreceptive to any  input, as demonstrated earlier.

"I'm usually reluctant to try non-chain Italian restaurants because you never know what you're going to get with the tomato-based sauce. Years ago, I tried a different restaurant in the French Quarter and hated the meal so much I couldn't even finish it. I hate sweet spaghetti sauce. Well, we got a flyer for Stella's in the mail and my family wanted to try it. So we did today.  The restaurant is small, but very clean. Seating is comfortable. I appreciate both of those in a restaurant.  Since I was unsure of whether they had a sweet sauce, I went ahead and ordered a small pizza. Thin crust which I really like. Ate half and took the other half home. One family member ordered a meatball sandwich and so I decided to taste a bit of the meat and was happy to find a savory sauce used. I was also impressed with the way the meatballs were smashed down between the bread. To me, that makes a better sandwich because every bite is full of meatball and a whole ball isn't going to fall out onto your plate.  Definitely would return. Or even try delivery as they have a HUGE delivery area.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Delicious, spicy, great flavor profiles.  I ordered the vegetable fresh rolls, wonton soup and lamb (ground pork) salad.   Wow. As one always hopes for with Thai food, the flavors danced on my palate and invigorated my senses.   The fresh rolls were expertly rolled, rather large, and the veggies were balanced. The spicy sweet sauce was much better than many other restaurants which often tend toward a super sweet syrupy sauce. This one was tangy and of a thinner consistency. Loved them.  Wonton soup. I would not usually order a dish typically associated with Americanized Chinese food from a Thai restaurant, but boy am I glad I did. I was intrigued by the description on the menu which described a wonton soup with fish sauce, cilantro and bean sprouts...soundly very Thai-like in nature. It did not disappoint. The broth was delicate in flavor and complemented by the meaty chicken wontons. There was no doubt that this tasty soup was a Thai inspiration.  The larb salad was the highlight of the meal. Fresh and crisp cabbage, thinly sliced red onion, crunchy peanuts and sliced green onion balanced with the ground pork, fish sauce and lime juice to make one of the best larb salads I've had the pleasure of eating. I enjoyed being able to get it Thai hot, and it was that. Not overly seasoned, but a balanced spice to still bring out the key flavors of the dish.  All at a reasonable price point: $4 rolls, $8 salad and $4 soup.  I will definitely be ordering from here again.  (I was super hungry and forgot to take pictures first...my bad.  Ordered from here off of BiteSquad for office delivery, so I can't comment on the locale itself.)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I was so bummed by our experience here because I had really high hopes after hearing great things!  To be fair, it's possible that we didn't order the right things (although the menu is fairly small and one-note for a sharing multiple plates type of restaurant).    Everything had the same note of salty and heavy and not much else.  At an individual plate level, I thought a simple touch of green apple or other acid could've perked up a dish.  But after five or six plates of the exact same, it was pretty clear that this is just the chef's taste.  The best dish we had was the dessert - bitter grapefruit sorbet.  It was really well balanced with bitter, sweet, and sour and provided much-needed lightness after such a fatty, heavy meal.  The worst dish was the special of the night.  It was a cassoulet with duck, lamb, and pork.  I imagined a cassoulet with a piece of duck, a piece of pork belly, and maybe a lamb sausage.  Nope!  It was a bowl of slightly undercooked white beans topped with chopped up meat.  Sometimes I worry that the special of the night is a way to use up leftovers from the restaurant.  This was definitely 100% leftovers - just bits of meat that didn't make the cut into other dishes.  On top of the food, I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere.  Service was professional (although we had one long stretch waiting with no food on the table), but it felt like everyone was too cool for me.  Not especially friendly or attentive.

Can't give it a 1 star since I did not get to eat anything. I was pretty exited to go here and drove from the east side just for it. We were checking the menu and just got our waters. One cup had a white chunk of what looked like cheese floating in it and the other had red bits of something on both inside and out. I asked for a couple new glasses and showed what was inside. Then waitress brings me two new glasses with particles on both glasses again. I canceled my appetizer and left before I got some sorta stomach bug. I really want to give this place a one star but can't since I didn't eat or drink anything.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Ordered breakfast from here for the first time. Pros: fast delivery, home fries were good. Cons: eggs had no flavor and the pork roll was greasy. Also, this just my preference, but the pork roll wasn't cooked well enough for me even after they were asked to. Overall I would probably order from here again but will just stay away from the eggs and pork roll.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Came here on a recommendation of a friend. The wine selection was pretty bad. Navigated around the menu and all were pretty cheap (quality not price).  First came the garlic bread. The waitress said it was  ""complementary"", however I cannot think of anything nice to say about it at all. In fact I'm highly suspicious of whether it was really even bread? I believe it was just some really big croutons that put on some butter and were masquerading as bread. I was not fooled!   The salad was bad as well. Huge chunks of romain with a very lemony Italian dressing haphazardly splashed on the plate in a way that was drowning one half of the salad and non-existent on the rest.   For dinner, we selected the grouper with Ocean sauce. This was actually quite good. Unfortunately, the wine, crouton-bread, salad and service were a little too much for that tasty, yet outmatched, fish to overcome.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"At $11 a pop, I wasn't expecting frozen beef.   For an hour's wait, I wasn't expecting an underseasoned sandwich.   I was so excited for my first authentic Philly cheesesteak experience. Our tour guide, who said he was a naive Philadelphian, said this was the place to go. I was even happier that it was in one of my favorite places in the city: Reading Terminal Market.   The line was outrageous. Nearly 40 people ahead of us on a Sunday around 2:30pm. But, I figured, if our tour guide recommended it, it has 4 stars on Yelp, the line was crazy long and Obama had eaten here before, it must be worth it.   Cue: the biggest letdown in my recent culinary memory.   We ordered the original with hot peppers. This was decent, but lacked seasoning and was sorely lacking on the wiz. It was a tiny schmear at the bottom of the bun. I so wanted to be oohed and awed at some meat+wiz gooey cheesiness that I've read about and seen in so many photos of delectable cheesesteaks. But this did not deliver.   Husband and I always order two different dishes, to maximize our tasting efforts, and then go halfsies (this is basically the best part of marriage, amirite?) I combed through reviews and saw several people enjoyed the Italian cheesesteak, with sharp provolone cheese and broccoli rabe. I was enticed to try something off the beaten path and saw that many other people had ordered the same, so I decided to pull the trigger and get some greens on my meat. Boy, was that a mistake. Both my husband and I could barely finish our halves. The flavor was just so completely off. When I make a decision to eat meat (I am flexitarian and follow a plant-based diet about 85% of the time), I really want it to be worth it. But between spending an hour of my life on line, $25 for two sandwiches, on top of the fact that we had been touring the city all day and I was ravenously hungry, I forced myself to finish it beyond my own desires.   I've had much better cheesesteaks outside of Philly, sad to say.  It hurts to give this one star if only because the staff were really friendly, despite the never ending line. They were grilling and prepping the sandwiches faster than humanely possible. I rarely tip at a take-away counter but I did so here just because I was in awe of their speed and the fact that they still were pleasant and smiling after serving hundreds of cheesesteaks all day. I just wish one of them warned me against the Italian and told me to get extra meat and extra cheese on the original.  -4 stars for the overly lengthy wait for sub-par, overpriced, frozen meat sandwiches. One hour, $25 and a meat-inclusive meal I'll never get back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I must preface this review with a clear statement that I am an espresso fan.  I love great, dark espresso.  This coffee shop is a bit more than an hour from my house, and I drove here specifically to try out a new high-end coffee roaster in the area.  It's definitely not bad!  In fact, it's certainly better than average.  If there were 'half stars,' I would very comfortably rate it a 3.5.  But to me, a 4 star review would be something that I would drive an hour to visit again.  I'm sorry to say it, but unless I learned of an advancement in their roasting, I would not drive that far.  Stop by if I'm in the neighborhood?? ABSOLUTELY!  Decor is great.  Lots of coffee shop personality.    My breakfast sandwich was ok.  I had the egg, roasted pepper and Kennet mushroom sandwich.  It was very sweet, and I don't care for sweet sandwiches - but that's probably my own fault for ordering the peppers.    My espresso was incredibly light.  That is not my expectation for espresso, and I don't think that's my fault at all.  Most folks expect a very dark, robust drink when ordering espresso.  To the credit of the counter staff, I asked to buy their two darkest roasts, one pound each.  One of them said ""everything we roast is very light.""  ...yup!!  I sure do wish them luck, and I'm sure that tons of folks will adore the super-light roasts.  But for this coffee but, I'm more than a little sad it wasn't on par with La Colombe or Ultimo.  Hopefully they grow into that!!!  Addition: I don't read other reviews before writing mine.  After posting, I read a few others.  Service issues were a common theme for a few.  There are three young workers here on a Saturday morning.  They are totally just 'hanging out.'  Not a bad vibe if you are looking to attract college kids who don't really expect much in terms of quality service.  For a more high end place, they need better training and supervision.  A great manager or an owner looking over their shoulders would probably mean fewer dirty tables, a cleaner back counter area, and more of a ""we want to WOW you"" approach.  Definitely another area for improvement.  I think the problem is a disconnection from the look of the place and the running of it.  So much potential, short on results.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

I wouldn't come here for a date with my husband or bring family as there are other Italian restaurants in which the food is superior. However, this place is great if you need to make a reservation for a large group.   It is important to note that you order family style. Everything, from salads to pasta and entrees, are available in small or large. Small feeds two people, large feeds four. My husband and I can usually agree on a dish to share.  Our last visit, we ordered the spicy chicken rigatoni. It was OK. Not really spicy in either of our opinions, and the sauce was sparse. I did not really taste much garlic or crushed red pepper. We also split a caprese salad, which was good, but then again, it's hard to mess that one up!  Service was good for a large group.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Tonight we again visited this establishment.  We keep giving them a chance time and time again because we keep hearing and see them trying.  The food is good, I had the Mediterranean veggie burger ( which is what I have ever time I go here). The burger itself is good, I ask for it to be extra hot ( temperature) because being a veggie burger I know it is frozen.  This time it was warmer than last time, so I wold say it was better.  The service that is a whole different story.  First he young lady taking our order was a little overwhelmed.  Maybe she was new or the fact that is was a Thursday and there were many people there? Our order took over 20 minutes to arrive, then a basket of fries arrived, w e waited an additional 10 minutes, before we received the remaining of the order.  We were 7 people, so nothing too crazy ( at least we thought).  A member of our party ordered a beer, which was not delivered, so he had to go up and get it from the counter.  Not sure why it was not served at the time he ordered. The only reason I can ink of was the fact that the order taker may have been to young? At the end of the meal, the kids wanted shakes, we ordered 1 shake which took sometime, but no big deal.  Then 2 additional shakes were ordered, that took a LONG time.  Enough to make us go and cancel the order, we figured 10 minutes for 2 shakes that was a it too long.  As we were canceling the shakes they came out.  As we started to walk away the manager trainee ( Dave, I think that was his name) came out to the parking lot and gave us the money for the shakes and also gave us 2 orders of fries. He said "" he was the manager trainee and wanted us o be happy and return"". That was the only reason they got a 3 star rating.  I would suggest either better training for he staff or new staff. Maybe that is sit too harsh, but we were not the only table with order issues.

"I was once told my an employee of TD to NEVER eat here.  With that being said, I can disclose that I wish I could eat the mini hamburgers here everyday. For many unnamed reasons, I'm sure I should not - but they're just that good. Not to mention, they are the closest thing you will get to a Krystal burger unless you want to go to Bourbon Street and spend an obscene amount of money on a tiny burger that shouldn't be priced at more than 50 cents. (I'm not driving to Lafayette for Krystal burger, would you?)   Their desserts, while still good, have gone downhill over the years. You can purchase better desserts at Robert's, SAMs, Costco, or one of our amazing local bakeries if you feel like spending a little dough (pun-intended).  I used to love their doughnuts, and I haven't found any other doughnuts quite like theirs. You should know that they're the thick kind, though. There's nothing wrong with that; people just seem to prefer the right off the conveyer belt, lighter-tasting doughnuts these days.  The employees aren't the friendliest in town, but it's clear they don't have to be. This tastee has existed on this corner for as long as I can remember. My neighbors - past and present - have kept this place a staple in their lives. If you're around and need a quick, well-priced breakfast (not just donuts and pastries), give it a shot.

We have a lot of artisan ice cream shops in LA so I was happy to come upon one in Nashville as well.  The people behind the counter don't even cringe when you ask to sample 5 different flavors so go ahead and ask.  Here is my five cents.  Salted peanut butter tasted too salty. More peanut butter less salt please.  Goat milk with red cherries is a little tart but definitely a good flavor.  Brown butter almond brittle has a good crunch to it.  Brown butter ice cream was also well received although it didn't make the final cut.  I like that you can mix and match flavors in your cup or cone.  The cone is a $1 extra I believe but you do get a small piece of the cone in your cup and its delicious.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"This is the Boston Pizza location that I'm most likely to frequent. I've been visiting for well over a decade now and while the staff has been varied over the years, I've enjoyed visiting here at various times of day for various reasons. My most recent visit was during the early afternoon for Boston Pizza's 50th anniversary because of their $5 pizza promotion (which was indeed just $5! I did tip, of course as my service was great).  In the past I've visited in the late night after ballroom dance events, late morning for an early lunch and every time period in between on weekdays and weekends for gatherings with friends, alone or on a date. And while the food is the standard fare that all Boston Pizza locations have, this location is fairly consistent with service. I tend to get better service in the restaurant section (and I use this area more often) rather than in the lounge, but I've definitely visited both.  I like the fact that Boston Pizza is a good place to go and relax over a meal or drinks or snacks, or dessert for a few hours and not have to be terribly rushed, but where you can get in and out in an hour or less if need be. The patio is nice on a summer day as well.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"You can enjoy a wide variety of selections from Western foods to Asian foods.  They are pretty delicious. However, they have a system where you eat first and pay later. If you are a senior citizen or you are with a senior citizen, make sure you spell it out and tell them that. Otherwise, they will not give you a senior citizen discount even if it's obvious that you are a senior citizen or you are with a senior citizen. i found out later when I looked at my bill that they didn't give my mom  who is a senior citizen a discount, even though we mentioned it to them earlier, and even though they could see that my mom is in her 80s.  I find this a bit dishonest that they didn't subtract the discount from the billl. So, I called them about it and explained what  they did. They were aware and willing to give us the discount. That would just cause such inconvenience for my mom and all the parties involved were already home.  The point is that they should not do that because it's not good customer service.

This option was already in thought when we went, so we made a reservation and reserved a booth.  Reserve the booth if you haven't - it's a great view.  There's all of 3 of them.  Facing the all glassed in kitchen.  Very nice kitchen.  Clean, neat, watch your steak get grilled.  So my husband had the Cowboy ribeye.  WOW it's pricey.  Not his favorite cut because it's so fatty.  It was good, but he wouldn't do that steak again. Nice touch with the huge bone and his initials carved into it.  But he'd go with a strip steak next time.  My porterhouse was nice.  A little too much fat on the strip side for me. More leftovers for dinner 2 nights later....  It was good, but I wouldn't get it again for that price (everything is a la carte like a lot of steakhouses, but not all....)  My Mom got the pork chop milenesa.  Now.  This was FABULOUS.  I had some of it for leftovers 3 days later and OMG it was WONDERFUL and one of the less expensive entree choices on the menu.  Seriously spectacular.  We had a shrimp cocktail  It was 4 jumbo shrimp.  For $18.  Really?  They could have done 6 shrimp and at 3 bucks a piece would have still made a killer margin on them.  They were good, don't get me wrong, but not worth $18 for 4.  The cocktail sauce was awesome!  We had the lobster bisque.  I split it with my husband.  It was really good.  Top of the line.  One of the best, flavor-wise.  It was just a tiny bit loose.  Overall, very very good.  And we would get it again and split it!  We all 3 split one salad.  It was definitely enough.  We all split a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  They were good.  And we all split the tower of onion rings.  They were oily and don't reheat well (even broiled).  Overall, we'd go again but we wouldn't get those steaks and wouldn't make a special trip. Now that we have experienced quite a bit on the menu.

I've been to it's nuts on Route 29 Titusville and we always enjoyed eating there. However the Lambertville location was just a horrible experience. I called to order two dinners of fried chicken. I asked the woman on the phone how long it would be until the food would be ready she said to come now. When I arrived they told me that the french fries were not cooked and it would be a wait. I'm waiting for 10 minutes and they didn't even cook my fries yet. I told her I didn't want to wait anymore to just give me mashed potatoes instead. So she proceeded to hand me my food and it seems like it was a bit much. I ordered two dinners with two pieces of chicken each and she gave me 12 pieces of chicken. There were people standing around and obviously not caring about my order I had put in. I will never go back I think the service and the food is not good at all.

"Got in the mood for a meal on the beach, the sunset, and live music -- haven't been since pre-COVID, but figured this would be the perfect place this end of the beach. I wish they had clam strips like Frenchy's does, but I opted for their chicken wings and a side salad, my wife got the seared tuna. Both were AMAZING, yes even for something normal like wings. Live musician did great (some of the music they play during sets is too hard for this crowd and sunset), and our serve ""Mo"" was great -- very attentive and we didn't feel neglected even with such a large crowd. We waited for a table out on the porch so we'd have sunset views, but then as it was setting a small crowd from inside came out to stand and watch and blocked our view... that's on them though, rude tourists.

The chips and salsa were also very good, but the street corn was surprisingly delicious, we had the bowl so it would be easy to share. Now, to the main course, they were...just ok. My burrito, the East LA steak, was filling, yes, but it was missing some flavor. My wife also reported the tofu tacos had some flavor to be desired.

Chili's is my FAVORITE chain restaurant ever. I always have a great experience and the food and service are a reason why I am a repeat costumer.  This specific location does not live up to the standards. The bartender was on his phone the whole time and refused to check on his patrons to make sure they were doing good. It was really unprofessional and a really horrible representation of a company that has spent decades to obtain a reputation of being a great establishment. It was mostly awkward because you could tell everyone at the bar was getting really bad service. Very disappointing and will not be back at this location.   I'd like to add that due to Covid only half of the restaurant was full and there is no excuses for the lack of attention.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"It was a Sunday and I wanted to try somewhere new, so I checked my Excel spreadsheet (yes I have one) of places to try in the Tampa Bay area. Pane Rustica got great reviews and I've heard a lot about it, so off I went!  We came into the restaurant -- which, by the way, is WAY bigger than it looks on the outside -- and one of the employees gave us the rundown of what the ordering/seating process was like. You stand in line, check out the menu and then give your order to the cashier THEN you go find a seat. I don't think I have been to a place with this seating concept before, but maybe I have and I just can't remember.   Anyway.  I ordered the special burger of the day and asked for it rare with a warm center. My boyfriend, feeling far more adventurous than I, ordered the ""shut up and eat."" We snagged a small table and waited for our food.   My burger came out and it was overdone. Well done, actually. So unfortunately I had to send it back. Burgers are probably my favorite food so I want them cooked correctly. I was kind of mad that it came out so well done. Then I checked the receipt and the cashier put medium rare instead of rare, which was sort of irritating because that's not what I asked for.   Nobody came by to refill our water either, so I was pretty thirsty throughout the whole meal. So...service was really disappointing. I know they were busy, but I felt kind of ignored.  When my burger did come back out, it was pretty good. It had pepperjack cheese and some avocado aioli (not good, at all, no flavor whatsoever). It wasn't the best burger I've ever had, but the menu changes daily so I would probably go back to try another one.   My boyfriend's meal ended up being some kind of Asian shrimp pasta, which was very good, though small. There were only two pieces of shrimp, which is kind of weak for $14.   I did leave the restaurant still feeling a little hungry since all I got for a side was fruit and there were not that many pieces of fruit for the side. My boyfriend echoed the same sentiment.   The things that looked the best were the pizza and the other sandwiches. There was a chicken salad sandwich that I wanted to dive right into, but duh I wouldn't be rude and grab some random person's plate and start eating their food.   I will probably go back to try some of their other items, especially their flatbread pizza and the different burgers they offer. For a first visit, it was okay. Not anything wonderful, but I would be willing to give Pane Rustica another shot.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"the only reason i'm giving this three stars is because the bus boy named Terry was the most attentive person. Our waiter straight up didn't come to our table once so Terry took it upon himself to serve us himself. Honestly he deserves a promotion. He did everything our waiter didn't do. I kid you not we sat there for about 20 minutes before we realized the waiter wasn't coming so we asked Terry to help us and he ended up just taking our table. There were plenty of tables open and still people waiting in the back, and honestly the food was not worth the hassle. Willie maes was wayyyy better. I'm very disappointed.   OH ALSO a lady made a racist comment to my mom (who is full vietnamese). She asked her if she worked at the nail salon and when she told her she isn't from here the lady said ""oh you all look alike"". WTF i would literally never say something like that to ANYONE.

I was asked if I was taking the order to go or if I would be eating it in my car - I thought that was brilliant!  I told her I was eating it in the car on the way to a meeting. I was kinda confused when she handed me my taco though. It was unwrapped and in a paper ""basket"" ready for me to eat. Ya know .. it kind of made sense.

"Be aware to CHECK YOUR BILL before you pay.  When making reservation for 8 people or more, you are required to pay $10 per guest and this amount is immediately charged to your credit card. The restaurant is SUPPOSED to credit it back when you dine.  I was charged $80 immediately when I made the reservation for 8 people. When I was paying the bill while dining at the restaurant, I didn't check the bill for the credit of $80 reservation charge. The restaurant was supposed to credit it back on the bill. My bill was not credited and I didn't find that out until a couple days later. I had to call back the restaurant for my credit. The manager apologized and said ""someone"" should have asked me how I want this reservation charge credited back.  If I haven't checked my bill and phoned the restaurant back, I would have paid extra $80 and the restaurant would have made a profit of $80 from me!  Also, the restaurant automatically charges 18% tips for a large group and this is added to the total of your bill. When you pay via the machine, it still asks for another tip. The restaurant was packed and hence the services that day weren't great and our server wasn't attentive at our table.

"I'd give it 3.5 stars but there are no half stars as we all know. I'll leave that to someone generous who will round up their rating so the overall stars will average out. Anyways, I liked their bánh mì, ordered the regular one, although the meat were not much(one slice each of the pork roll (cha lua) and two different types of ham), I am satisfied that they used the egg yolk butter! That is always a plus in my book. The bánh mì has your typical veggies and pâté and the overall taste was good.  I also tried their broken rice dish, that was a Fail for them. I've always loved Vietnamese egg quiches and every place makes them a bit different here and there. But what is always a BIG FAT NO is when black pepper overpowers the entire piece of quiche! Yep, that is what happened here! I like black pepper in other dishes but seriously it does not belong on the quiche...so sad! The pork chop was average, not too dry.

"Three stars for mediocre effort, less than mediocre hot sauce, but a fair size portion of whiting.  I began this lunch trip by trying to order ahead on the app. Everything was fine until I paid and my card was charged. That's when I got a message that there was a problem with the order. (It was just a simple hot chicken sandwich, so what's the big deal?)  Since I was close to the restaurant, I decided to go inside to see what the issue was. Inside I found a large, clean open dining area with tables widely spaced. Not crowded, just 2 other customers. I stepped up to the cashier and asked about my Apple order. She said it did not go through because they do not have any chicken... They're out of chicken?. Uh???? I asked, ""what do you have"". She replied that they had fish. I said fine I'll take that. But just a sandwich. The cashier was polite but curt.   My order was prepared very quickly and I took it to my car rather than eating inside.  Needless to say it was disappointing. Two large pieces of fish, fried ok, lying on top of a piece of white bread, and some generic hot sauce sprinkled near it. Oh, and a couple of pickle chips next to a pile of raw onion. Simply not impressive for nine dollars -- although that said, the portion was decent (see photo).  Bottom line: no class, no character or ambience, no style, no flavor - other than fried. Three stars is probably generous, but today they'll get the benefit of the doubt.   So,  it's called Helen's Hot Chicken but sometimes they only have fish. Timing is everything I guess.

"Just walked out at 1:40pm today (Friday, Dec 20).  That's an odd hour and there were only a couple of tables of people finishing up lunch.  Unfortunately, the man in front of me placed a carryout order.  The hostess took his order, then seated me, then went to the kitchen.  In the next 10 minutes, nobody ever came out of the kitchen.  Nobody spoke to me.  In fact, nobody saw me leave.    Near as I can tell, the cook and the hostess in the kitchen were the only staff.   I like to eat in family-owned restaurants and was interested to try this one, but the risk is that nobody is actually running the place. That's what happened today.

The wait staff and managers are very attentive, or waitress was really friendly and prompt (hardly had to ask for help). 3. The appetizers were really good. We had the empanadas (EXCELLENT), and their Spicey shrimp was actually better than Bone Fishes Bang bang shrimp. 4. The food needs some help. We ordered the Paella, Taste of Jamaica and the Fish tacos. The paella wasn't very tasty rather bland actually. The Taste of Jamaica I will not order again to pricey for the quality. My wife complained that the tomatoes in the Fish tacos tasted tinny as if they were canned and not fresh. 5. The bussers who brought the food still didn't know the table numbers so they stood with the food trying to figure out where to take it.

Last night I ordered a combo, which included pork and seeds. Most things were ok, but the pork was so dry and gross it had to have been sitting uncovered for days. They didn't send any mustard, they didn't send any seeds, they didn't send any ketchup, and they were pretty rude on the phone. I couldn't understand the last thing they said to me so I asked them to repeat it and they just hung up. It was Pretty rude and made me feel like a bother as a customer.

"Craving pizza on a Sunday night and discovered this inviting restaurant.  There is outside seating and lots of inside seating with TVs everywhere.     The host took our drink orders since our server was busy and since we had been drinking all day at the Savor Fest, we opted for Coke.  They arrived and were so sweet, we presumed they hadn't done the carbonation mix correctly.   When our server arrived we told him and he said it wasn't Coke, but cola and he always tells his customers when they order it because it's different.   We switched to iced tea, which turns out to have a very strong tea flavor.    The menu is what I expected from a place like this and we settled on cheesesteak egg rolls and a pizza with sausage and peppers.       The 3 egg rolls (who gets the 3rd one LOL) arrived quickly and were extremely good.   Juicy, tender meat in an egg roll served with a melted cheese.  Yum!  We ate then so quickly I forgot to take pictures.   Then.......we........waited.....and waited.    After about 35 minutes our server came and asked if we wanted dessert.    Told him we hadn't even gotten our pizza yet.   He knew that and was apologetic and wanted to get us free dessert.   We weren't in the mood and then finally 5 minutes later our pizza arrived.    The pizza was good and hot and the crust was so light it was easy to eat it all and not leave the ends.    We can't decide if it was the sauce or the sausage that was spicy, but I think it was the sauce.   I liked it.  They really deserve 3 stars for this trip, but since the food was so good, I gave them 4 because I know it was a screw up in the kitchen.    In the end, they made it right and gave us the egg rolls for free.    I wish they had different size pizzas.

The food was moderately priced compared to similar Chinatown restaurant but it definitely speaks to the quality.

"I've been to other Rock Bottoms. This one has some issues. They forgot to put the side in a simple carry-out order. When we went in person a couple days later, it was about half full.  There were 4 employees hanging around the hostess stand, I could not tell what they were doing. The main hostess tells us an empty table near the front won't be clean for 10 minutes. Our party, and the 4 employees at the hostess stand, wait for 10 minutes, and someone from the back finally cleans the table and lets us sit, at our wet sticky table. Other dirty tables sat there unattended during our meal. For a brewery restaurant, you would think they would have at least one Porter or Stout, right? Darkest beer was a brown ale. They did have a $14.99 glass of basic chardonnay, I think the full bottle is $8.99 at the CVS.  The waitresses were good, although they have no beer knowledge.  Overall, the food is decent. They are very light on the actual meat part of your fajita or chicken sandwich, but the burgers are better sized.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Really mixed bag here, on one hand the food can be really good and the customer service is normally great, on the other hand theres ONE specific employee there that seems to hate being a server, she'll argue with you about the menu options (even if its available) shell put in your order wrong, shell roll her eyes at you, she'll sit and text.  Ive been a server before, but she actually made me feel hated and i haven't felt that way by a server in YEARS I had been coming here 2 times every week for like 2 months but after having her as my server i really dont feel welcome any more and wont be coming back  Great place for cheap mexican food if you can stomach potentially being HATED by your server",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"My niece and I stopped in after a long day on the river..  I read all of the reviews and expected the place to be very good.. Have to say we were both disappointed.  Even though there were only 2 other tables, it took over 5 minutes for them to come to our table. We ordered the Dragon roll, chicken stone bowl and crab rangoons.  The dragon roll was just ""ok"" and pretty small. The stone bowl was terrible because you could not even chew the chicken.  It was literally like rubber. We sent it back and ordered a bowl of fried rice so my niece could have something before heading on home.  They refused to take the stone bowl off of our bill even though she did not eat it. And still charged $3.99 for the bowl of rice we had to order to replace it.  Not really what I consider good customer service.  I also ordered spring rolls because i was still hungry from the small shushi roll.  So, its not like we were just trying to get something for free, I mean, we ordered several items.  I rarely complain in a restaurant but had to say something,  as this was the worst chciken I have ever tried to eat.  Seems like it could be a good place but our experince was lackng, a lot..

The food, oysters included, is good, but standards are considerably lower than the Metairie location.  The Metairie restaurant gets 4-5 stars, better at night.

"Yes, I gave this place 5 stars.  Well deserved.  I have to be honest and say I went in not expected much.  The place is deceivingly large so they can easily accommodate larger parties. We had a party of 5 and with our reservation were sat immediately, drink order taken immediately and were great with their wonderful never ending supply of chips and salsa. You can easily eat healthy on their menu.  They have a great flavorful Kale salad which I added salmon to and ended up bringing some home.  However, I highly suggest trying the apps as we got Ropa Vieja and I fully intend on going back and making this my meal.  My husband got the taco dinner with 3 different tacos and it was amazing.  Everyone at our table was completely satisfied.  The manager stopped by to check on things which was refreshing especially since it seems the service industry in Nashville is lacking in certain restaurants.

"So....For some reason my husband and I opted to eat here last night.  We hadn't been to a LJS in years.  For starters, there was some sort of power tool noise happening behind the line.  Because of this, it took a little bit longer than it should have for someone to realize we were there.  Once there, the young gentleman was friendly and took our order.  We ordered the family meal to split as both of us were pretty hungry.  Our order came out hot and fresh.  We ended up with a TON of onion rings.  Man oh man.  There were enough onion rings to feed a small army.  Our fish and chicken were the typical Long John's fare.  We took our cole slaw with us as we couldn't finish our meal.  Everything was super greasy.  That is to be expected here though.  It was okay.  The sound of the power tool continued during the entire time we ate there.  It was really loud and annoying.  The young people behind the counter also apparently became bored and started to horse around.  They could have used their time more wisely and cleaned up the filthy lobby.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Went here on a Friday night, 8:30 reservation for 3. The restaurant design and atmosphere is basically the only positive thing to say about CO-OP. The bathrooms, huge lounge area in the next room, and seating area are all really nice looking.  Unfortunately the service was terrible. It took about 20 minutes to get our first drink and they did not have the Kombucha cocktail (though they still charged us for it on the bill). After sitting around for about a half hour the waiter (who was probably new) took our order. We got the Brussels sprouts and the calamari for apps. The ""Crispy"" Brussels were not cooked and nearly raw, the sauce was decent. The calamari isn't anything special.  For entrees the 3 of us got the Wild Striped Bass, Scallops, and Cauliflower Dukkah. The Cauliflower was definitely the best of the 3, it was hot (comes in a cast iron dish) and tasty enough, though again a bit undercooked. The Bass that I had came out barely warm - it comes on a bed of wild rice and ""roasted seasonal vegetables"". The vegetables were literally raw - the carrots and I believe parsnips were barely cooked, and the broccoli was more cooked but not very good. Very disappointing, and raw parsnips left a bitter taste in your mouth. The bass itself was ok, it had crispy skin but again it wasn't warm enough so it wasn't very appetizing to eat. The scallops came out cold, on a bed of spaghetti squash something or other, and the whole dish was cold. My girlfriend is much more vocal than I and she complained and they sent it back to be ""warmed up"" not remade...so yeah it came out again like 3 minutes later and it was lukewarm. She ate it basically because we wanted to get out of there.  When the bill came it was over $200 and like I said they charged us for the kombucha drinks which we didn't get, so we took the bill to a manager. Really the only other positive thing was the way they handled it. They reduced our bill by about 50%, took off those drinks we didn't get and brought us out a slice of cheesecake and chocolate cake, which unfortunately weren't good, but it was a nice gesture. Thanks to the manager for trying to make things right. Won't be going back for food but may go back to check out the lounge some other time.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"Carrabbas is my favorite Italian restaurant! The food is delicious and the service is always great. Very little restaurants compare to this one in my eyes. The calamari is the best I've had. If you like sangria, their blackberry sangria is very refreshing and delicious. If you happen to be in Brandon, make sure to ask for Ed at the bar.

"Rating is not for food but for customer service. I've ordered carryout twice now and don't get me wrong, the food is great, but when I had an issue with the company they use for their delivery service(Doordash) dropping the food off outside of my work at a hospital on a parking lot bench and not calling to tell me that resulting in the food sitting outside for 40 minutes....I contacted the restaurant as instructed to on the online order confirmation page, completely baffled that somebody would think that delivery was okay... The women I talked to, who I presume was the manager/owner was more concerned about having to make the food again and losing money for remaking one order for her company rather than catering to the customer that already paid for it as she said that exact thing to me twice on the phone... that she would be losing money, as if I wasn't in the same boat at that point?! Doesn't seem like the best way to support your customers...who are trying to support local. I was instructed by her to call Doordash to sort it out, which seems like something she should have done, given it's the company they trust to deliver their food and the driver was claimed to be one of their most frequent drivers. I ultimately got my food roughly 3.5 hrs after ordering it and although the food was delicious, the lack of customer service and concern around the whole issue left a bad taste in my mouth.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Not our first time, but my boyfriend and I stopped in here on a Football Sunday (in between games).  It's like the cook in the kitchen was taking the day off.  It wasn't a team effort, but our waiter was doing well.  It was all downhill from there.  The problem was the cuts of meat on the burnt ends (appetizer and entree portions) were nothing else but cuts of fat.  The meat was chewy and very much NOT worth the price.  It was like City BBQ on their bad day - only much worse.  Only 3 out of the group of pieces were good. For two people, we paid $43 and some change.  We always order water - we aren't ever charged for sugary beverages.  So, that price was just for bad food.  Everything else was somewhat edible.  The brisket was a little more dry than normal so I used the BBQ sauce to enhance the flavors, however, I feel like there wasn't much good in it to make this a memorable meal.  It lacked finesse, taste, and tenderness.    We won't be back, so continue with your lazy cuttings of meat.  It was the worst meal we ever had.  We should have gone to Weber Grill.  It was an insult to culinary creations in the kitchen.  Gordon Ramsay would have thrown a fit.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Thank goodness the food was pretty good because I've never been treated so rudely by staff - not just the person at the counter but then when I seemed a little stunned by the treatment I was getting by the person taking my order, but also one of the line cooks chimed in. The situation was I was having trouble figuring out which one to choose - it was my first time and I was starved - BUT - I was dying to use the restroom which seemed to be a really BIG ISSUE because I hadn't yet placed my order and they have a policy of customers only for use of the facilities. Now I can understand this, but I had been there a good 5 minutes contemplating the menu and said it was my first time and there were so many choices which looked interesting. When the line cook chimed in that it was the store policy I was stunned - so I pulled out a $10 bill out of my wallet, handed it to the cashier, proceeded to use the restroom and returned to complete placement of my order. Frankly I didn't want to rush my selection - and yes, I really had to go. Anway - long story short is thank goodness the food was good - I have to give them that - but it still has left a bad impression on me - and to think I had been looking forward to trying out this place. I could see one associate being in a bad mood - I've had my share of bad days too - but to have 2 associates giving me a hard time leads me to think it's from the top down. Management should take responsibility for this and really work to train the staff on how to create a welcoming environment for the patrons. It may not be a top dollar expensive restaurant but it's also not cheap either - and I was contemplating trying the most expensive dish on the menu (Lobster mac-n-cheese $11) but I was so put off by the service I chose something safer and less expensive.

"Went here on a suggestion from my friend.   Major pluses for LOTS OF FRESH. They have topping options that you just can't find around here. Like garlic. Minced garlic, roasted garlic, or garlic sauce-stuff (don't remember what it was exactly). Spinach. Roma tomatoes or sun-dried. Whatever. Thank you, Reginelli's, because I need some fresh on my pizza.  They also can do half and halfs. We shared the Mediterranean, I think, with spinach and a whole bunch of other stuff, including roasted garlic. No olives, add pineapple on my side. My pizza ""trinity"" is spinach, pineapple and garlic, so yay. And we got a side of hummus because my roomie's a hummus aficionado.   Mehs:  The hummus was suspect because it had a subtle tang like anchovies or something. Since I'm allergic to types of fish, I have to be careful, but I didn't ask and I still ate it. I didn't end up having a reaction, I don't think, so if there was some kind of paste in there, it was slight. Ask.  Also, the service was only ok. It was ok, but only ok. They seemed overstaffed for the 1-3 parties that were there at a given time, kinda standing around. Drink got filled, but it was just weird. I was confused when I walked in why we were the only customers and the restaurants down the block had filled their sidewalk seating.   They have some beer, the usuals, and wine. But I looked at the wine selection and I was NOT impressed. I wasn't there to drink, but now that I'm informed I would never go there to drink.   Besides, the atmosphere just not right for drinking.

This is the absolute worst McDonald's in the history of McDonald's there is no rhyme or reason to how they take orders in the 2 lane drive thru-sit back and enjoy your 30 minute wait as at least 3 cars that arrived after you get there orders taken before you. Once you've finally made your way to the first window you'll hand your money to someone wearing their mask under there nose. But we're not through yet-you still have to traverse the final window where you're guaranteed to be shorted at least one burger if you don't double check the bag. And when you do tell them they shorted you also be prepared to hand the bag back to them so they can rifle through it and knock all the fries to the bottom of the bag.

"I would say you really have to be careful when coming to this place to eat inside. It was my 1st time and lots and lots of flies. I'm not kidding, just didn't feel comfortable at all dining inside. Hopefully they take care of this pestilence, the cashier who is a male doesn't bother to ask people if it's our first time. We did not know what to expect and with the hunger we carried we ordered 2 sides (potatoes) (chips & Guacamole), 2 of their big burritos, one order of 6 tacos, and one more order of their Guadalajara tacos, along with 3 drinks. One Jarrito, one Horchata water, & Hibiscus water.  All of these for $ 89.69. We actually didn't think it was worth it but it was our 1st time. Personally husband and I just didn't feel like their Chorizo meat is good. But what disappointed my husband is the lack of communication to us the clients on informing us how much onions they load all the food. Just tons and tons of Purple onions. Be careful if ur not interested in eating a colossal amount of purple onions. Tortillas were not our cup of tea. Street tacos were ok. But the rest of the food we order wasn't what we expected. Not bad if ur ordering to go just street tacos but they didn't even put enough rice on our burritos and only a couple of black beans. We were expecting pinto beans.

I think their food is very good to excellent and they follow the new trend of having a Chinese menu with many Szechuan items which are much more authentic.

"A lot of mixed feelings about this place. Let me start by saying though, the vibe and decor of the restaurant is great. Love the style and open layout concept.  Looking at the menu, everything sounded amazing. Photos made the food look incredible and the reviews were great. I had high expectations after researching a little bit.  The angel biscuits were INCREDIBLE. The best thing on the menu. Something about dipping it in all the ingredients that pair perfectly together in your mouth is something else. It truly was delicious.  For our entrees, two of us got the braised short rib meatloaf and my sister got the chicken under a brick. We ordered mac and cheese for the table. The short rib was pretty good in my opinion, especially paired with the mashed potatoes and broccolini. I would order that again. My other sister said hers was a bit dry and didn't like it as much as I did.  Where they went wrong is the chicken under a brick and mac and cheese. I was confused when I tried these because everything else had been pretty good up to this point. The chicken under a brick was not great and I don't recommend getting it. There was a lack of flavor and the ingredients together just didn't do it for us. My sister didn't eat more than a couple bites. The mac and cheese also lacked a lot of flavor and tasted pretty bland.  The only term I can think of for describing the food is inconsistent. Some things are incredible and others fell flat. However, I won't let that detour me from coming to try other things. I just won't be trying those two things again. Another point to add is it is a bit overpriced.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"This is a great choice when in town with a large group!

While we had to wait both times even with reservations, there is an awesome bar within the hotel called Sazerac to hang out in.  You must, and I mean must, order the cauliflower appetizer here - it will change anyone's mind who doesn't believe that cauliflower is delicious!  All of the pizzas are great too!

"The biggest problem here is the food. I ordered a simple tuna melt, food came and the tuna was cold and about one piece of cheese on the sandwich, which wasn't even melted. I thought a tuna melt was a hot sandwich! The other thing I didn't care for was the waitress was complaining the whole time to her co-workers and also other guests dining(they seemed like regulars), about a tip that she just received and how small it was, she went on and on, suck it up babe, take what they leave you! And lastly, when it was time for us the order ice cream, instead of giving us a dessert menu, she just asked us what we wanted.  Now I have been to Friendly's before but years ago, so I had to jog my memory about what they had. The ice cream portions and toppings seem to be about cut in half of what it used to be 10 years ago, but I think that is with all Friendly's.

I only go back because it's the only one near me and I'd have to drive another 15-20 minutes to go to another one. They need new employees, managers or headsets...something because they literally cannot comprehend an order. Take the extra time and drive to Brentwood if you can.

"We had an 8PM reservation on a Saturday night, the parking lot was almost totally full, and the lobby was packed, the bar and bar area the same.  But we were taken right to our table, much to my surprise.  I was expecting a wait, there wasn't any, but then again maybe they knew I was a YELPER.  LOL  Starting with a wonderfully full to the brim Hendricks martini and my friend with a specialty prickly pear martini, and an excellent waiter, we were off to an experience to remember.  What a wonderful dinner menu, easy to choose, I wanted everything.  We started with the pear salad and the tuna tartare.  The salad fresh, superb, perfect dressed.  The tuna had a real nice spicy kick, the tuna was totally vein free and was exquisitely presented and subsequently devoured.  The scallops were extremely fresh, perfectly cooked and accompanied with a wonderful curried cauliflower and an extremely tasty parsnip puree.  The cod was light, flaky, moist, and topped with a shallot/thyme crust.  This dish was perfect in every way.  The whole night was a success, including the eclectic lively crowd, and the beautifully decorated dining rooms, service (he was also a great help with the wine choices), everything.

No one in drive through would answer so I park and go in and they don't have their meatballs ready so they say I have to wait 10 minutes. Then she says the other person didn't have her headset on and that's why she didn't answer the drive through. No apology. Like them not having their act together on time is not unusual for them. No Big deal in their eyes. I never give such a poor reviews but Oldsmar Subway is the worst customer service. They suck. Not just once. You know someone could have an off day, I get it.

One day the food is just as I remember it and the next I wonder what happened to the food.

"I am at the mall M-F as I use public transportation to go to work. I decided to try Wayback Burgers. I ordered the classic which is double burger and cheese. You basically build your own so I added lettuce, tomato, American cheese, pickles, mushrooms, and added extra blue cheese spread. You are not charged extra for items which is great! I wasn't hungry enough to try deep fried mac n cheese although am curious about. I will say it was pretty darn good. The buns are awesome, wonder where they get those from? I think I would have enjoyed my burger better with mayo and mustard as the blue cheese spread is an upscale dressing. It was tasty but a little messy and not a normal crumbled blue cheese. I viewed the menu and they have a number of options... Chicken, cod and sourdough sandwiches. I will go back. I will say plan to spend 7 bucks atleast for a burger. Remember all the fixings are free that's definitely a plus. I also want to add the the customer service was exceptional, that's another reason why I will be back, plus damn I need to try those Mac n cheese bites.

I had never been served that type of complimentary snack before, so that was a cool touch to our dinner. Also, while we waited I ordered a rum punch cocktail. It was $8 and it tasted amazing. My friend and I loved it. The cocktail was sweet and strong. When our seafood platter arrived, we were astounded at how big it was since we only ordered the ""half"" platter. I liked that Deanies serves large portion sizes. The only caveat with my experience here was that the fried catfish in the seafood platter had somewhat of a strange aftertaste.

"When it comes to steak, I'm not easy to please. I'm probably one of the snobbiest carnivores around, so when I say that I'm blown away by a piece of beef, you know it's damn good. Well hats off to the Butcher & Singer chefs for literally serving me the best steak I've had in recent memory.   Started the meal with a blue-cheese stuffed olive martini - fantastic way to whet the palette - and noshed on some Oysters Rockefeller before splitting their Tomato & Onion and Butcher Salads. The former featured deliciously ripe tomatoes smothered in Roquefort Bleu Cheese and the most thinly sliced Vidalia onions; while the latter was a deliciously light chopped salad containing crisp lettuce, chickpeas, green beans, some sopressata salami, and various other ingredients that, although intimidatingly filling sounding at first, was a really light intro. The dressing was somewhat sweet, but not in an overwhelming way.   Then came the steak. We shared the 20oz. Porterhouse for two, priced reasonably at $74. It. Was. Awesome. Prepared perfectly medium-rare with a charred outer edge that was so flavorful, I literally stopped mid bite to pinch myself. No, I wasn't dreaming. Yes, it was real steak and yeah, it was THAT good. And the brussel sprout side? They are literally the tastiest green side i've ever had - they are almost deconstructed and served sauteed w/ applewood smoked bacon. The server actually said, ""I want to let you know that the brussel sprouts come with bacon, is that okay?"" I almost ordered a second serving when I heard that...   The decor of this steak house is also really enjoyable. It's in a massive space with high ceilings and though the lighting is pretty dim, it's not too dark like most steakhouses. There's a warmth about the place that makes eating here really comfortable. It also reminds me of one of those big band/swing joints you see in movies. I expected to see a live swing trio standing in individual booths there.  I think it's safe to say that this place may have just knocked Del Frisco's out of first place in my list of ""best steakhouses ever.""

I do feel the tacos we had would only be the same with dine in and you wouldn't get the same experience with a take out, but you never know! The meat was all tender and melted in your mouth. The flavours were punchy and the sauces excellently paired.  The staff were super friendly and made us feel good even though the space was small. Due to covid they have plastic shields up between all the tables which was a great way to keep everyone safe and still allow people to dine in and eat.  I love having chips and guacamole as a starter but it was an extra item we had to order, which is too bad I feel like they might even offer that as an included starter would have been cool. It did come with a hot sauce that was super well liked.  The snapper fish tacos were the best, they did only come with 3 tacos instead of 4 and you wouldn't know this unless someone told you. But they were super crispy and had great complimenting toppings.  We also ordered a beef, vegetarian mushroom, and pulled pork tacos which were all super tasty!

"This place is literally a diamond in the rough. The surrounding buildings and homes are not the greatest. The parking lot is too small. The outside patio seems pretty relaxing. The food was very good but not as good as the prices would suggest. Same with the service. Our waiter was nice, but average and on the slow side.  NOT good for kids.... definitely not kids under 7. But even with an older kid but not a teenager....no kids menu. I couldn't believe it. The waiter said they can do 1/2 portions. But kids chicken parm $34 is insane. I think it was really full sized but no child needs that size meal.  The waiter just put in on the bill and assumed I wouldn't notice I guess.   Crab cakes are huge but they came with a white sauce drizzled over them which I didn't love the look of it!  Also I found 3 or 4 shells in each crab cake which is an automatic turn off for me but especially for $59. That's unacceptable. Lobster was great, cooked perfectly. My friend thought the filet mignon was amazing, very tender but again very pricey. Creme brûlée was very good but $9.   It's really like Philadelphia prices in Salem Co.

"A group of six friends including myself made the 3 hr day trip to St. Louis to check out the City Museum and then catch a concert that evening. We were looking for a place with American food at reasonable prices that was comfortable... Especially given that there temps were in the upper 90s that day. When choosing the place to eat, we wanted to remain somewhat near the City Museum and wanted a mom and pop shop. From the little research we could quickly do for being out of town, the description of this place SEEMED to fit the bill. We seen moderate priced and American food and thought we would give it a try.

Because we were from out of town, it was an extremely hot day, and we planned on doing a lot of walking, we were dressed in normal jeans, t-shirts, shorts, and hats. Summer attire. When we walked in we IMMEDIATELY knew we were in the wrong place because it appeared very very upscale... More so than our research had hinted at. Despite how small it was inside, we noticed several empty tables. We noticed those that were in there all were wearing suits and ties and seemed very upscale. We figured well it's downtown, it's probably just business people eating a quick lunch. Once members of the staff noticed us we realized just how snobby this place was.  They gave us the looks as if we did not belong at all. We were ""greeted"" and told there was no space for us inside (Um, they only had 3 tables in use out of several empty ones still left!) or we could sit at the bar. This left all of us with the sense that they did not what us to be seen inside their establishment because we weren't ""good enough"". They sat us at the ""bar"" (since we refused to sit outside in 98 degree heat and humidity). We opened the menu and realized how small it was. Then we noticed that there wasn't much ""American"" about the menu at all. It was all very, upscale, snobbery type food.... Then the prices... $15 for a bowl of ramen?? Was that a joke? $6 for a side of French fries? RIDICULOUS prices. We looked around us a bit at the plates of food others were eating and noticed the portions were not proportionate with the prices on the menu at all.  We all agreed this was not the place for us, we very very politely told our waitress that we needed to go elsewhere due to dietary needs. We didn't want to be rude, so we apologized several times. The staff indoors seemed very relieved they would not have to serve us. Once we walked back outside there was a man working on putting together more tables. We asked him for suggestions and asked him if the food at the ""Flying Saucer"" was any good. His response, in a very very snobby manner was ""Well you guys won't eat here and this is the best food in downtown so I don't know what to tell you"". Excuse me? We are from out of town. It shouldn't matter if we are eating at your establishment or not, we are human beings and he should have been a bit more helpful and understanding that than. We asked him for directions to the Flying Saucer and he told is it was way far away ""down that way somewhere"". Gee thanks I thought. But being the friendly Midwesterners we are we thanked him and headed in that direction. What we found was that the Flying Saucer was neither that far away at all, or in the direction he sent us. We did however find ""American"" food there at reasonable prices, comfortable atmosphere, and a extreme let appreciative, attentive, and friendly staff.   My suggestions - if you are from out of town DO NOT GO HERE. If you want American food, DO NOT GO HERE. If you do not own at least own or two platinum cards, DO NOT GO HERE. If your a snobby person and enjoy ""experimental, NON AMERICAN food, you might do well here, otherwise stay away.   My suggestions to the owners - change your descriptions to Bette reflect what type of establishment you have if you don't want others from out of town just waltzing in as I gather you don't from our experience. Don't kid yourselves. You are NOT moderately priced, you DO NOT have American food, and you ARE NOT friendly, comfortable and welcoming.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"ALERT!!!!! THEE most disgusting food I've ever had in my life!!!!   I ordered from them because they were the only Chinese restaurant that delivered to my hotel, I had the combination fried rice and shrimp egg rolls. The fried rice wasn't fried at all, and it looked a lot like Uncle Ben's rice that you get from the grocery store. The egg rolls were barely fried as well. The meat wasn't cooked thoroughly, if it was real chicken and beef at all. And the food had a weird smell to it. I wouldn't recommend anyone eating at this establishment in the future, in fact they need to fucking shut this place down.

"For the price (I think my buffalo burger was 12 or 13 dollars) I expected a lot better. Meat was very thin/small and had very, very little flavor.

"We have been to this Outback many times.  We have noticed prices rising and quality and serving sizes going down.  Tonight we splurged on fillet and lobster.  I ordered as always med rare.  The meal arrived with a very small potato and a very small fillet.  When I cut into it it appeared raw in the center.  I tried one bite and could not eat it.  When the waiter returned I showed him my steak and he said, ""oh no, I will take it back and we will cook it a ""couple more minutes"".  The acting, assistant whatever manager brought back my steak, the small pieces I had already cut were charred and overdone.  The other half was very charred on the outside and still raw in the center.  All the while the manager person was beaming as if they had created a marvel.  My regret was not taking a picture of this mess.  I could not understand how a manager could serve this.  When I expressed my displeasure he pops out a card for a free appetizer for next time as if that will make up for a $26 mess.  I indicated I could not eat that and there was a half hearted offer to take it back again.  I declined since this steak was already inedible.  Needless to say we will not be back again.  Although the waiter was very nice, I think he should have gone back to the pseudo manager and said, ""she cannot eat that steak"".  Did not happen.  I happen to have a lot of family stuff going on and this was the very last thing I needed tonight.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Racist """"security guards"""". Why you got security at a restaurant anyways. Floor manager wasn't helpful, was a bit of a d-bag when we addressed our concerns. Clearly overcompensating for something.. Wish I got their names. Food was pretty good, however their attitudes were greatly distasteful and ruined a special occasion.

"Some things are simply not as good as your remember . . . hence is the case of returning to Charlie Brown's for the first time in perhaps 10 years.    Still beautiful inside plus the nice historic aspect but the food wasn't as good.    Props for the Yelp check in offer - the chipotle shrimp app was sooo good.  So much so that my daughter asked if she thought we could find the recipe online!    The salad bar was still as good as ever.  They still have the yummy liver pate too :)     Our waitress was a bit ""squirrley"".  I mentioned how long it had been since I'd last been to CB's.  No reaction.  My daughter was like ""she doesn't care mom!""   I asked her to take a picture of us.  She drudgingly did so.  She must have really wanted to choke me when I asked for a re-take b/c I didn't like how I looked! haha!   Onto the entrees.  My daughter ordered medium-rare sirloin and a baked potato.  The steak was in two long pieces????  It was pretty good but no Outback (or Bonefish)  - sorry CB's!    My son got a cheeseburger and liked it but he's 13 so who knows.  I didn't try it.  We brought the burnt pieces home to our spoiled dog.  I had the crab stuffed flounder.  It was decent, but I prefer how they served it much better years ago.    My steamed broccoli was actually good.  I ordered it just to stay w/in my low carb dinners and was pleasantly surprised.    The desserts were BANGIN' good.  I didn't order one but the kiddos did.  Alex's skillet cookie sundae was DELICIOUS, as was my son's cheesecake.  He didn't like it b/c it wasn't the type (creamier) that he's used to.  It truly WAS good though.  I'm super picky about cheesecake.    Our waitress was MIA and I needed to leave to make a meeting.  I got the hostess and she hooked me up and got us out in a quick manner, which was highly appreciated!   I'm in no hurry to return here.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We went to Heist on a Saturday before noon.  I had the living social deal because, well, I just like a deal.  I was nervous because of the mixed reviews but we thought it was very good.  Service was a little slow but I am generally not in much of a hurry so I didn't mind.  We ordered the antipasto and the traditional pepperoni.  The antipasto could have had more toppings but was very good and a large portion.  The pizzas are far from a single serving.  It was pretty heavy on the cheese which my husband likes.  I just ate 2 pieces cold for my lunch.  Yummy.  I will go again, even without a deal.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"I'm going to be perfectly honest: I did not enjoy my meal here. However, the service was attentive and Zack devoured his pulled pork sandwich- I have no doubts that other people will love this place.   The pulled jerk chicken sandwich didn't taste like jerk chicken. It was mushy and unappetizing and served on a long roll. Looked kinda like stuffing at a Thanksgiving table spread and I could only eat a few bites. The ""coleslaw"" was really just pickled cabbage and the fries are sprinkled with bay seasoning. Maybe you're into that. I'm just letting you know, okay?   FYI: the only side offered that doesn't include a pork product is the mac and cheese.   Zack's going to reheat the other 3/4 of my sandwich for lunch tomorrow. He'll probably like it better than I did.  Note- @BlueBellyBBQ did not like this review. They tweeted this about me (later deleted from their account). Thanks guys. http://tinypic.com/r/jrwdj7/6  Zack's going to have to go without lunch tomorrow.

"I used to go to this restaurant quite often before Covid. We just went back for the first time in a year and a half and I have to say I will never go back. When I walked into the restaurant the smell of mold or mildew hit me...my friend remarked that it smelled like a latrine. I ordered arugula with olive oil with a grilled chicken breast, something I often used to order here. When it arrived the arugula was old, soggy and brown in spots with no olive oil on it,  and the chicken literally looked like it had been chewed up and spit out... and was hard, dry and rubbery. I gave it back to the server and told her I was sorry but it was inedible. When I used the ladies room, the faucets were both broken, about to fall off. I have the feeling that this place has just gone to pot. So sad because it was my go-to place in Media for many years.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"I have ordered take out twice and can easily say it wouldn't be on my list of places to order from again. The food in general was disappointing.   The bun from my sandwich was soggy, the meat was tough and dry, and the coleslaw dressing covered up any BBQ flavour from the meat. The ""tempura battered"" onion rings tasted like the same cheap frozen crap I might get at a small town hockey rink canteen. Definitely not a good thing.  We ordered the mac'n'cheese rolls which essentially were white pasta in an egg role with no cheese whatsoever. They had no flavour at all. They came with a sauce that wasn't very good which I assume was meant to be the ""cheese"" but ultimately failed to bring any resemblance of mac'n'cheese flavouring to the dish.   Oh well, live and learn... There are a few other BBQ joints I know I can count on when I need it.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"2.5 stars at best (and yelp reeeeeally needs to start doing half stars on rating scale).  glad it was open till late on Easter Sunday, so we didn't feel like we were keeping people from going home, entering close to 8pm as group of 6.  that said, it was downhill from there.  issues: - sat outside on the patio, which is cool, except the chairs -- while great for lounging -- are too low and reclined for eating at the table. and there was no seat cushion to bump it up.  - i ordered a ginger basil mango mojito. there was no ginger, no basil, no mango, nor mojito. got some sugar syrup on ice with a slice of orange and mint leaf instead. didn't realize it was completely different than what i ordered - and absolutely gross - until half point; didn't want to send it back as if i was looking for a handout. not sure what i was charged for that either. - ordered ""plain"" wings from kids menu, came out looking and tasting like buffalo wings, a bit spicy for little kids. inquired with waiter and was told this was ""plain"" indeed; not sure what ""hot"" would be, then. he was great to quickly offer to switch. we kept the first one for us. - ordered shared appetizer (lobster queso dip), with no plates to use. settings came after orders were put in. strange but ok. - poor kid also didn't get a setting. ate mac and cheese with hands, and no napkin. over-prepared mom came through. - restaurant didn't seem THAT busy (8:30pm on a Sunday night), yet we had to wait nearly - if not over - 30 min for entreés to show. what we ordered, you ask? steak (quickest to cook), prime rib (already done), ribs (already done)...yeah i can't think of a reason why, either. - food's cooked right and tasted mostly ok, but for ~$25 per plate, i'm disappointed overall. would be a solid 3-star if price point is at 20% less. - menu choices weren't that exciting either: prime rib, steak, steak, steak, salmon, chicken, meatloaf, burger. zzzz...   a total bleh.  the server was very friendly and polite. only saving grace. oh, and they offer gluten-free menu.  not looking to return - that much money to spend on mediocrity. would have felt better having gone to apple bees, knowing that you'd get similar food for less, without having to suffer from pretension to be ""high end"" when it's not.  outdoor seating was a nice feature on fair weather days. but dining at a mall parking lot comes with a price. if no cars in sight or within earshot, ie. late at night, it's great. can't expect the same tranquility during the day.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"I went here for happy hour after work and could not believe how slow and rude the service was. The friend I met there had looked up their happy hour meal prices before going. We asked the bartender what  the specials were and she did not mention anything we saw online. We had to ask if what we had seen online was part of the happy hour special. Due to that red flag, We decided we were going to just have one drink and leave. There was only a few people at the bar and the bartender was avoiding us like the plague. It took 15 minutes just to close our tab. It was a cold winter day so we were wearing beanies and coats (covering our work clothes); so I'm guessing the bartender thought we were just some punk 20 somethings that were not going to tip well.

"Wanted this place to be at least good since it's convenient for us. Have tried it twice now. Never again. Both times were sub par. Ordered to go this last time. Took it home and found the nigiri were TINY. Small rice and small fish. We're talking smaller than any of the ""all you can eat"" places give you, but this wasn't all you can eat. Wife ordered a spider roll which they said had real crab. Indeed it did- only it was just 20% real crab with 80% of the FAKE crab. Simply false advertising. My salmon skin roll was a mix of cooked salmon and salmon skin. Something about it was off, but maybe it was just that by the time I got to it the rest of the meal had tuned me off. Fish quality was ""OK"", so not 1*. Will stick with Rickshaw and especially Oceano (great sushi. pricey, but not bad with 20% locals discount).

"Meh. Fair. The GF was craving pizza. I wanted to watch playoff football. We had never been to PW. We compromised by sitting at the bar and watching the game. The old joke goes something like........ Pizza is like sex. Even if it's bad, it's still pizza. I am in no way, shape or form equating pizza to my sex life (Love ya , honey) but let me just say I was not wowed.  Chicago deep dish is my favorite style so I tend to favor Pi/Lemmon's/Black Thorn for my pizza choices. But being a big fat guy, I have come across few pizzas I wouldn't make friends with. If you are looking for brick oven ""neopolitan"" style pizza (which is what they serve), I think The Good Pie in Midtown does it better.  The space is cool. The open kitchen concept is always appreciated to include a large strategically placed mirror that lets you see your pizza being prepared. The bar is small and kinda seems weirdly placed. It's just stuck in the front of the room and doesn't seem to fit right, to me. All things given though, it's a nice space",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"*Sigh* I really want to like this place, but I've given up. My first experience her was blah. After letting more than a year pass by and having a strong craving for Jamaican food over the weekend, i decided to give it another chance. I mean how hard is it to mess up jerk chicken? Apparently it is. I got two to go plates and when we opened them up I literally wanted to turn around and get my money back. The chicken breast was so dried out and flavorless. I couldn't even understand how they thought that was acceptable to even serve to customers. The rice and peas and veggies were fine but who wants that when ur main attraction is gross? Fortunately my husband went back up there and the staff was nice enough to give us some more chicken. I definitely won't return for it in the future though. On a more positive note, my beef patty was delicious and I would go back to get another one.

"Why 5 stars? Because after one visit, this is already one of my favorite 2020 discoveries.     ---   ---   ---  I recently came across the Flan Factory when looking up new spots and new that it would not be long before I ended up stopping in. The gap between finding Flan Factory on Yelp to sitting in the dining room was about one week and it was everything I hoped it would be.  I ordered El Tampeno (their version of a Cuban) which was delicious. It was a bit lighter than your typical Cuban, which was nice. I'm not sure if it was the airy breading or the fact that it just wasn't as jam packed (maybe both?) but it was a nice lighter meal.  I also couldn't leave here without trying Timba - fried cheese with guava dipping sauce. It's as amazing as it sounds. I highly recommend it!  And I definitely had to grab a couple of flans to-go to bring home to the wife. I was planning on ordering coconut and guava, but coconut wasn't on the menu when I visited, so I went with salted caramel instead. Both were unbelievable. No wonder the name of this place is the Flan Factory - these were the definitely the highlight item, IMO!  On top of the delicious eats, the people here were incredibly nice. They also really play up the puns. They sell t-shirts that say ""Only Flans"" and when you go to tip on your credit card, 20% is labeled ""Flantastic!""

"SUPERB!  Went to 1111 for the first time tonight and had an amazing experience.  I can't remember that last time I had such a great meal, and I eat out fairly often.  The atmosphere is really cozy and warm, yet really pretty and like, Tuscan-chic (if there is such a thing).  Seriously, I would live there.  I feel like half the night, I just sat there and basked in the wonderful, glowing feel of the place.  I started with the Shrimp and Corn Bisque, which was phenomenal.  If I hadn't had dessert, I would have labeled this as the best part of my meal.  The flavor was just so rich and wonderful.  I expect to spend hours in my own kitchen, trying to recreate it.  Which means of course, I'll have to go back to 1111 several times... for research purposes, you know...  But anyway, the spicy, cream broth paired really well with the shrimp and corn - so incredible.  For my entree, I had the Potato-Encrusted Alaskan Halibut, which was also superb.  The tender halibut filet sat atop a fantastically-seasoned bed of spaghetti squash.  And underneath the squash... surprise!  LOBSTER.  Seriously... talk about the best surprise ever.  This was all surrounded by an incredible tarragon buerre blanc sauce.  The flavor of this went so perfectly with the seafood, yet it was very subtle.  My mom had the Lobster Risotto, which was also wonderful.  It was so colorful and vibrant, with capers and goat cheese on top.   The service was top-notch.  We didn't want for anything, and our server (Denny was his name) was very knowledgeable and helpful.  I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever.  The rest of the restaurant staff was also very courteous and helpful.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, we decided to order dessert: Creme Custard Napoleon.  OH. MY. GOD.  The flavors were so rich, yet delicate at the same time.  The carameled bananas really made this dessert, along with the tiny bits of chocolate shavings.  It was the perfect amount of flavor.  That seemed to be the theme 1111's fare.  Knowing when to bring out flavors and when to mute them.  They really know what they're doing in that kitchen.  By the end of the meal, I was practically giddy with food-induced euphoria.  I think I may have just found my new favorite restaurant.

"I'm really unsure of how I want to rate this, so please read on.   Stopped in here last Saturday (7/28/18) afternoon with my 5 year old for lunch after passing this place too many times to count over the last few years, due to the location and parking situation. We opted to sit downstairs, which is order & pay upfront, self serve drinks, utensils, and seating, etc. Ordering was simple and it was nice to see the pizzas being made right there. The fountain drink selection is lacking, but I was able to make an Arnold Palmer, so that was good. The ambience was pleasant. The decor has a southern twist to it, along with country music playing, which I miss after moving back up here from NC a few years ago. What I didn't like was that all the tables were sticky and it didn't seem busy in there at all, which just tells me it was a lack of attention.   FOOD: I ordered the tater tot nachos (pic attached) that come with brisket, smoked cheese sauce, avocado cream, and pick de Gallo. I wanted to love this because I was craving comfort food with a twist, BUT the sweet potato tots were waaayy too sweet and didn't go with the rest of the dish at all, the cheese sauce wasn't all that warm and the texture was a little chalky, the pico was lacking in portion and flavor, and the brisket was only so-so. Overall, it wasn't the worst thing I've eaten, but definitely not close to my expectations.   My son had the kids chicken fingers and fries, which he really enjoyed. These seemed better than your average frozen fingers. His only complaint was the fries being too soggy.    I'm not sure if this was an off day or if we just picked the wrong food. I won't go out of my way to return, but wouldn't be against it either.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Astonishingly good value!  This is a roadside ""joint"" where you order at the counter and they bring you your food ten minutes later.  It does have some character of its own, particularly due to the friendly and helpful staff.  The reason for the five stars was the sandwiches, particularly the Philly cheese steak.  They are huge, full of meat, tasty, and decently-priced.  My wife and I made the mistake of ordering a 20 inch to split, thinking we would stack all the meat in half the sandwich.  We couldn't - there was too much meat.  We finished half and took the rest.

We started with the cheesey garlic bread appetizer for the table and they were a huge hit, then on to soup and salad, I had the minestrone soup and it was great, then on to dinner and it was the chicken Caesar salad for me, it was average at best, and then topped off with ice cream",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Yipes. I really want to like this place for dinner. After all,good pizza, good service, good food, BYOB, entertainment by a clarinet /bass duo, but I think they believe that customers will come and wait 45 minutes after reservation time, in a very hot, tiny waiting area and by overbooking,all will be fine for them.  Well it isn't, as there are other places in town. I gave no problem with a 15 minute wait, but beyond that means overbooking, and disrespect. Other restaurants do 30-45 minutes segments, ok. I can accept that. To make matters worse, the place is very very warm and without a door opened even the old of winter isn't good enough to cool off place.  After a 45 minute wait,a friend of the owner took our table for 4 and we were placed in a small booth where groups of 2 were seated.  After realizing that we waited 45 minutes for a table for four, being seated on comfortably at a Booth meant for two, we got up and left and went to dolce carini. Although we had to pay for wine, we were comfortable and entertained by piano and served great food by A very hospitable server. A great option after a very frustrating experience.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Good value too compared to the hordes that kept going to Port O Subs. I didnt understand why people wouldnt try a local joint, especially when the sandwiches were much fresher and tastier.

I can probably eat a whole bowl of salad by myself after a tournament.  All the entrees the great.

"Pizza is good but service sucks. Lacking a formal method for seating. If you go when it's crowded there is no tracking of who got there first. We came in and ordered behind another family so we were second in line and given a number to pit on our table. But no tables were available so we wait along with other family before us.   I'm watching people come in and snagging tables as soon as it's vacated. Then others arrive and they go up front to order. I ask the hostess and she says they already ordered, which was not true. The other family in front if us noticed this also and began complaining. The finally admitted the mistake and said you are supposed to order first and then wait for a table.   No instructions anywhere or no guidance by staff. Then when asked they didn't seem to care until about a dozen people were complaining. Poor customer service. It'll be hard for us to go back.

"How many yelp stars should be given to an establishment for being cool (but mostly just that and nothing more)?   Annnnd I've decided that three seems like a good answer to my own question. I've been at Penn for four years now, which means that I've probably walked by the Pod probably like 2360 times, even though I hadn't ever been inside. I wasn't particularly drawn to it from what I could see on the outside, but when I found out that our RA/GA staff end-of-year celebration this year was at the Pod, I became pretty eager... I guess my curiosity over this place had grown over time.    So, when we came in May for our staff celebration, they had set up two long tables to accommodate our large staff group. It's surprisingly spacious and I thought the type of futuristic look that they were going for was okay (even though I wasn't a fan of their bathroom design; the tiny metallic pods were kinda eerie to me).   My main impression of their food was that it was trendy, not being particularly good or bad. I might have had stronger opinions if this was coming out of my own wallet, but tbh I didn't even know the cost of what I was eating (thank you Ware!). I did really enjoy the mocktails that they offered, including their ""vanilla ginger cream soda"" and sparkling ""white bubble teas"". Oh, and they had some taro cake/ice-cream dessert topped with colorful crunchy treats that was pretty unique and tasty as well.   All in all, I'm thankful that my job allowed me to experience this place and it is one of the few fancier places in UC, but if I wanted to spend a whole lot of money on food, there's a lot of other establishments that would probably win out.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

When I lived closer to the restaurant about 9 years ago I ate here probably 2 times a week and brought all my friends and family here however the food has changed and the service was just mediocre today.   The busser/water gal was absolutely amazing, she was tentative, friendly and busting her butt to make sure we had a great experience along with the other guests in the restaurant.     The crab Rangoon was good it was more than just cream cheese which is surprisingly hard to find in Reno.  The chicken chow mein did not have much chicken but was good.

"Gallagher's is definitely a, ""Winner, Winner - Chicken Dinner"". I've heard great things about Gallagher's for years, so for the celebration of my friends 29th Anniversary of their 29th birthday, we decided to do a road trip to Waterloo. It took us only a half hour from downtown STL and it is so worth the drive. It was less time then driving out to west county.  Sunday is Family Style Chicken Dinner for $12.95. Family Style is the polite way of saying, ""It is all you can eat"". Our table was covered with a platter of crispy & juicy fried chicken, a bowl of fresh green beans with ham, another bowl of corn custard and yet another bowl of mashed potatoes and finally a gravy boat of milk gravy. Then when you are done stuffing yourself with all these home cooked delights, they offer you a piece of Susie's Sheet Cake for dessert. The flavor changes on the regular, so our flavor was Blueberry Lemon.  Fried Chicken: Large pieces, crispy crust & juicy inside, not spicy or overly salty - just perfectly seasoned.   Green Beans: Simply seasoned with ham, salt and pepper  Corn Custard: Unique in its' own way - everyone loved it once they tried it.   Mashed Potatoes - Whipped heavenly, with a very lumps to show it truly is homemade.   Milk Gravy - Life doesn't get any better then gravy made from fried chicken drippings.   Sheet cake: The sweetness and tartness of blueberries and lemon made a great finale.   The whiskey and craft beer menus will blow you away. You'll never expect the variety they offer from a small town restaurant. The birthday honoree loved their Whiskey Sour and my Manhattan had good flavor, but a tad too much vermouth for me.   The service was your typical down home, small town friendly with a twist. Some of the staff was clean as a whistle, boy/girl next door type and others were hipster/lumbersexual. Making for a nice mix of service with a smile.   I loved the fried chicken dinner and cannot wait to go back and try their ribeye.

"First time there, we sampled the sushi rolls and Chinese specials.    The rolls had excellent flavor, but they could have been rolled tighter since they tended to fall apart.    We had Pork with Garlic Sauce -- a good way to see how the kitchen handles a basic staple recipe.  It was authoritatively spicy, with flavor as one would expect.    We also had Roast Crispy Duck in Plum Sauce from the Chef's Special section of the menu.  It had a very pleasant flavor, although the crispy coating tended to detach from the duck.    Overall, an OK experience.  We expect to visit there again to sample more of the menu.  One obvious way to improve: This is a BYOB.

"Second try for the Gastropub. The serving staff were prompt and friendly. The food was pricey and a mixed bag.  We ordered a couple of Philly Cheesesteaks with sides. The sandwiches where tasty but not incredible - not if you really know what a Cheesesteak is. Seemed a bit greasy too. Still, for ""movie food,"" not bad. The fries where crisp. The tater tots where awful, kind of soggy. Probably just a bag of frozen tots.  Most disappointing was the beer. I ordered a Coppertail Unholy, one of my favs from a local brewery. I was served in a 6 ounce plastic cup, which is ridiculous for this beer. Anywhere else in town you'll get the usual 12 ounce pour minimum.  Total bill about $45, which is just crazy for one eentsy-teensy beer and two Cheesesteaks. I think I'm done trying this theatre restaurant.

"I have been to this location twice now, and both times it was disappointing. Tonight I got there at 7:30, and the people working behind the counters were busy closing down. They had not much out that looked fresh. There was only a few leg pieces of fried chicken left, and they had moved them from the normal spot and shut down the chicken area already.   One of the reasons I went there was for the ribs I had seen on their ads. Well that special was over last week I guess, since there were no ribs at all. One of the other things I like at this place is their pot roast. The pot roast here was more fat than meat, and was not cooked with the vegetables, so the flavor just wasn't there.   Since there were no ribs I tried to get a steak. It took two minutes to get someone to get me a piece of steak. They would not grill a fresh steak, since they had shut the grill down. They did this before 8 pm, and the restaurant is open until 10 pm.   I was not able to eat the salad I made, because someone had put blue cheese into the ranch dressing. I heard several people complain about this, but nothing was done to fix the issue.

"I remembered Aunt Polly's being great when I was a kid.  I don't think I'd had any food from there since the 90s.  It was on my list of places to try ever since I came back to the Indy area.  After moving back to the east side after twenty-plus years, I finally got some Aunt Polly's delivery just before the new year.    It was a Friday night, and they were apparently extremely busy.  I was asked to hold, and the phone was set down where I could hear several other orders being taken.  I decided to hang up and called back a little later, hoping to let the rush die down.  I was able to place my order right away when I called back.  I ordered way too much, but I was entertaining kids.  The wait was over an hour and a half.  The delivery driver was nice.  The food on the other hand was not so great.  One of the pizzas seemed undercooked with a heavy, doughy crust and gooey cheese, while the other two spent a little too much time in the oven.  They had dark, tough cheese and large charred pieces falling off the underside.    The breadsticks were the worst I have ever had.  Heavy, undercooked, and inedible.  I even tried to bake the breadsticks longer in the oven later on, but I ultimately threw most of them away.  Some of the food seemed to have sat around a while longer than the rest.  Along with the cold marinara and nacho cheese that came with the breadsticks, the breaded mushrooms I got were lukewarm, soggy, and falling apart.  A far cry from what I remember way back when.  Their mushrooms used to be my favorite thing on the menu.  I didn't try them myself, but the mozzarella sticks seemed to be a hit.  They appeared to be hot and crisp.  The leftover mozz sticks reheated well along with the breaded tenderloin.  The tenderloin was eaten by the biggest food critic I know, so it must have been good since there were no complaints.  The best thing we received was the side salad.  Even though it was made with Iceberg, it was fresh and came with a lot of toppings.  It was better than the side salads at most places.  Of course, the cheapest thing I ordered was the star of this mess.  It was highly disappointing to drop so much money and receive so little especially when most of the food was barely edible.   My memories of Aunt Polly's have been permanently crushed.  I doubt that I would order from here again.  Such a waste.  I still cringe with regret.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

Every topping was inconsistent almost to the point that we had a pizza that had slice with black olives and green peppers and another slice with mushrooms, onions and Roma tomatoes and yet another couple of pieces with a little of everything - no cheese - you get the picture. Also the flavor was not there AT ALL. The cheese layer was almost non-existent and there was plenty of barren real estate around the edges - lots of crust. Also most of the toppings were shifted to one side. We have two remaining pieces that the dog may get to enjoy.  We might give them another shot, might not.

"Visiting from LA, we had a fantastic meal here with relatives who live locally. What impressed us a lot was the use of local ingredients prepared with care and imagination. The six of us shared a number of starters that allowed us to sample the menu widely. The KFC cauliflower was a crowd pleaser, with the right balance of crunch, sweetness and spicy kick. Lots of restaurants in L A serve  roasted marrow bones, and Taverna 1903's version is just as good - if not better - than anything we've had at fine restaurants at home. We also tried two salads: gem and the great big salad. Both had farm fresh ingredients and were absolutely delish.   The six of us shared three entrees for the second course. The short ribs were fork tender and flavorful. Salmon was a hit, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The grilled steak also was cooked to a perfect temperature, and was very satisfying.

And, when I say horrendous, I mean nearly 30 minutes before we saw a server (the place was not busy). We saw her when the food came, but never saw her again. We had to flag down someone else to ask for another beer and water, though the water never came. Then, we waited a good bit at the end of the evening trying to catch a glimpse of her to get a check, eventually just going to the front of the place and asking for it.   Then, of course, charged $50 on a $24 bill.  I talked to a manager by phone who sounded pretty aggravated to field the call. Their calls roll to their personal phones. Service industry don't live in the office... It wasn't the attitude you would expect on calling to report an overcharge, and there was even a tone at one point like I might be making this shit up or something.  I didn't hear back from him for 5 days, at which point I contacted the owner.  He was sympathetic and accommodating at first,  and agreed to refund the entirety of my bill.   I waited for 2 weeks, but the check never came.  I contacted him again and he was less than caring. A reply email that he meant to mail it 2 weeks ago; but had an emergency; but actually did just run across it yesterday and it was on its way.  The check did arrive after another request, but not only was it not for the entire bill, it was not even for the entire amount of the overcharge.   He did include 2 tickets to get in the door; like I would want to experience this again.  Both of these guys double-talked so much they couldn't keep it all straight, not for some schmuck like me. It was palpable when you talked to them and evident in their actions.  It took 5 phone calls, 2 emails, and 25 days to receive a $20 check (not even the entire amount I was overcharged). I paid $25 to park, $22 to get in the door, and $50 for a sandwich and 2 beers to be afforded this experience.  Like I said, the music was good and the place was cool,  but Nashville is eaten up with cool music places.  Spend your money somewhere else. This place does not care about its patrons; plenty of tourists in Nashville.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"So here's the scoop, I've walked by this place a million times to go to a movie and it was just never convenient to go try. Boyfriend got a living social so we went after a movie, on a Saturday but the deal was for during the week only (missed that fine print) but we were there, we were hungry. When trying new pizza places I always just go for a pepperoni. To me you an tell a place by that pie alone.  The pizza comes out, delicious bubbly goodness. Right amount of cheese. Sauce is AMAZINGLY perfect. You can taste the tomato without it being acidic or overpowering. The pepperoni is flavorful and in plenty. Now the crust....key to a good pizza...it's thin...it's crisp in all the right places and that yummy yeasty doughy flavor on the inside.   How have I never been in here before! I'm kicking myself in the ass for all the great pizza I've missed.  My ONLY request.....they open a location in the Northwest. We have nothing but chains up here and although we'll make a drive for good pizza (grimaldis, pieface) it would be great to have a ""mom and pop"" joint up here that takes such great pride in their pizza.   I'm sure I'm not the ONLY one who would LOVE THIS!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

"Met a group of GFs here for drinks and dinner on a Friday night. Had great service from drinks to dessert. Staff was friendly, and food was fantastic.  On a recommendation I had the cucumber collins. This was a refreshing surprise and perfect way to kick off a Friday after shopping.  Oysters were delicious. Spicy Asian shrimp appetizer is spicy. If you don't like spicy probably should steer clear. I like spicy so was happy it had a kick. Crab dip was very good. I had the lobster/shrimp stuffed cod. Fantastic. Friends ordered Cedar Plank Salmon, and Shang Hai Seafood Sampler. All complimented their dishes. Finished with the chocolate cake. Spent a few hours here and never felt rushed or uncomfortable. Also, took advantage of the open table reservations online so no worry about the wait on a Friday :)",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Came here at 5:30 on a Tuesday during restaurant week. They are on Open Table which is always a plus for me. We were seated immediately upon arrival by a nice and friendly hostess. Our server came over in an appropriate amount of time to take our order.   This place is pretty huge in my opinion and offers a variety of rooms, each offering something different in terms of ambiance and decor...which I appreciate. The front area where the bar is has a really cool vibe. It's old school but sort of gothic. It reminds me of the tower of terror for some reason. Lol. I don't know why. I wish we were seated up front. The back room was nice, too. There's one window seat that I would have loved to sit at but it was already taken. It was verrrry quiet for the majority of time that we were there. As we were leaving around 7:30 it was full and VERY loud....to the point that it was difficult to hear each other. Some of the other rooms were still quiet. I think you can choose a room based on your desired ambiance (if you know going into it).   Chips and salsa were brought to the table...chipotle salsa and a fresh pico. Both were delicious.   We ordered from the restaurant week menu.   Apps: I got the mushroom and black bean empanadas. My Dad got the dual empanadas so 1 mushroom and 1 beef, (each one cut into two pieces). I thought they were really good.   Entrees: my Dad got filet and shrimp. He gave it 8 out of 10 stars. I got cheese enchiladas with tomatillo sauce. Both served with rice and black beans. My enchiladas were delicious. I would have preferred a bit more sauce but that's a personal preference. I did not ask for more but I'm sure they would have brought it. They were very cheesy. Yum!  Dessert: Dad got Tres Leches cake and I got Chocolate Mousse cake. It was not the best I've had. It tasted pre made. Like something that would be shipped to a restaurant and they would slice and serve. I could be wrong. It was alright but not great.   Our server was excellent. She answered all of my questions and offered suggestions. She checked to make sure everything was correct and delicious. She took care of the check quickly when my Dad was in the bathroom so I could beat him to it. The person assisting her was also great. Quick to clear plates and wrap up leftovers. Friendly. Non intrusive.   The bathrooms were clean. Four stalls. No waiting. Sinks were clean. Toilets were clean and functional.   I was sad they didn't have Chambord to make a Chambord Margarita. We ordered sparkling water. I was sad it wasn't really cold. The waitress did bring me a straw and lime like I asked, which I appreciated because many people forget.   Can't beat restaurant week. It's just a coincidence we came here during restaurant week. We looked at the regular menu, too but ultimately preferred the restaurant week offerings anyway. 3 course meal for 2 people, $79 plus tip.   Fancier Mexican food than most places but if you're into that, I would recommend it here. I would return.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0

"Never been here, and my impression was its an artisan pizza ria, with hand made meatballs, and pizza straight like you're in NY, but, um, no. Bruschetta was something I could have made in my kitchen, with cheap bread, and just some diced tomatoes tossed in top. Very unappealing to the eye. Not to mention, I've never been anywhere that gives you small containers with oil and balsamic to pour over it. There was only enough oil and balsamic for one piece, so I had to ask for more. Got charged $4. Nice.  Got a side of meatballs. Came out and immediately knew, I wouldn't be back. You can tell they are just frozen little balls. Ate one, bout puked.

Came here because I knew the horchata is really good but the food doesn't live up to the drinks here.  The watermelon agua fresca was one of the best I've had.  The best things here were the #16 especial the homemade torillas.  The peppers and the cheese in the #16 give it that extra layer of flavor which I loved.  Not bad: Sopas de Pollo Guac  Would Skip: adobada tacos: they were dry and had absolutely no flavor rajas tacos: its just cheese with green peppers and onions  For being a small taco shop this place isn't cheap but that didn't stop the massive lines which they constantly had.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Definitely a great Chipotle. It's hard to rate chain restaurants because a lot of the things you would rate them on are beyond their control - Pricing, menu, etc. However you can talk about how well they served you. The staff here is always super nice. I definitely see familiar faces when I come in here. They also do a great job of preparing the food. It's packed and not sloppily played. They also maintain a great level of cleanliness that other Chipotles are lacking. One staff member in particular , he's usually on register goes out of the way for the guests and went around to personally check in with customers when there was no longer a line. Nice touch and he wasn't pushy! Overall, good Chipotle stop! Oh and I like the actual setup of this store.

"It's mediocre, that's really all I can say. The interior of the restaurant is a chaotic mess, but that's no sin because most of us are probably just there to pick up an order to go. The General Tso's chicken is bland and dry, a very unpleasant texture but the flavor wasn't too terrible. The so-called fried rice is very obviously just yellow rice mixed with barely any pieces of meat and lots of undercooked onion. The eggroll is small and overlooked, with an unremarkable filling.   I would consider this a reasonably inexpensive Chinese takeout place for people who don't know better. After eating here, I actually felt bad for anyone who considers this good Chinese food, because they're doing themselves a disservice by not going somewhere better.   Will not be returning here. Not because it's terrible, but just because there are much better options for Chinese takeout in the area; in terms of quality and value.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Terrible experience, and we (my boyfriend and I) rarely ever feel that way. It was a busy Friday night, so we expected to wait, but not everything else we experienced. It took several minutes for the host to even take our name down, and we could tell it was a disorganized mess. We finally got our name in and sat a table in the patio area to wait, like many others were. After about 30 minutes some of the servers started bringing a few of the people waiting water and chips and salsa. We thought that was a nice gesture, but we and some of the other tables never received any. Throughout our wait we also saw many other parties seated that had arrived after us. About another 20 minutes went by and we were finally seated.   The waiter came by and took our drink order and brought us water. A couple minutes later another waiter/waitress came by, and looked confused that we had already ordered our drinks and walked off seemingly perturbed about that. The waiter then dropped off our drinks but didn't take our order. We sat for 15-20 minutes and no one came by to take our order or check on us. Finally the waiter came by with more drinks in his hand, looking confused that we had already had drinks (by this point we had finished them), and then just walked away. My boyfriend flagged him down and asked him if we could just get the check, and he had no problem bringing that and picking up the card right away. We spent probably a total of an hour and a half there just to get some stale chips and a drink for each of us. We know that restaurants are under an immense staffing crisis; however, the other tables around us seemed to have sufficient service. Not sure if it was just a fluke night or what, but the whole experience was enough to make us not want to go back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

Hoo-shi is not what we want. We want sushi, and in Indy... step one: eat sushi on Friday or Saturday. The fresher the better and fresh fish starts on Fridays and goes down hill from there.

I look forward to returning, and siting at the sushi bar -- and finding a designated driver because the sake selection is pretty deep and I could keep that goin' until I think I'm seafaring sushi monger.

"We came here on the recommendation of it being ""good asian food"".  We went in despite the instinct to run from any restaurant that tries to be more of a ""production"" or ""show"" than a fine place to eat.  The waiter was, as expected, over-friendly to the point of extreme annoyance as he tried to tell us what was ""great"" on the menu and how every dish was his favorite.  Yeah, sure.  The food was OK, and when biased for the rest of the food I had while Tampa, I have to admit it was above average.  But not by much.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We last visited the Phily Diner and Sports Bar in September and I left a review on Facebook (with no comment from the site). We wanted to leave it here on Yelp as well.  I haven't eaten here in a while but we were craving some club sandwiches for lunch and decided to order to pick-up. What an absolute waste of money. Neither sandwich was made the way I asked (neither had the addition I'd asked for when I placed the order), the bread tasted day-old, the meat was dry, and the sandwiches had no flavor. I know I ordered to pick-up, but there's no way I can fathom that the fries we were served were fresh. By the way - if you throw hot fries on top of a cold sandwich and then seal them in a take-out container, you end doing something akin to steaming your sandwiches. The second time I walked in (because I came back in for something from the bakery) I was greeted by a girl with a smug attitude and had to witness a customer berating the girl trying to check people out (no manager in site, no one to hep her). The only reason I'm giving two-stars here on Yelp is because the cheesecake was good. I used to really like going here, but it seems like some of the quality got lost in the shuffle during the transition to glitz and glamour.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

The lasagna is fantastic, and the salmon..that's difficult to describe. It was melt in my mouth, flavor from heaven. I highly recommend this dish!

"This is a quiet spot in Green Hills with a nice patio. When we walked in, there was no host & we waited for awhile at the host stand for someone to acknowledge us. The host was kind of rude considering that we had a reservation & everything.   I was a bit surprised at how brief the drink list was. Given that there were only two cocktails listed, I was hesitant to try one, but the wine & beer list was quite short for a nice place like this. There was only one of each wine varietal, so not much of a selection, and just a handful of beers. Moreover, my boyfriend tried to order one of the few beers & they were out of it.   For dinner, we shared the 10oz filet mignon & white cheddar truffle Mac. Although we ordered the filet medium, it came out medium well/well done. The mashed potatoes  that it came with had very little flavor, but the green beans were good. The mac, however, was absolutely out of this world! The rich umami of the truffle was perfectly balanced with the sharp cheddar, and the top was nice & crisp.   One of the bussers grabbed my glass of wine when there was still a bit left, which is my dining pet peeve. That made us feel rushed despite the fact that our dinner was pretty quick.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"My friend suggested Cafe Audrey and I had been once before and liked it, so I agreed. I love any kind of chicken and saw tenders on their menu and the waitress said they were great, so I ordered them. When I took my first bite, I almost took it back out. They were so bad. I mean inedible bad. I told the waitress and she asked if I wanted anything else, so I said pancakes (I had gotten those the first time and loved them). When I got the bill, not only was I charged for the chicken I didn't eat but also the pancakes. Really? You don't even stand by your food at all? The worst part about it is that my friend was treating and she had to pay for two meals for me instead of just one. I will never go here again because of this experience.

The staff was friendly and our order was taken easily. Then off to find a clean table, which we did. Our meal was brought out very quickly. WOW - amazing flavor!! The beans were so good, it was the first thing we went after. I ordered the chicken flautas and my husband ordered the carne asada platter. This place did not disappoint at all.

The wait person taking care of us was the ""new owner"". She forgot to bring our appetizer, we told her to forget it, just bring the main meal. She brought it anyway. The meal was so awful neither my partner nor myself ate more than 2 or 3 bites. Believe me, we are NOT fussy eaters. This was horrible. When she came to ask if we wanted containers, we tried to tell her we were absolutely not satisfied and all she wanted to do was defend  her cooks.

The place was pretty quiet even though it was about 11p on a Saturday night, definitely not a night lounge spot but seems more like a restaurant with a bar. The bartender was quirky but very friendly to us. As compared to some of the other neighborhoods we visited in Nashville, this seemed more like a local spot and many patrons seemed to know one another.

"This place was awesome! We were able to put our name down and check our place in line using Yelp, which meant we got to stroll around and explore while we waited for a table. The wait for 2 was about 30 min at 11am on a Friday morning. We ordered the skinny miga, which was so satisfying with the soft texture of the scramble and the crunchy tortilla strips. If you want to get the french toast cinammon sticks, they are similar to churros and it is best to share among a few friends as they are very sweet. We could barely have 2 of them and boxed the rest. The sweet vanilla cold coffee is refreshing and not overly sweet. This is a great brunch option in the Quarter for vegetarians as they don't focus on the typical New Orleans seafood here. Walkable from the major hotels, which was a nice plus. My friends had some great drinks here, too, if that is your thing.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0

It's not really a pizza ""buffet."" A couple of pizzas are placed on a counter under some heat lamps which don't keep the pizza hot. Our pizza slices were close to room temperature. Also, I would not describe the pizza we had as deep dish but more like thick crust.   Some of the pictures posted here make the pizza look way better than the pizza we had. Atleast one other person has questioned whether the pizza served on the pizza ""buffet"" is different than the pizza ordered off of the regular menu. If so, not a good way to get people to come back.

"This place is on track to join the other pizza places near me that I won't bother with anymore. I have been going to them, more often than not, for my pizza and wings fix since they were in their old location on N. Olden Ave.. To be honest, they never were ""Wow! Their food is so good!""... but it was ok-good, and their combo specials made up for it. They used to have a plain pie, 14 wings and 2 ltr soda for approx $20 special. Most area places do 10 or 12 wings, so I was ok with at least getting volume for my money (their wings are really good, so I was glad to get a couple extra). Sometime not to long ago they reduced to wings to 10. So now their special isn't as special. About the pizza- basically, it's very bland. No tomato flavor, no cheese flavor, no salt, no garlic, no oregano, the pepperoni is blah... I end up having to ""doctor it up"". And the pie I got last night was a mess... the toppings were skimpy and were all clumped together near the middle and nothing by the edges.. it just didn't look like whoever made it took any time with it.

When I pointed out that there were 2 toppings covering the entire pizza, and then a split where it was 1/2 of one topping and another 1/2 of a different topping still equals 3 toppings. She had to get the manager. The manager then told me it was because I had ordered 1/2 side with Anchovies (trying to eat ""better"" ). I said that should have been disclosed when I ordered. I walked... they did not hold up to their end of the bargain and did not inform me of the increase of price on the phone! I would have been ok if I knew ahead of time of the extra charge, or would have ordered different toppings.

Saw cooks and servers walking around in their plaid pajamas and flip flops, not shaven !!! That is such a poor first impression !  Should hire someone who can speak good English and not shake their heads so much !!! (I mean the Indian head shake??? ) Please don't do that !   One guy had sweat pants and sneakers, he was ushering people in, and he seemed to be talking in good English (the American kind, with an accent) and a customer who was non-indian asked if they serve Naans and Vegetable Korma and he said ""Yes we serve everything"" and he asked one of the servers at the register if they serve Vegetable Korma but the server at the register just could not understand him and asked him to repeat it 3 times and finally was able to understand the guy and did the Indian head nod again !!!   When they took our order, the first guy who took the order left and someone else came by and asked if we wanted to order coffee or tea - we had just placed our lunch order ! Who drinks coffee and tea before an Indian lunch ? Maybe some people do, but we don't get asked if we want coffee or tea, we get asked ""what do we want to drink?""   For the ambience and all the talk about the wonderful food they serve, nice looking website and pictures and all that write up about how authentic their food is, their method of cooking and all that talk about nizams and royals, I felt it was a big let down.  This sealed it - When our food came, it was cold. The biriyani looked and smelled great but as soon as we served it on our plates from the extra small plates that comes heaped with the biriyani - it was cold in the middle of the dish and the piece of chicken was ice cold ! Huge Let down no. 2. There was a spoon and a fork but no knife.   And oh, just for laughs, they have a painting of ""Buddha / Mahaveer Jain"" at the entrance - just thought it was funny that we are all killing animals and eating and Buddha promoted ""Ahimsa"" , he was a vegetarian. And the music he had on was soooooo bad ...   Your goal should be ""How am I different from the other Indian restaurants in the area that have been serving good Indian food for years already"" and ""How can I make a good first impression on people""  You have the location, the ambience, the cool website and the owner who gave up his IT career to open this place - to your advantage !

"The hell? I've never reviewed this place? Aight, here we go.  Nam Phuong is a good spot. I just can't give it 4 stars because it doesn't excel in any of the dishes that I love getting at other Viet spots that I love.  I feel bad writing that, but it's true. When I have their pho, I'm thinking of Choo Choo (Pho Xe Lua Viet Thai). When I have their cha gio or grilled meats, I'm thinking of Vietnam Palace. When I have their vermicelli... well, vermicelli was always just a standard for me that never really stood out anywhere, so they pass on that.  They prepare their beef salad - drained raw flank steak marinated in lime juice and tossed with herbs, peanuts, and fried shallots - in the style that Cambodians do, using ample sawleaf herb and some other things I don't know the names for in English. But, even that is done better, in my opinion, at Khmer Kitchen.  Don't get me wrong - if anyone suggests we go get a bite at Nam Phuong, I'm the last to shoot them down. It's a wide open pair of dining rooms separated by a low wall, you never feel crowded, and it IS authentic, genuinely good food. The service is prompt and friendly enough. And hey - cheap liquor and beer if you're so inclined.  But, again, all of those things are available at other places that I tend to enjoy more.  You will likely enjoy every dish you get here, and portions are heart-attack large. That makes this place solid.  But, again, for me, they're in that middle space where I can't think of one thing that I prefer at Nam Phuong above other restaurants.

Smallish place with modern decor but still piping in mariachi music.  Outdoor seating also available.  Counter service for ordering food with table delivery.  I ordered the barbacoa quesadilla with calabacitas, my wife got the chicken taquitos with the smashed beans.  The entrees came out quickly and piping hot.  My quesadilla was a large corn tortilla filled with lightly spiced barbacoa, cheese and the house Seis sauce, plus a serving of the medium hot salsa.  The medium hot salsa is basically a souped up tomatillo sauce, but it had a nice flavor with just a hint of bite to it.  The calabacitas only contained zucchini and yellow squash, but they do tell you that on the menu.  It was o.k., but nothing special.  My wife's chicken taquitos were lightly fried and tasted decent, but again nothing special.

I ordered the steak burrito and there is so much meat stuffed inside! They also give you a generous portion of sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole on top.

"I love Cuban food, but my favorite Cuban restaurant is too far for me to make the spontaneous decision of going there. When I found a reliable Cuban restaurant near me I got excited. This front of the restaurant is hidden from the street and even though I must have driven past it many times I didn't know of its existence until I googled local Cuban restaurants. I like to order the Cuban Sandwich at least once at every restaurant for my own mental record. So, in between shifts one day, I decided to try Plato Latino's sandwich, as they also claimed it was voted number 1 in Tampa.   The Cuban Sandwich wasn't as delectable as some of the greasy, heavy options you can find in Tampa, but it has its place. The Cuban was simple, keeping the few usual ingredients you find in an authentic Cuban. It's a great option for a cheaper and less physically tolling meal. The price was fair for the size of the sandwich, if you're really hungry I would suggest getting a side with it.  Lastly, the service was quick and the employees were polite. The two employees in view from the dining area were wearing masks, but I saw a cook come from the back with no face covering at all.

At the drive thru window,  I  asked to speak to  a manager. I told him the fries had a chemical taste to them.

Needless to say, I threw her kid's meal away and headed to evos.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"Are you looking for a solid, healthy meal at a decent price? Check out Ciccio's. I frequently order the Brazilian bowl. Spicy chicken, rice, lettuce. It does the trick, my hunger is cured. And I leave the table still feeling light, not heavy and sluggish. But I'm not overwhelmed with flavor or freshness. I often leave thinking ""I could make that (if I wasn't so lazy!)"". They have a decent selection of wine and some bottle beers but if you're going alcohol free, the tea's are pretty good.  The layout of the store has recently changed. The older format was darker, smaller and more intimate. The new layout allows many more seats and is very bright and more family family. To each their own, but I preferred the old design (even with my kids in tow).  The outdoor seating isn't very relaxing because this location is right next to a very busy Publix.  Lots of cars passing by, lots of foot traffic with squeaky carts trudging by.  If you're in St. Pete, it's worth a trip. If you're over in Tampa, no need to make a special trip.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"100% the BEST breakfast/brunch place in the world ! On weekends be prepared for a wait. We waited 2.5 hours in line. I used Yelp to get a spot in line ahead of time but we still had to wait. I got a text at 11:07am saying we had been added to the wait list and we got there about 11:30. You have to check in when you get there. It seemed like even though we put our name on the list and we're given a time , they still wen by the time we actually got there. We were not seated till 2:10pm . But per usual we were served Ruby Mimosa, Peach  Bellinis , and ICEd coffee. Got to get there early to avoid a long wait. But trust me it IS worth it!!!!! There is no place like home !!!! 4 stars only because of the wait.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 4.0
I stopped by as I was leaving target I was thirsty so decided I would order a drink. The reason for the one star review is the Starbucks is very busy and only had one person working I waited in line and then had to wait an additional 10 minutes before the lady could take my order then when she did take my order she was rude. They also need to check their Expiration dates on their evolution fresh drinks as many of them were expired and usually I wouldn't mind but they are very perishable items. Then I got my drink and there was barely and fruit pieces in it. Probably one of the worst Starbucks experiences ever.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"Not too long after a disappointing visit to An American Place, we approached Niche with pretty high expectations.  The three of us opted to order our own appetizers and entrees without taking advantage of the 3 course deal.  I started out with the roasted eggplant soup, which was nicely velvety reminiscent of the glop I scarfed down at many an Indian friends' place.  I really really wanted some bread to go with this (naan, anyone?) but alas, there was none to be had.  Even asking the waitress about it she politely mentioned that we could get the cheese plate... to get the bread o_O.  When I'm paying that much for a meal, I'd hope a small request for such a thing as a bit of bread would be easily taken cared of.  The pork cheeks, however, were a pleasant surprise.  Even though I think the foie gras used was from a can, the hong shao style braised pork cheeks with the pear gave a great flavor along with the chili pepper.  This was pretty well thought out.  The butter poached shrimp was a sort of conundrum, though.  What were we supposed to do?  Put the avocado stuff on the chip with the shrimp?  Shouldn't I have more chip and less avocado, then?  3 shrimp?  Proportions, damnit!  It was pretty darned tasty though.    After the appetizers those high expectations were definitely being met.  We had the rotisserie chicken, the scallops, and the rib eye.    The scallops were amazing.  They were ginormous.  The butter foam really worked.  The bitterness of the greens kinda worked with the sweet scallops but they were ok.  The guy who ordered the rib eye was severely disappointed.   - ""When I get rib eye I expect fat, damnit!"" It was pretty dry, almost like a filet.  I honestly don't know why the fiance orders the roasted chicken all the time.  She doesn't like white meat and doesn't like it when her chicken is too dry.  Mind you, there's a fine line between ""good"" and ""too dry"" in her mind.  Sauce won't help out either.  I forget just how much that entree was, but I think it was in the high 20's.  There are plenty of other nice restaurants with far superior roasted chicken than the one that we had for much less.  However we were discussing this dish and we came the this conclusion: - Chicken, 13 bucks. - the rest?  the freaking watermelon foam.  Great.  It didn't even make it taste any better.  I was expecting it to have some crazy dynamic but it didn't.  We were considering getting dessert but the birthday girl was too annoyed with her chicken so we left.    I thought the food was very good.  However, at this level, I'd expect far superior service and something to differentiate it from the many other bistro-esque places in St. Louis.  The ideas were interesting but the execution on the basic stuff (steak / chicken) needs some work.  So appetizers: 2 for 3. Entrees: 1 for 3.  This place was ""pretty good"" and worth the visit, if only to appreciate the other places that St. Louis has to offer just a bit more.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

Perfectly poached eggs served with black forest ham and a delightful Charon sauce, placed on a grilled Ciabatta roll. Extraordinary! My wife had their Quiche of the Moment. This day it was the Quiche Lorraine with bacon Swiss cheese and onion. Very nice! Our friend had the house made granola with Greek yogurt. We also had the carrot cake featured on the show.

"The overall ambiance of the restaurant is great and the service is wonderful.  The food did not blow my mind.  It's high quality and well made dishes, but the flavors were good, but not amazing.  Worst part was that I had to take some food home, including the Parker House rolls, and they didn't include the chive butter!  Dry bread?!    This is what we ordered:  Cheese Plate: It was good, but not a great mix of cheeses.  It had a lot of goat cheese and there weren't a lot of great accompaniments like honey, sauces, etc.    Purist Poke: This is was probably the most unique and delicate dish of the night.  Great flavors from the salmon with the delicious hawaiian salt and avocado.  Great combination of flavors.  Parker House Rolls: I know it's ""healthyfied"" since they're whole wheat, but they are just not indulgent like regular Parker House rolls.  It's not buttery and creamy with a hint of sweetness and salt.  The chive butter is very delicious.    Brisket Pappardelle:  Great, fresh pasta.  Savory brisket.  The dish is just a bit one note.  No crunch, no sweet, no acid.  Just savory.  It was good, but not great.  Salmon dish: My dinner guest got that dish.  Great crispy skin, but again, nothing amazing.  Cast Iron Cake: I never had rhubarb before and it sounded good.  It was good.  I do not enjoy really strong ginger flavor, so the ice cream wasn't for me.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"Prasino is a very trendy restaurant and I really enjoyed eating there. My friends and I hit this place up for brunch on a Saturday and we had a good time. Around that time they had both the brunch and lunch menus available so even though the menus were small, there was still a lot of variety.  I chose to order from the lunch menu and got Short Rib Tacos for $13.00. The tacos were really good, it tasted very authentic especially since they used corn tortillas and salsa that had just enough heat to spice up the flavors. Both of my friends ordered from the brunch menu, Short Rib Skillet for $13.00 and Paris Eggs Benedict for $12.00. They both said that they liked their dishes and aesthetically speaking, I can agree because everything looked super appetizing.  The prices may seem a little steep but the portions were decent and the restaurant just had a very nice ambiance. I loved even the amber glass bottles and cups that they used for water, very classy. My only issue is probably the slowness of service. It's a very big restaurant but it wasn't that packed so I don't know why it took about 25 minutes for food to come out. Our server checked on us a couple of times but his service wasn't outstanding which doesn't seem up to par with the upscale vibe of the restaurant.

"The portions have diminished significantly. Whereas before I might not have finished a burrito or gogi bowl, I now leave still feeling hungry and wondering if my money could have been better spent elsewhere. In fact, I'm certain of it. As difficult as it may be, because the quality of the food is still quite high, I will not be patronizing Seoul taco again. It is utterly disingenuous to charge the same prices for dishes that contain at best 60% of the food they used to. I would rather pay more and get a satisfying meal, than sit at a table looking at a burrito that is more tortilla than pretty much anything else. I'm deeply saddened by the direction the restaurant has gone in. Maybe the costs incurred as a result of the recent move have caused this. I don't know.  All I hope for is that the management sees the error of their ways and brings back the previous portions (at a higher cost if need be).",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"Beef Dip and Mac and Cheese  This place is all about the comfort food. Had the beef dip here cause my group chat was blowing up about beef dips. The BD had beef brisket, caramelized onion, russian dressing Got a good thick bread on it to absorb the dip. Good taste and while it's not the best i've had but it is far from the worst. Mac and cheese was on sale for 7 bucks that day too and tasted sub par. It was comprised of cavatappi noodles, sharp cheddar cheese, garlic toast. I felt the noodles were a bit tough to eat and thought that the dish should be called Cav and cheese for obvious reasons. Shout out to the garlic toast though.

"Pretty delish...for a place that makes you cook your own food. :) I did enjoy myself, but since I am not a heavy dipper when it comes to sauces or really a big or fast eater, we would have needed another hour just to get through our main course (there 2 hours already); had to take a rain check on dessert.   Of course though, I was on a first date. So, let's get to what's important, already! I mean, the place...you cook your own food! If the food is bad, its um, your fault.   The service was excellent, but I was on a first BLIND date and thankfully the conversation wasn't lagging at all. However, constant interruptions re: food, temperature, more wine (duh!), next course was distracting if you actually attempt to have a conversation, but Ashley was spot on.   First Course: Bread chunks, green apple slices, and cut up veggies to be dipped in a brie and whocaresitwasdeliciousness mixture...which because we talked so much actually started to burn.   Second Course: salad. (crickets)   Third Course: MEAT! The dipping stuff was a wine based liquid heated with GARLIC. Dip a shoe in it and its good. REMEMBER: Stick your skewers in there and as you are enjoying what you have just cooked, have something else in the pot ready to go when you finish the tiny morsel of what ever moo'd, swam, clucked or quacked; hence another reason we missed dessert.   Wine poured and consumed through out the entire 2 hours... Date still cute! Food still good...holy crow its 8:20! WE GOTTA JET!   Management is used to this, I'm guessing.

"A nice venue for a wedding.  Had our wedding there late fall so we were not able to appreciate the total ambience of the river and grounds.   Be aware it is not handicap friendly.  As for the restrooms there is a high end trailer type facility, not very nice.  Also we had to demand a separate handicap restroom/porta potty.   As for the caterer Jamie Hollander, I was disappointed in the food.  We opted for the basic package.  Cocktail hour was mediocre at best.  We paid extra for the seafood spread.  Although plentiful, not impressed with the quality.   Our main course dinner was also a disappointment. This place is not cheap by any standards, most of your dollars are for the administrative fees and service fees and the charge of their equipment, tables, china, flat ware, etc.   Also they charge you for everything with a high mark up.  We were charged $810. for heat powered by propane.  If you are considering this venue serviced by Jamie Hollander catering read and question every line and detail of the proposal.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"""Authentic Thai""? ""Best Thai food ever""? I've been to a lot of thai places in my life, this one was pretty terrible. The food had no flavor, no spice, and all tasted vaguely packaged. I ordered spring rolls and vegetable pad Thai, the spring rolls were clearly store bought. The pad Thai had no flavor, the vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots) were obviously previously frozen, possibly nuked in the microwave and thrown on top.  I had high expectations for this place but nothing was tasty at all. Avoid, avoid, avoid.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
"It's dark and cozy, which is really all that matters. The ambiance is perfect for a late, rainy night--modern and artsy, with lots of dark woods and reds.   Having just come from a workout at the SBCC track, my cohort and I decided to replenish our glycogen stores with a nourishing snack of creme brulee. Just one. With two spoons. Very delicious. He also really enjoyed the glass of port that was recommended to him by our waitress. We were so satiated afterward, there was no need for dinner.

"Very odd to say the least. We ordered food got an appetizer, larb dish, and another dish. Our first 2 dishes came pretty much at the same time and we were completely finished eating before our last dish even came out. Our server didn't check on us once and I was in need of multiple things, he was intentionally avoiding our table and it wasn't busy at all. We had to ask for help from someone else because our server was everywhere except by us! The food is like 1/5 also, the pork belly and broccoli dish was literally all broccoli with a tiny bit of pork belly we didn't eat it cause it came out extremely late. The larb was a sweet sweet larb that was stir fried nothing like what I was used to and had an odd stench to it. I would pass on this place if I were thinking on eating here. The Thai tea was great tho.  Update: my stomach has been turning and in knots since I ate here. Haven't been able to stomach anything since then.  Another update: it's been a full 24hrs since we've eaten here and still haven't been able to stomach anything and I'm pretty sure we both are experiencing food poisoning symptoms.

"The setting:  It's right across from the Eastern State Eastern State Penitentiary on the corner of 21st and Fairmount. I came here when it was Mugshots Coffeehouse and fell in love with the decor. My sister lives close by and suggested it for lunch. OCF renovated the look and expanded it as well. It's a very open space, modern, and lots of natural light. Long tables for bigger parties, private seating to have alone time or group seating which was perfect for us. A nice sitting environment to chat with friends over good eats, a cup of tea/coffee or to read/study. There were people casually sitting with their notes, laptop or books with a drink. They have a community calendar which was nice to see. It provides a sense of caring for the community. The specials for the day were listed on a board upon entering which was a nice summary in addition to the menus and the board above the counter. The desserts were cased by the registers and all looked scrumptious! The tea - never saw so many options in one place for consumption! I definitely will have to try the coffee next time, we came for lunch.    The Food:  Their food is pretty darn good taste-wise and health-wise! Their options are generally local, grass-fed, or organic, gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options, which we appreciated. It felt really great knowing that we were eating well without breaking our wallets and the best part was that everything was delicious too. We ordered the Power Salad, Roasted Vegetable Sandwich - that came yummy veggie (terra) chips, a vegan peanut butter cookie that you will LOVE I promise even if you are not vegan (which we aren't), and a peanut butter cake with chocolate ganache which we split as well and all enjoyed!  I would definitely recommend OCF, the staff were all ready and willing to answer any question we had. They offered suggestions based on questions they asked and they were so pleasant. Our food came out quick and service was excellent!

"We've come to this place a million times over the past few years however The last day 4 or 5 visits have been a bust. I don't know what happened but many of the servers are new and have consistently messed up our orders. This last visit I walked in at 8:30 to grab a Pho to go. The guy told me the kitchen is closed so they couldn't serve me. The sign clearly says they close at 9. And I just wanted a soup. TO-GO. I mean, I get it but if that's the case then change your sign to read 8:30 pm. Not 9. Is that too much to ask? Needless to say that was the last straw and We won't ever be going there again.

"For whatever reason reviews are good on this place. This restaurant is a tiny place on the middle of an industrial area. The dishes really cater to non-spicy palates with several dishes that are way too sweet and too runny (i.e.. Both the green and the red curries are very soup-y, non spicy and almost sugary). The place also caters to more Western taste with a number of dishes that are neither thai nor fusion (i.e. Stake and ribs).  I ended up here with family on a celebration. I made reservation at 8 not knowing that their kitchen closes around 8:15-8:30 (this wasn't mentioned anywhere on OpenTable and reservations are allowed up until 15 minutes before the kitchen closes!). While we were there, we ordered our mains and the waitress didn't indicate the kitchen was closing so we couldn't make further orders for dessert or anything past 8:30. By 9 we were already out. The bill came to $120 for three dishes and an appetizer and without alcohol.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
Came here with a group of friends. The restaurant was semi busy but nothing that service couldn't handle. Atleast that's what I thought.   We were sitting in the bar area and ordered our drinks and waited probably 15 mins for the overpriced margarita pitcher that was lacking alcohol and from here it only got worse. Our entire table ran out of Chips and Salsa and were never refilled even after asking multiple times to multiple servers.   When our food finally came out it was okay but nothing I'd ever crave. I could get the same or better food anywhere else for cheaper.   Toward the end of dinner we were going to try and order another pitcher of margaritas before heading to the bars but the server just never came back after dropping the checks off the same time our food was dropped off.   Some of the worst service I've ever received.,Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0

"| The Chronic...Tacos |  C.T. is similar to other made to order Mexican influenced chains like Chipotle and Moe's.

"I agree with Previous! I too am from up North and had high expectations! It was towards the end of the night but instead of my bread being hard it was very soggy!

The fries had no flavor except for old grease that needed to be changed a long time ago.  Very disappointed to say the least! I tried to talk and joke with them but mostly it was like being in a nail salon where they say yes and nod but have no idea what you are saying. Uncomfortable.

"3.5 stars.  Ms Michelle C steered me to this place earlier in the week. It's in a small shop across the street from the strip mall with the Dunkin Donuts and pizza place on Haddon Ave. The decor is pretty minimal, but I""m about the food, not the fru fru.  I ordered the enchiladas verdes and some horchata. The waitress brought out some chips and salsa. The one odd thing was that they put refried beans on top of the chips, which made it a bit messy to eat. The salsa was a red salsa, not too thick and not too thin and full of spice. By the time I got done eating the chips and salsa my nose was running. The horchata was sweet and had a lot of cinnamon in it. It helped quench the fire of the salsa.  The enchiladas came out on a big plate. The verdes sauce covered the enchiladas and the plate, which gave me a flashback to Plaza Garibaldi. However, this verdes sauce was very tasty. You could tell they made there own verdes sauce with fresh tomatillos. Either that or they found the best canned tomatillos. The chicken enchiladas pretty good, as was the mexican rice, which had some peas and carrots cut up in it.  I will definitely be back to try some of their other dishes. The tacos sounded really good.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

"It's not that the food is bad, it just wasn't good enough to make up for the time spent, the inattentive service, and the $40 bill for lunch for two. I know I have to pay $2 or $3 for a Coke these days. This is made infinitely more painful when it is not refilled. The only thing a server can do that is almost as annoying as not refilling drinks is making me wait for the check, especially at lunch. We waited and waited and waited with our dirty plates and empty glasses.  I know that generally breakfast is a racket and it's not like I haven't paid $20 for lunch before.

"This was very disappointing for a new sushi place in town. I understand working out the kinks in a brand new establishment, but there's no excuse to be understaffed, have minimal stock on hand, have awkward service from your staff, and bad ambiance. There was one sushi chef trying to serve the entire bar and floor tables, and he was getting no support from the staff in the kitchen (it took us over 30 minutes to get our mussels which we ordered as soon as we sat down). The sound system wasn't playing in the place so it was awkward silence of customers trying to whisper to each other, and because the chef was trying to move so quickly, some of the rolls didn't taste very good. The chef and the hostess were arguing with each other in Spanish and they were out of ginger...which come to find out, was sitting at the bar the entire time - the staff just didn't look. Finally over an hour into our meal, more wait staff and a chef showed up. The service improved slightly however there was lots of confusion happening between the chefs and our orders were messed up a few times (we had to keep clarifying and repeating ourselves). Finally we gave up on our meal and asked for the check so we could quickly leave. Unfortunately there are far too many better sushi places to go to and we won't be coming back.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0

"We love Thai food!  Apparently we passed that love on to our children, because our son-in-law told me that he was learning to love it from our daughter.  We were recently staying at a resort on St. Pete's Beach and went to Nori Thai after our daughter recommended it...and it was close! We don't know quite what to make of the Thai/Sushi combination, but just ended up ordering Thai.  We ordered everything ""hot,"" which was spicy but manageable.  We didn't need to add any spice, but could have stood it a little hotter. The basil spring rolls were tasty, and the peanut sauce is rumored to be made from scratch.  The ""Thai-tanic"" soup was nice...a bowl for one instead of family style like we usually see. For main courses we had a ""fishermans platter"" served in a clay pot, which was tasty, and red-curry with coconut and chicken just like we get at home.  The food was great and we took home the left overs. Honestly, the best part was the service.  Maybe it's the language barrier at some of the places we go, but we both noticed that the wait staff at Nori Thai was the friendliest we've seen in a long time.  Between drinks, ordering and being served we saw 4 different waitresses at our table.  We were told that they all ""share"" customers.

I got a philly sandwich and thought it might be worth a try. After tax and tip it was maybe $15, so not too bad. I get there and they were just a bit behind, so after maybe twenty seconds of sitting they came and gave me chicken noodle soup for free, and by the way it was fantastic. They give me this huge bag that I knew couldn't just be a sandwich. I open it up and it came with a free side and even a piece of cake. It was easily one of the best sandwiches I have had. I have now been there for breakfast twice now and each time is better than the last.

"Yowza. We met some friends for dinner, and this was their pick. Lolita is a very intimate space. The tables are close together and people sometimes have to squeeze behind you. But that said, it manages to be close quarters without feeling like you don't have your private space and you can't talk with your tablemates. It's an odd feat of restaurant engineering but it works. We had reservations (would highly recommend). So we were able to walk in and be seated immediately even on a busy night.  This is upscale Mexican and everything we had was delicious. We got the traditional guacamole to start, which was delicious and creamy and came with the most delicous basket of not only ""regular"" chips but also plantain chips and chips that very much reminded me of Terra Chips. Super yummy. We also got the toro tartare appetizer, which was served on more of those little chips and was absolutely delicious.  Entree-wise, I got the chicken enchiladas, which were very good and way too much food for even me to eat. But I did have ordering envy. My husband got the carne asada, which turned out to be an absolutely spot on perfectly cooked mid-rare filet with a bunch of other stuff. It was melt in your mouth perfection.

"I've only been here twice, and it's been because someone else wanted to go.  That being said, isn't the best sushi you'll ever have, but it's good.  They have not only sushi rolls, but also fried rice, egg rolls, dumplings, fresh orange, and even fried bananas.    My first trip here I was pretty confused - I just didn't know how it ""worked"".  I realized quickly that during dinner hours, each plate has a colored ring, and each color corresponds to a price.  So, as you choose your plates from the conveyor belt, the server tallies them up and that's how they charge you.  However, at lunch, it's ""all you can eat"" for $12.95 I believe.  It's easy to overdo it for sure!   The best suggestion I can make is to come around 12-12:30, when the lunch rush hits.  This is when I've seen a good variety, and since there are a lot of people in the restaurant, items are moving quicker & thus fresher.  We came this last time around 12, and the place was packed.  As we were leaving (around 1:15), however, the restaurant had thinned out and I noticed some rolls had been on the belt for at least 15 or more minutes.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0

The food is what you'd expect from a Taco Bell, and the staff is noticeably more polite than the average fast food establishment.

I've been through literally dozens of times and have ordered cinnamon twists, and almost 100% of the time they do not end up in the bag and I have disappointed kids when I get home.  It is not just one (1) particular employee:  No matter who is working the drive thru, it is almost a sure bet that the cinnamon twists will remain on the shelf and not make it to the bag.

If you are looking for a 'buffet-type' restaurant, do not bother coming here. The table where I was seated had four built-in hot pots. I have never cooked in a hot pot, and I did not this time. BUT, I will the next time I visit. The staff was wonderful and explained everything about how cooking hot pot worked along with the menu items that complemented this type of cooking. However, I chose Szechuan beef along with a hearty helping of WonTon soup. The spices in both were perfect. Many times, you feel that many restaurants break open a sauce packet or even a meal that they serve you. This was absolutely the best Szechuan beef I ever had. I look forward to going back and attempting cooking in the hot pots! This is a 'must' restaurant tucked back in a strip center.

Well once the food arrived from our maybe 18 year old very in experienced waiter, I felt yes I was correct on the value vs food thing!   Also service quality vs price point is off!  The food was very tasty and of good quality just not much of it and everything more is of extra price!  Overall not a bad place but not gonna have me running back soon!  Just OK!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"Best restaurant in New Orleans! Jeremy the manager was the most accommodating manager we've ever encountered. Food is off the charts. Atmosphere, food, service, etc rules!!! Oysters are the best in the French Quarter!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Went for a lunch. Was seated in a sunny back room with view of the river and while the decor was dated, it was pleasant and clean. Quiet enough for enjoyable conversation without background clamor. Good place for catching up with friends.   Service was good, not too fast or interruptive. My lunch mate had the cheesesteak and fries which looked great (they said it was)!  Unfortunately I chose the daily special which was broccoli quiche.  It looked like it was left over from the previous day. It seemed like it was reheated via microwave. The crust was soggy and it tasted very plain.   Side salad was a bit wilted. But I will definitely be going back to try again.  Next time I will go for a sandwich.",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 3.0
"We were so disappointed in our service. This is a neat location, but was quite slow for a Saturday night. Right off the bat the hostess took several minutes to notice us, then we asked to sit outside and were told there was no seating (however there were multiple empty tables the entire time we were there). Then the delays really started. Our waiter took forever to even get our drink order, so we ordered our meal at the same time. Then we waited... and waited... no apology, no excuses, just never saw him. The table next to us had salad and bread... we never saw any bread. Had to chase him down for the one refill we got, but the food was good when we finally got it. Sadly, we missed a trip to the arch because we sat there for so long",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"My friend suggested coming here to order some take-out for the plane ride back to SF.  The Beef Chow Fun was $8.99, slightly more than usual... The dish smelled pretty good and also had decent ""wok hai.""  ...unfortunately, the ingredients weren't so fresh, esp the Chow Fun Noodles. The Beef was also missing some meat tenderizer, resulting in very coarse pieces of beef...  ..they do accept credit cards tho!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 2.0
"If I didn't eat it so fast, I would've taken a picture. I came across Aroma because I started a new job and was looking for places to go for lunch. This is about to become a dangerous habit (eating there all the time). I ordered the chicken kabobs. EVERYTHING, including the rice and soup, was DELICIOUS! Any poor comments left on here are probably from the small percentage of people that are impossible to please. I definitely recommend Aroma!",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 5.0
"Four of us went to eat here earlier tonight. Enjoying ourselves when a cockroach flew and landed on the neck of someone in our party, as he slapped it off it went into his lap and then flew off. This was absolutely disgusting. To top it off, the staff was so whatever about it all. It was obviously a big deal to us but we never even had a manager approach us to apologize, not even the waitress apologized! There needs to be an inspection here soon! I am still disgusted",Business Category: Restaurants,Review Stars: 1.0
